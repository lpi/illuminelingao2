# Chapter 2856: Coconut Grove Photo Studio

Since Senator Huang took charge of the photo studio project, he immediately went all out... no, he started organizing it on a grand scale. The photo studio was selected on a side street in Bairen Town. It was not far from the prosperous main street, yet quiet enough. Compared to other trades, photo studios rely less on impulse consumption and mainly on word-of-mouth. However, it couldn't be too far from the downtown area; if consumers found it hard to locate, it would lose a lot of walk-in business.

In the old timeline, due to marketing means like the internet and TV, it didn't matter much if a photo studio wasn't in a commercial district. As long as the ability to attract customers was strong, being in an office building or commercial center was fine. But in this timeline, it still had to be in a commercial district and have a relatively obvious storefront display.

As a TV laborer who used to go out to make a living every few days, Huang Yaomin had also moonlighted in wedding videography, private photography, and the like, so he was quite familiar with this stuff. Therefore, he put quite a bit of thought into the site selection.

The frontage of the photo studio wasn't large, only two bays. One was the main entrance, and the other was a show window. Displayed in the window were various "sample photos." This was also the customary mode of traditional photo studios. Because of limitations in equipment, film, and personnel, wedding photography and art photos couldn't be too fancy yet. Marketing could only focus on daily life, mainly various commemorative photos and candid shots.

Since there was no need for elaborate wedding photography or art photos, naturally, there wasn't a need for too many sets and props, so the scale of the photo studio wasn't large.

The first floor, besides the business hall, had a small photography studio used to satisfy daily photography projects and such. The second floor was more exquisite and was also the focus of Senator Huang's marketing.

To garner maximum attention, he adopted a greenhouse-style design for the second floor, carving out a terrace area that occupied two-thirds of the entire second floor. Except for a small part kept open-air, this huge terrace used a greenhouse design, with glass embedded in iron frames from the roof to the walls.

Adopting this design was quite bold in Lingao. After all, the average temperature here was high, and the greenhouse would likely turn into a hothouse most of the time. Huang Yaomin did this not purely for "eye-catching" purposes but largely to satisfy the lighting needs of photography.

The Senate's lighting industry could now mass-produce some lighting fixtures, including kerosene lamps, gas lamps, carbide lamps, carbon arc lamps, and carbon filament lamps that had only appeared in recent years. Some lamps had considerable lumen output. However, in Senator Huang's view, most were not very suitable for indoor studio lighting and had certain safety issues. Moreover, there was a bit of his personal aesthetic preference involved.

So he decided to use natural light as much as possible. This greenhouse-style studio was designed according to his philosophy. Due to the shortage of lighting equipment, the Senate had conducted a lot of research and practice on how to fully utilize natural light, giving birth to a rather complex shading system composed of various curtains, blinds, tracks, and reflectors. Coconut Grove Photo Studio's greenhouse studio also introduced this system, personally set up by Lin Hanlong, the head of the Optical Factory. By adjusting this system, satisfactory light could be introduced into the studio under various weather conditions.

This technology wasn't an original creation of the Senators. In his writings, Leonardo da Vinci of the 16th century wrote about how to build a venue suitable for obtaining the best light for portrait painting, how to arrange the distance between the model and the painter in different weather, and a technology closely related to photographers: "camera obscura projection."

Lin Hanlong's system was extremely ingenious. Not only did it come with a specialized manual, but a technician was also sent specifically to the photo studio to conduct training.

Since heavy capital was spent on this lighting system, the second-floor studio naturally had to create high-value products to recoup costs. Therefore, this studio was mainly used to meet the needs of mid-to-high-end customers. Although color photography wasn't possible yet, it didn't hurt to prepare more props and costumes. For this reason, he specially custom-ordered many high-end costumes from Wanzi Pavilion.

Photography was a new thing, and most common people had no concept of it. Except for naturalized citizens who needed photos for IDs and files upon employment, ordinary people had no experience taking photos, nor any demand. So this trade had to cultivate customer consumption habits from scratch.

Fortunately, after the industrial sector could stably produce photography consumables, the Senate began to implement an ID photo system. With the promotion of ID documents among the entire population, Coconut Grove Photo Studio wouldn't worry about business.

However, Senator Huang looked down on this kind of business fed by administrative policy. Ambitious, he wanted to open up more business.

Referencing the life cycle of photo studios in the old timeline, it roughly started with introduction in the late Qing Dynasty, initially viewed as "soul-stealing," then gradually accepted by the public in the 1920s with commercial photo studios appearing, then becoming "fashionable" after the 1930s, popularized after the 1950s, with wedding photography rising suddenly in the 1990s, and finally declining with the popularization of digital photography in the early 21st century. Most areas of Hainan Island right now could probably be considered in the "1920s" phase—common people at least no longer treated photography as "sorcery." As for Guangzhou, it was temporarily still at the late Qing level.

Since photography wasn't treated as sorcery, there was prospect for commercialization. But the common people didn't have consumption habits yet, which needed his guidance and cultivation.

Fortunately, Lingao had a huge advantage: among all areas under the Senate's jurisdiction, this was the place where the media industry had penetrated deepest. There were over twenty types of popular newspapers and magazines alone, with subscriptions covering more than 40% of the total population. Photos published in newspapers and magazines acted as advertisements, subconsciously integrating the concept of photography into life.

Of course, this alone wasn't enough. So Huang Yaomin also discussed an advertising cooperation project with Ding Ding to run continuous ads for the photo studio in major newspapers and magazines under the Media Group for a year. Besides ordinary ads, it included several soft ads, mainly promoting concepts like "go to the photo studio for photos," "take photos to commemorate important days," and "keep the most beautiful moments" through stories, novels, and comic strips.

He also discussed cooperation with the operators of the Lattice Skirt Club. He would take formula photos for their "troupe" for free to be placed on the actor wall of the small theater, and promised to shoot a photo album for members for free after photography technology improved, in exchange for the convenience of promoting the photo studio in the theater.

Naturally, Guangzhou was also under Senator Huang's care, but right now he couldn't attend to it. After all, the level of photography resources given to him was too LOW. He would develop in Lingao first, familiarizing himself with the technology while training a batch of technical backbones.

Senator Huang walked around the photo studio, "inspecting and guiding" the work. Coconut Grove Photo Studio was about to open; the hardware was basically in place, and the remaining "software engineering" like various decorations and accessories was being rushed. It wouldn't take more than three or five days. He calculated that Coconut Grove Photo Studio could officially open before the next rest day arrived.

Looking at the "studio" he had built with his own hands, Senator Huang couldn't help but feel smug. Pity he couldn't run a TV station yet, or he'd have insisted on being a Station Chief...

Seeing the bustling work outside with nothing left for him to guide, he decided to take a few photos of his maid first to test the quality of the newly delivered equipment and chemicals. Due to quality control issues, the performance of each batch of consumables wasn't quite the same. Without actually shooting to see, he couldn't be sure.

He asked the maid to change clothes, then walked into the darkroom himself. First putting on gloves and a mask, feeling like he was entering a chemical site—he had no choice; currently, he was allocated a wet plate camera, so he had to play with the ancient wet collodion process. Some materials in wet plate DIY were flammable and toxic, so cherish life, start with personal safety. He took out distilled water, a basin, a gram scale, an alcohol lamp, beakers, stirring rods, a large funnel, test tubes, graduated cylinders, filter paper, a glass cutter, and a silver nitrate bath. Everything was ready; work began.

First, pour the prepared collodion onto the glass plate, letting the collodion quickly cover the entire plate, then pour the excess back into the bottle. Shake the glass plate to make the emulsion surface smooth and uniform. Place it into the silver nitrate bath to sensitize it. Wait four minutes, take out the glass plate, wipe the back clean with paper, and load it into the film holder. returning to the studio, Huang Yaomin signaled the maid to sit in front of the blue cloth background (because wet plates are only sensitive to ultraviolet, blue, and some visible light, and weak to warm light). He used an iron stand to support the back of her head, fixing it in place. In the era when wet plates were born, due to the long exposure time, to get a good photo, one had to remain absolutely still for 5 to 10 seconds, not even blinking. Arranging the gas lamps, wrapping them in white cloth, adjusting the focus... he loaded the film holder into the camera, opened the lens cap (the shutter of a wet plate camera was the lens cap), waited five seconds, covered the lens cap, took out the film holder, and returned to the darkroom. He poured the developer, shook the glass plate vigorously, and an image appeared after 6-8 seconds. He stopped development around 15 seconds, rinsed directly with water, fixed with fixer after washing, and dried it, making the image brighter and brighter, finally finishing with varnish.

Huang Yaomin looked at the final image. Succeeding on the first try, the effect was quite good. However, an Asian female with nude makeup in this black and white photo still wasn't as photogenic as a Western horse. *Looks like I need to report to the General Office next time to approve a special fee or something.* Those just now were warm-ups; now for the real deal. He swept his eyes over the maid's clothes and signaled. The maid was stunned at first, then immediately understood—she had been a photography model for Senator Huang more than once. Even so, the maid still acted coy first. Just as she was blushing and heading to the changing room, Huang Yaomin's Little PHS rang...
