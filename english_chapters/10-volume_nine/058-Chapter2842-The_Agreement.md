# Chapter 2842 The Agreement

"Let's not talk about this." Seeing Yang Zhaodi's expression grow gloomy, Tan Shuangxi quickly turned his head to the side, pretending to look at the calm river surface, steadying his own emotions. He drove Yang Zhaodi's image from his mind. A few more glances, and perhaps he'd change his decision.

"When the north is liberated, or when I don't need to go to battle anymore, I'll come home for matchmaking and live a peaceful life. But I also don't know what else I could do. Maybe even salt-drying won't want me anymore." Tan Shuangxi suddenly laughed as he spoke, but still didn't turn back.

The two sat in silence, each gazing at the calm river surface outside the window. Dusk had begun to fall. The Wenlan River glittered with golden light. Someone—who knows who first—chuckled. Then the two exchanged knowing smiles. Today's matchmaking was undoubtedly a failure, but this feeling was a kind of beauty neither had ever experienced before.

Leaving the teahouse, though the matchmaking had ended, somehow...

"Shuangxi-ge," Yang Zhaodi broke the silence as they walked down the riverbank and could already see East Gate Market's public carriage station in the distance. "Since you don't want to marry and I don't want to be married off, going home like this will just mean being arranged to meet more people. How about we tell our families that we two are..." She couldn't finish the last few words. Her voice had become as small as a mosquito's.

The meaning couldn't have been simpler. Tan Shuangxi understood instantly. But he couldn't find a word to describe it either. What should he say? Seeing each other? Together... In his limited family education, all he'd heard was "parents' orders and matchmaker's words." And though Fubo Army education did include social reform content about marriage freedom, to them these lessons were like chanting sutras—they hadn't really felt anything.

"Dating?... Okay." Tan Shuangxi finally found a new word in his mind. Intuition told him this word represented feelings between two people—a description transcending the level of being suitable for living together.

"That's what I mean. This way Mom won't pressure me anymore." Yang Zhaodi nodded with her head down, hands fidgeting with her clothes. Hearing Tan Shuangxi's affirmative answer, she finally raised her head and smiled happily. On the side of her face turned toward Tan Shuangxi, a small dimple appeared.

"Zhaodi... Yang Zhaodi..." A woman in a checked cloth jacket waved at them from across the road.

"Sister Mei..." Yang Zhaodi waved back excitedly, then explained to Tan Shuangxi: "This is Sister Mei from accounting class. She's the class beauty, you know." She winked meaningfully at Tan Shuangxi. Yang Zhaodi clearly wanted to walk along with this Sister Mei. But Tan Shuangxi had no interest in meeting this Sister Mei, so they parted there. After exchanging the usual courtesies of "see you again," Yang Zhaodi still hesitantly added: "Come find me at the farm when you have time. I'll show you the experimental fields. Guaranteed you've never seen anything like them." With that, she skipped across the road, and the two women walked arm in arm toward East Gate Market, chatting warmly.

The setting sun was sinking into the distant horizon. The Wenlan River was like a golden ribbon, winding around this fertile land. Sunset light pierced through the leaves, shining on Tan Shuangxi's face, making him feel warm and peaceful. The world had never been so beautiful. Fate had never been so unpredictable. In this new world created by the Senate, Tan Shuangxi and Yang Zhaodi no longer followed the trajectory of life and death that could be seen at a glance. They imagined a vast world and infinite possibilities. And fate had finally smiled upon them.

Tan Shuangxi returned home and slept soundly. He'd been running around for days. Lingao itself wasn't large, but he'd covered it all. Now he desperately needed proper rest to relax his nerves.

He woke to find the sun already high. Seeing sunlight on the white lime walls, he panicked: so late!

Years of military life had given him the habit of rising early. Even on leave at home, he felt guilty about sleeping in during the day.

He got up and dressed. Under the bed, his mother had prepared a pair of cork-soled rattan sandals—also a new thing these past few years, though farmers rarely wore them. After all, cork soles wore out quickly—one day of farm work would ruin them.

It seemed his family was treating him as a guest. Tan Shuangxi shook his head and walked to the main hall. Breakfast sat on the table under a bamboo cover—a bowl of dried rice noodles with prepared sauce to mix them.

Tan Shuangxi smiled. Indeed they were treating him as a guest. He took his rinse cup and towel to the courtyard, scooped water from the water jar, and washed up. Though brushing teeth was an important part of the Senate's "New Life Movement," the habit remained uncommon in rural areas. Plus toothbrush and tooth powder were an expense. So those mainly affected were soldiers, workers, and relatively wealthy families with children in school.

After washing, Tan Shuangxi sat in the courtyard with his big bowl, chopsticks stirring the rice noodles to mix in the sauce. It was a bright sunny day with warm sunlight, yet a cool breeze made the courtyard quite comfortable.

He set bowl and chopsticks on the courtyard table, picked a fresh crisp cucumber from the vegetable-washing tub, shook off the water, and ate alternating bites of cucumber and rice noodles.

The pumpkin flowers on the fence were in full bloom. White cabbage butterflies fluttered up and down. The road outside the fence was quiet—everyone had gone to work. Only he was this leisurely and idle. He hadn't been like this in a long time.

His family's house had just been rebuilt not long ago. The design used the "New Village Planning" model home blueprints. Roughly three main rooms, left and right wing rooms, with front and rear courtyards. Convenient for living and good for courtyard economy too.

His parents clearly hadn't put much effort into the courtyard. Besides a few vegetable beds for their own use and the pigs raised in the back, there weren't really any "projects." Father, mother, and brother—three people tending over a hundred *mu* of land was indeed busy enough.

His family wasn't far from Maniao. Under Senate administrative divisions, it belonged to "Maniao Town" but weren't "stove households"—they had no salt pans or salt troughs. Fortunately, his family still had a few *mu* of farmland. During the dry season's salt field busy period each autumn, they'd do odd jobs; when spring rains came, they'd return home to tend the fields. Except for those few years when Master Gou seized the salt fields, life had been marginally acceptable.

After the Australians came, land and tax records were cleared up. The Heavenly Land Society was established. Though the Tan family's annual taxes weren't less, all the miscellaneous "fees" were swept away, lightening the burden considerably. After Tan Shuangxi joined the army, they enjoyed many benefits. His father and brother had the family business running smoothly. They no longer went to do odd jobs at the salt fields—that hard work was now done by new migrants from the mainland.

His family hadn't contracted their land to the Heavenly Land Society. Instead, they gradually bought up land from other village families—all thanks to Tan Shuangxi sending back his military pay and wartime bonuses. His parents saved these remittances bit by bit, seizing opportunities to buy others' land.

No matter the timeline, what rural people lacked most was cash. When selling land, they often couldn't get good prices. The Tan elders, thanks to Tan Shuangxi's remittances, had comfortable cash reserves. Plus these past few years, more and more people went to the city to "work," many selling their land cheaply and moving to towns. So the Tan family had gradually accumulated over a hundred *mu*.

Old couple Tan were just past fifty—still in their prime and able to work. Tan Shuangxi's brother Tan Shuangqing was seventeen or eighteen. For farming, they'd taken out a loan to buy two Simmental cattle. By rural standards, this counted as "flourishing family business." The newly built house, the stored lumber—all indicated the family was planning a happy occasion. Naturally, the main character of this happy event was him.

To say Tan Shuangxi didn't want to marry would be nonsense. He was a normal man—a strapping fellow in his mid-twenties who'd been in an all-male military. How could he not think about women? As they said: three years in the army, even an old sow has double eyelids. Tan Shuangxi had been in for more than three years.

"Yellow tickets" provided temporary release, but as he grew older, he always felt something missing beside him. In the military, life was tense and orderly—this sense of emptiness was easily filled. These days home on leave, waking in the middle of the night, loneliness and emptiness were like a pair of strong hands constantly kneading his heart.

"Perhaps it's time to start a family."

Tan Shuangxi fell into a contradiction. On one hand, he didn't want extra worries at home when going to battle, nor did he want to burden a good woman if he died or was disabled. On the other hand, having a woman who knew cold and warmth by his side, someone waiting when he came home on leave...

Thinking of this, Yang Zhaodi's every smile seemed to float before his eyes again. He suddenly realized what his careless promise yesterday meant—silently regretting it. That little minx was too clever by half!

Though he understood this agreement had no benefit for him, Yang Zhaodi's flower-like smile still kept him from resenting it.

Forget it. What was done was done—no regret medicine to take. Tan Shuangxi put down bowl and chopsticks, swallowed the last bite of cucumber. He thought about doing something for the household.

The courtyard was swept clean. The vegetable beds were watered. Even the clothes and bedding he'd brought back—Mother had washed them spotless and hung them out to dry. The pigs and chickens in the back were fed. Tan Shuangxi walked around but found nothing to do.

His parents' diligence he'd seen since childhood. But that diligence hadn't brought the family much benefit in the past—just barely maintaining the family's livelihood. Compared to now, it truly was "new sun and moon, vast heaven and earth."

Since there was nothing to do at home, he might as well stroll around the village. See if the elders were still around, how his childhood companions were doing.
