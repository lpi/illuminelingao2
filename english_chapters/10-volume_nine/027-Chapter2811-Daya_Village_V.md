# Chapter 2811 Daya Village (V)

The fish fillet was richly fragrant, golden in color and soft in texture, without even a hint of char—far removed from the blackish dried fish in his memory.

"Delicious!" Tan Shuangxi praised. "I've had fish fillet before, but most of it was dry. Nothing this... tender..."

"This is the Australian method, oven-roasted by machine." The village head said. "The Chen family built their own factory and bought several machines specifically for roasting fish fillets."

"Machinery? The Chen family is that rich?!" Tan Shuangxi was quite surprised. Outfitting a single new fishing boat was already a considerable sum, let alone machinery.

"Loan. One percent annual interest." The village head's face was flushed. "The Heaven and Earth Society guaranteed it. Otherwise, they haven't even paid off the loan for the fishing boats yet!"

"This Heaven and Earth Society is closer than his own father."

"What talk! Does his father have this kind of money?!" The village head said. "These fish fillets sell well; times better than selling the fish itself. Every day, dozens of crates of roasted fish fillet are shipped to Lingao, then repackaged and sold on to the mainland and to Nanyang... They say the Red Hairs and the Dwarf Pirates' emperors can't even eat without their roasted fish fillet..."

Everyone laughed with a "you're really laying it on thick" expression. The village accountant laughed and said: "That's an exaggeration. The Chen family does contract processing for the Heaven and Earth Society. Who knows who gets the packaged goods after that. But the contract processing business is already big enough. More than half of the women in the village do odd jobs at their factory now. Just the daily wage payout—how much cash flow is that, tsk tsk..."

The stationed police officer, speaking in a Shandong-accented New Speech, joined in: "When I first came to Qiongzhou, I tried the village fish fillet too—completely different thing from this one now. I think this flavor actually tastes more like my hometown. We call our place Jiaoao; it's a small place. We have roasted fish there too; tastes more like this. Maybe the Chief who made this machine's ancestors were also from Shandong."

Tan Shuangxi remembered seeing a report in the *Lingao Times*—something called "The Amazing Roasted Fish Fillet"—that also said Lingao's roasted fish fillet had sold into a big market. So it was talking about Daya Village all along. To think the unremarkable Chen family of fishermen was now running such a big business. He had thought Sergeant Ma's family business was big enough, but there's always a higher mountain—the Chen family's reluctance to send their own sons off to be soldiers was understandable now.

Looking at the several young men at the head table being surrounded with toasts, feeding and drinking, he felt increasingly uneasy. Using the excuse of toasting, he sat down beside the young man substituting for Chen Kecai and chatted a bit. He learned this young man had only come over from the mainland about a year ago, assigned to settle in Daya Village and working as a fishing hand on the Chen family's boat.

"You weren't born a fisherman?" Tan Shuangxi was somewhat surprised. "Can you handle it?"

"Got seasick a lot at first, but adapted later." The young man said carelessly. "Working on a fishing boat is hard, but the money is several times what you'd get as a farmhand. Tough it out a few years and you can earn enough to buy land and build a house."

"Where's your old home?"

"Renqiu County, Hejian Prefecture, Beizhili."

Tan Shuangxi had no clue where Hejian Prefecture, Renqiu County was, but thanks to army education, he knew Beizhili was where the Ming capital was located.

"Beizhili—isn't that near the capital..."

"We're still quite a distance from the capital." The young man poured Tan Shuangxi a full cup. "Squad Leader, please drink..."

Tan Shuangxi noticed the young man was quite articulate, not the slow, honest type he'd imagined. He asked: "Looking at you, your family back home wasn't in farming either, right? How did you end up in Lingao?"

"Still because of the war!" The young man said with some resignation. "Our old home, truth be told, was better than here. Flat terrain, not as many hills, more cultivable land, and plenty of rivers too. In drought years, as long as it wasn't a dry year, carrying water to farm was manageable. Our cucumbers and radishes there were especially delicious. Especially cucumbers—bite into one with the flower still on and thorns still prickly, sweet and crisp like nothing else. My family were tenants, but Dad had the skill for pickling vegetables. In the slack season, he'd go to Baoding Prefecture to help people pickle vegetables. Earned money to pay the rent. The landlord liked my dad's pickled vegetables too; we'd send him a few hundred *jin* every year. Though we didn't get a single coin, when something came up, the landlord would help. So life was passable.

"Then it all fell apart. In the seventh year of Chongzhen, the Tartars invaded, and the whole province was thrown into chaos. Before the Tartars even reached us, we suffered from soldiers' disasters. The county magistrate led the yamen runners to 'collect grain donations,' saying they were going to invite government troops to come. After the government troops arrived, 'collection' turned straight into plunder—said they couldn't leave anything for the Tartars. My dad learned the news on his way to deliver vegetables to the landlord. He couldn't make it back in time to fetch us. Luckily, he knew about an empty tomb outside the village that had been robbed. He'd secretly hidden grain there, which kept us from starving. Those who hadn't hidden their grain well later starved. Nobody dared to help them—if you helped, it meant your family still had surplus grain. The whole village was starving; they'd strip you clean.

"Then the Tartars came. Our whole family hid in that tomb for days and didn't dare come out. When we emerged, the village was gone. All the houses burned, corpses everywhere in the village, mostly women. All raped to death. Old Wang next door's daughter, just ten years old, was dead in the courtyard. Stripped naked—raped to death. Blood trail from the main room to the courtyard. Don't know how long she crawled before she died. Too many dead. We didn't dare collect the bodies—afraid the Tartars would come back and find people still alive. So we tossed the nearby corpses into the well and pushed down a wall as a sort of burial.

"Later we learned those killed on the spot at least died clean. Those captured were worse. Couldn't walk and it was a single knife. On the road, no food, no water, disease killed off a batch. Worked as beasts of burden, portering stuff, worked to death. Hit a siege, and the Tartars drove them onto the battlefield. Defending soldiers' cannons and arrows came over, dying in heaps. You don't go forward, Tartars behind kill you one by one. Go forward, killed by government troops. Go back, killed by Tartars. The captured women... even more pitiful! You know what the Tartars called them? *Shengkou*—'living mouths,' same pronunciation as 'livestock.' Actually, they weren't even livestock.

"My dad said this place was no good to stay. He led the whole family south, thinking once we crossed the Yellow River, it'd be peaceful—Tartars wouldn't chase past the Yellow River. But we didn't even reach the Yellow River before our travel money ran out. Mom died too. Grain was long gone; we survived by begging until we got to Kaifeng. Too many refugees; the garrison wouldn't let people in. Shot arrows and killed quite a few. My dad was hit too. Total chaos. I got separated from my family. In a daze, I followed the crowd and kept walking south. They said once you got to Jiangnan, there'd be a way to live. Got to Jiangnan, then somehow ended up in Lingao."

To Tan Shuangxi, such stories were nothing remarkable—too common. Nine out of ten men in the platoon had such pasts.

"If you've finally settled down, why do you want to go be a soldier again?" Tan Shuangxi couldn't help asking. "Think being a fishing hand is too hard?"

"This hardship is nothing," the fishing hand said. "When it comes to suffering, nobody beats us dirt farmers. It's good here; I'd be happy to stay my whole life. But I can't let go of my siblings..." Here his voice dropped. "I know nine out of ten of them are already gone. But I'm clinging to that one hope: what if they're still alive? Even if they're slaves, or servants, or concubines—at least they're still living... I keep thinking, can I find them and bring them back? At worst, find even one, bring them back so we can live together and have a family again..."

"But I'm just one person, weak and alone. Escaping alive to Lingao was already heaven's great luck. How dare I go back to the mainland? Heard from people who came later: Henan and Beizhili are even more chaotic now. So when the Chen family asked if I'd be willing to go be a soldier, I agreed immediately. Enlist and I can follow the troops to find my family!"

Tan Shuangxi looked at the slightly agitated young man, momentarily at a loss for words. He could only pat him on the shoulder.

Over there, the village head, drunk and reeking of liquor, had his arm around Zhang Laicai's neck, mumbling: "Brother, this trip of yours—our village lost a man... In a few days, another team comes, a few more notifications, a few more men gone."

Before Zhang Laicai could react, the stationed police officer sharing drinks slammed his cup on the table. "Fu Lao'er, you goddamn dog! Life got better and you forgot your roots! You know damn well how you got this big house and your duck farm—you earned it yourself, sure, but we earned it too, bullets flying at us in Chengmai. Can't beat you to death, you dog." With that, he grabbed the village head by the collar.

The village head wasn't angry at all. He wrapped his arm around the stationed police officer's neck in return and kept rambling: "Old Xie! Old Xie! What do you know... Li Haoze was the best young man in the village. Every time he saw me, so polite, cultured, and handsome too. I even wanted to marry my daughter to him—but my girl has no education; I thought she wasn't good enough. I figured a young man like him, going to military academy, would have a great future ahead. Might even become a big cadre someday! Look at you—served one year and got a police job. If he became an officer, how big a cadre would he be! And then today, two people come and tell me he's gone..." His eyes reddened. "Just like that, gone. How many in this village now? Never mind the ones with no family, the bachelors. But anyone with kin in the village—I can't look them in the eye! It was me who led everyone banging drums and gongs to send them off..."
