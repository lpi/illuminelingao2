# Chapter 2801 Father-in-law And Daughter

After another ten minutes of walking, they spotted a solitary "Five Phoenix" enclosed house standing stark against a small hillside in the distance. Chen Linhuang pointed toward it. "That's the East Estate."

"What a magnificent house." Zhang Laicai couldn't hide his surprise. This was clearly an "old house." Though Zhang Laicai spoke Fujian dialect, he was a native-born Lingao local and knew that families capable of building such residences in the old days were no ordinary folk.

"Father Fang was originally a landlord. This house is his ancestral property. It was renovated again two years ago when his daughter was seeking a husband to marry in."

A pond lay before the house, fronted by a vast, level drying yard. Both were relics of an earlier age. Just these two features alone proclaimed that the Fang ancestors had been wealthy people.

Zhang Youcai craned his neck, looking this way and that, clicking his tongue in admiration at the stone mill in the yard, the frame for tethering oxen, and the stacks of mats.

Those who had made their fortunes after the Senate's arrival were common enough in Lingao—one could say they were everywhere. But families that had accumulated such an estate under Great Ming rule were quite rare.

The main gate of the Five Phoenix House stood wide open. A middle-aged woman sat at the threshold doing needlework. Zhang Youcai called out:

"Sister-in-law Qinghe! Go fetch the Young Miss—people from the troops are here."

The woman called Sister-in-law Qinghe looked up, her face instantly flustered. She hurriedly set down her needlework and disappeared inside. Before long, a young woman emerged.

In terms of looks, she was unremarkable. But her attire remained in the style of the Great Ming from over a decade past, and even her hairstyle hadn't changed. Combined with this house, it gave the two men a momentary sense of displacement—a powerful feeling of having stepped back into the Great Ming era.

"This... you are..." Tan Shuangxi found himself tongue-tied, uncertain what to say.

The woman nodded silently. Though her face was pale, her expression remained calm.

Zhang Youcai saluted. "Miss... Fang, we are under orders to deliver the death notification and personal effects of Volunteer Soldier Hu Weide. Please accept our condolences." With that, he produced a kraft paper bag from his satchel.

Another recitation of the same rhetoric, routine business. Tan Shuangxi thought to himself.

The woman neither took the envelope nor spoke. Zhang Youcai proceeded through the content according to protocol: "...If you have any questions, you can write a letter or visit the Military Affairs Section of the County Civil Affairs Bureau for consultation..."

Before he could finish, several people entered from outside. Leading them was a robust man of about fifty, with graying hair and a square, stern face. He wore a faded indigo "labor suit," clutched a tattered straw hat in one hand, and had his trouser legs rolled up high—his calves and feet caked with mud.

He ladled several scoops of water from the jar by the door to rinse his feet before walking in.

"This is the head of the household," Chen Linhuang whispered, then addressed the newcomer: "Father! These two are comrades from the Fubo Army..."

"I have eyes; I can see." The newcomer gave a cold harrumph, his gaze sweeping over the Fang girl. "Why did you come out?"

The woman couldn't help but tremble. Tan Shuangxi recognized such scenes all too well—women and children beaten into fearfulness at home always wore that expression. He sighed inwardly. Before he could speak, the Fang girl whispered, "Two officers came on official business; someone from the family had to receive them..." She began rising to withdraw as she spoke.

"Miss Fang is Comrade Hu Weide's wife. This notification was meant to be delivered to her personally regardless. There is nothing improper about it." Tan Shuangxi had originally intended to avoid confrontation, but he couldn't restrain himself.

"Heh, putting on the airs of public officials." Old Man Fang smiled disdainfully, produced a cigarette, and a helper behind him immediately struck an Australian match to light it for him. He took a drag, swaggered over, settled into the central chair, and extended his hand with casual authority.

The Fang girl reacted as if electrocuted, hurriedly passing him the unopened envelope.

Tan Shuangxi felt uncomfortable all over. He and Zhang Laicai sat on benches, already "a level lower." Looking at Hu Weide's father-in-law with his domineering arrogance—not a shred of grief in those eyes—and then at the Fang girl's sorrowful gaze that dared not release its tears, a fire ignited in his chest. And this was supposed to be a Heaven and Earth Society model household!

Old Man Fang tore open the envelope and spilled its contents onto the table. He first picked up a document stamped with an official seal. "What's this?"

Chen Linhuang leaned over to look. "This is Ah Wei's death notification. I'll read it..."

Old Man Fang paid him no heed, tossing it aside carelessly. He snatched up another slip of paper and scrutinized it—clearly recognizing it as a check and understanding the numbers printed on it.

"Only eighty yuan?" The old man spoke with undisguised dissatisfaction. "Didn't they say six hundred yuan for a dead soldier before?!"

"That was before the currency reform. Five hundred and thirty yuan was in grain circulation vouchers; now it's in silver exchange vouchers. How much grain could one yuan buy in the past, and how much can it buy now? In real terms, the amount has actually increased significantly." Tan Shuangxi explained with patience he didn't feel.

Old Man Fang said nothing more. He picked up another list and shoved it into Chen Linhuang's hand. "Look at this—what is it?"

"It's a list of Ah Wei's personal effects," Chen Linhuang said. "One thick and one thin military blanket, two sets of service uniforms, one satchel..."

"Enough, enough—a pile of junk." Old Man Fang cut him off impatiently. "Where are the things?"

"They'll be mailed subsequently," Chen Linhuang said. "It's written right here."

"Just divide them among yourselves when they arrive."

Chen Linhuang looked alarmed. He glanced at the Fang girl and whispered, "Father, this isn't appropriate. Ah Wei's mementos should go to the Young Miss."

Chen Linhuang's voice was very low, but it still reached everyone's ears. The Fang girl could hold back no longer and began to sob quietly. The long-term laborers and women nearby all wore expressions of unbearable pity.

"What use are they to her?" Hu Weide's father-in-law snorted coldly. "She can't wear them, and just looking at them makes her cry. No Fulao is any good. I never should have married my daughter to him in the first place."

"Dad," his daughter finally spoke, "don't say such things. They came with good intentions to deliver the letter..."

"It's their errand—what good or bad intentions have anything to do with it?" Old Man Fang surveyed the items on the table, spotted another check, and snatched it up. "Seventy-three yuan, three dimes, four cents, one wen," he muttered, reading aloud, then turned to ask Chen Linhuang, "What money is this?"

Tan Shuangxi interjected quickly: "It's the military pay he saved up."

"Just this much?" Old Man Fang said. "I heard that going to war pays well. He was gone for over a year and a month, and this is all there is?"

Tan Shuangxi was indignant but forced himself to explain: "Sir! Comrade Hu Weide sacrificed himself over four months ago. He was deployed overseas for a total of only three months. So he didn't save much money."

"Don't try to fool me." The old man eyed the two NCOs up and down while clutching the check. "Doesn't issuing military pay come with details? Even factories give out... payrolls!"

"The standards for military pay and subsidies are determined by the Senate. The personal effects package contains his soldier's handbook and pay stubs; you can verify every item. If you have questions, please inquire at the Military Affairs Section of the County Civil Affairs Bureau." Having reached this point, Tan Shuangxi could bear it no longer and challenged him directly: "You... Hu Weide was your daughter's husband—half a son to you. Do you not care at all about how he died?"

"What difference does it make if I know? Can knowing bring him back to life?" The old man sneered. "The weather is so hot. Sorry to trouble you with making this trip."

"Hu Weide was our comrade-in-arms; of course we had to come." Tan Shuangxi was on the verge of explosion. What kind of attitude was this old wretch displaying?!

"So you came—so what? You still have to leave just the same..."

"Dad!" His daughter finally erupted, crying and shouting at the old man. "I'm begging you, stop talking!"

The old man's eyes bulged, and he opened his mouth to unleash his temper. But Tan Shuangxi could contain himself no longer. He shot to his feet, eyes blazing with fury as he glared at the old fellow. "We are delivering Comrade Hu Weide's personal effects to his widow by order of the Senate! Unrelated personnel, please conduct yourselves with dignity!"

He was battle-hardened. The aura of ferocity and courage honed on the battlefield erupted from him in that moment. The previously arrogant Old Man Fang opened his mouth to retort but wilted, not daring to speak again.

The Fang girl looked toward Tan Shuangxi. "When did my husband die? Did he suffer?"

Tan Shuangxi had been righteous and stern just moments ago, but facing the woman's grief-stricken gaze, he choked up. Zhang Laicai had to speak in his place, recounting the story they had agreed upon during their journey: "He caught miasma. The miasma in the forests of Liangguang is terribly poisonous. He had a high fever for several days... We took turns caring for him. The company medic tried several medicines. But this miasma was too fierce—we did everything we could. He woke for a moment before he died, said he wasn't uncomfortable, and said... the person he missed most was you."

Hu Weide's wife nodded as she listened, her head sinking lower and lower until she covered her face with both hands, her body wracked with convulsive sobs.

Old Man Fang, unwilling to be ignored, sneered: "When a man is about to die, his words turn kind. Just pretty talk to deceive people!"

"Where is he buried now?" The Fang girl ignored her father and asked.

"Comrade Hu Weide was cremated on site after his sacrifice. His ashes are now interred in the military cemetery in Chaozhou. The specific address is on the death notification."

At the word "cremated," the Fang girl could no longer contain herself. She wailed aloud.

Tan Shuangxi knew most people couldn't accept the concept of cremation, so he hastened to explain: "He sacrificed himself near Fujian. The weather was extremely hot and the roads were bad, so we had to act according to circumstances. If you wish to bring him back for burial later, you can submit an application..."

"Burned is burned—saves the trouble of bringing him back." The old fellow nodded, his tone dripping with sarcasm, a sound almost like laughter escaping at the end.

Tan Shuangxi wanted nothing more than to kick him, but seeing the wailing Fang girl, the fire in his heart died away. Hu Weide was dead, and his wife still had to live in this family. They were father and daughter after all—what could he possibly do?
