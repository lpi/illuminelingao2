# Chapter 2870: Private Secretary Xia (1)

Gao Ju's gaze slid toward Fu Bu'er. Seeing the wealthy local farmer wearing an expression of pure amusement, he shook his head inwardly while keeping his smile firmly in place. He raised his cup to the gathering: "Come, come—the tea is served. Let us continue enjoying the music. Today is for fellowship; let's not squander the Senate's kind hospitality."

A chorus of agreement rose around him. Strings and bamboo pipes struck up their melody, and delicate footsteps whispered beyond the beaded curtain—it seemed another act was about to begin.

"What's happening out there?"

At that moment, in a private room not far away, someone posed the question.

"Nothing of consequence. A gentleman from the exchange delegation had too much to drink and was harassing the service staff. The matter has been settled." The attendant who had stepped out to investigate had returned to report. "Also, Mister Xia has arrived and is waiting outside."

The man who had asked gave a slight nod, a trace of disdain crossing his features. Such incidents were hardly uncommon in Lingao. Under the Senate's rule, old-era habits frequently collided with new-era order, striking just such sparks. That the troublemaker happened to be a member of the exchange delegation—representatives of Guangzhou's "most progressive circles"—was somewhat reckless of him.

"You may withdraw," he said quietly.

The attendants filed out of the private room. The man glanced at the woman beside him, and the two rose and excused themselves without a word.

He picked up the teacup from the table, blew gently across the foam, and took a measured sip. The tea was fine black tea—its liquor red and luminous, its fragrance mellow and rich. This was excellent Fujian leaf, shipped to the Limu Mountain Tea Factory in Lingao for fermentation and processing. What they served here was the finest Premium Grade, available exclusively at Store 82.

Even the tea served to guests at Ziming Tower spoke of something extraordinary. Everything about this place proclaimed its distinction.

A light knock came at the door, and then it swung open. Xia Zhongde stepped inside, his face wearing the characteristic smile his kind assumed before important figures—deferential yet close, reverent yet slightly constrained.

The Xia Zhongde before him had shed his customary wide-sleeved robes and square scholar's headwrap, donning instead the "cadre clothes" commonly seen on local naturalized citizens—a grey uniform with a standing collar and four pockets. This attire had originally been exclusive to naturalized citizens, but nowadays it had become common enough in Lingao's streets and alleys, especially among commoners eager to embrace the new order. On him, however, the outfit had an incongruous quality.

The tailoring was well-fitted, the fabric visibly high-quality—not something ordinary people could afford. The problem lay with the man wearing it. As a Private Secretary, he was accustomed to being deferential to superiors and commanding with inferiors. But this cadre suit was designed to be crisp and smart, emphasizing a spirited, upright bearing. The squared shoulders formed a subtle contrast with his slightly hunched posture, making it seem as though the clothes were propping him up rather than the other way around.

His movements also appeared somewhat stiff. Still unaccustomed to the relatively tight sleeves and fitted waist, his arms swung up unconsciously when he bowed, carrying residual traces of the old-style clasped-hands greeting. Most amusing of all was his hair—apparently to conceal his topknot, he had put on a Store 82-style Panama straw hat. Yet the hair around the sides refused to gather neatly beneath it, lending him a somewhat comical appearance.

"Chief An..." he called out respectfully.

An Xi's gaze lingered on him for about a second longer than necessary. That brief stare made Xia Zhongde's smile freeze momentarily. Then An Xi resumed his normal expression and nodded slightly, indicating he should sit.

"Mister Xia's attire today is quite sharp." An Xi's tone was flat; one couldn't discern whether it was praise or something else entirely.

Xia Zhongde relaxed slightly and quickly took his seat, unconsciously reaching to smooth wide sleeves that weren't there. Halfway through the motion, he caught himself and awkwardly placed his hands on his knees, his posture stiff.

"When in Rome, do as the Romans do. The Senate has ushered in a new era. Though this humble one is slow-witted, I aspire to it as well, so I acquired a set to avoid... appearing too outdated."

An Xi understood. This incongruity revealed Xia Zhongde's true situation and mindset at this moment—he was eager to embrace the new order for the sake of survival and advancement, but the marks of the old era weren't so easily washed away with a mere change of clothes.

"Please, sit."

Xia Zhongde removed his hat, bowed slightly, and settled into his seat, wearing his customary, carefully measured smile.

"There was a small disturbance outside that disturbed the Chief's peace."

"No matter." An Xi set down his teacup, his gaze calm. "When a forest grows large, all manner of birds appear. Our enterprise is in its founding stage; our personnel come from complex backgrounds. Some old-era habits are unavoidable. The key is to understand and follow the rules." His remark seemed like casual commentary, yet also seemed to carry a pointed meaning.

Xia Zhongde nodded repeatedly: "The Chief speaks truly. Without rules, nothing can be achieved. Especially the law—it is the foundation upon which society operates." He smoothly steered the conversation toward the day's main theme. "Thanks to the Chief's guidance last time, those insights about 'retroactivity,' 'jurisdiction,' and 'completeness of the evidence chain' truly enlightened this humble one. After returning to report to my employer and proceeding according to the plan, the police did indeed cease pursuing that old case. Yesterday, the official notice of case dismissal arrived, and the bail money was fully refunded. Madam Qu is extremely grateful and specifically instructed me to convey her heartfelt thanks to the Chief."

An Xi smiled slightly without committing to anything. At the time, Master Qu hadn't even been in Lingao. Left at home were only women and children. Madam Qu, as the person in charge, had been summoned and held at the station for questioning—to whom exactly was Xia Zhongde supposed to have reported? Having been a Private Secretary for so long, especially one doing this kind of work, "caution" and "deflection" were deeply ingrained habits.

The case itself wasn't difficult. Years before the Qu family moved to Lingao, there had been a household matter involving two or three possible deaths. Under the Ming laws of that time, it had been handled as an ambiguous case. Under Senate rule, however, someone had reported it, and confessions were obtained from the parties involved. Madam Qu, as both the person in charge and a suspect, could hardly escape involvement. Xia Zhongde had found his way to An Xi through layers of connections to ask for assistance.

Given An Xi's current position, he ordinarily wouldn't trouble himself with such matters. As Secretary of the Law Society, his official title was Permanent Vice-Minister of the Ministry of Justice. Administrative agencies weren't the centers of power, yet they wielded the most power. Though his title wasn't as impressively grand as "Minister of Justice," "Chief Justice of the Supreme Court," or "Prosecutor General," he was the top administrative bureaucrat in his department.

He lacked neither money nor position—he had already reached the pinnacle of personal power. There truly wasn't much that could move him.

Out of certain considerations, he had ultimately decided to intervene. He hadn't directly interfered with the judiciary, however. He had merely offered some pointers "within the legal framework," highlighting the gray areas where old and new laws intersected, as well as possible flaws in the evidence-gathering procedures. For a law student who had been steeped in cases for years, attended countless discussions, and participated in the transcription-style legal compilation—even one with just "adult education credentials" in law—this had been effortless.

"Mister Xia flatters me too much," An Xi said evenly. "I didn't do anything. I merely offered some principled views based on current law. How matters are ultimately determined is the judiciary's affair. Senate law emphasizes evidence and procedure."

"Yes, yes, yes, the Chief is principled and speaks fairly." Xia Zhongde smiled in agreement, though his mind was clear as a mirror. The more lightly the other party dismissed it, the more enormous his influence appeared. For Senator An, it had perhaps been just a word or two; but for the Qu family, it had averted a disaster that could have ruined them entirely.

He couldn't say he had any deep feelings for the Qu family. But since he was doing work for them, he should at least prove worthy of their courtesy and payment over the years.

"As for the other case—Madam has also said: although Suniang did attempt premeditated harm against her, unsuccessfully, a life has been lost after all. She doesn't wish to pursue it further and has issued a letter of understanding. The follow-up matters for Nanny Han will be handled by the Qu family."

An Xi made no comment, merely nodding. But Xia Zhongde knew the other party was satisfied with this handling. The Zhou Suniang case—the sooner it was closed, the better.

He hurriedly produced a flat brocade box from within his sleeve and pushed it forward. "Senator An is self-restrained and incorruptible; ordinary gold and silver this humble one dare not use to sully your good name. This item was something my employer happened to acquire—a manuscript notebook belonging to an old retired official from the previous dynasty, one skilled in legal matters. It may contain some precedents regarding the handling of old legal cases in the Lingnan region. I thought it might be of slight reference value for Senator An's research into the evolution of laws past and present—a small token of regard. I humbly hope you will accept it."

An Xi's gaze lingered on the brocade box for a moment. Gold and silver treasures? He truly had no interest in them. What Senators lacked least were such things, and true power and resources weren't exchanged for with mere wealth. The manuscript, to be honest, didn't interest him either—fundamentally, he wasn't a person who loved or excelled at study. Otherwise, he wouldn't have been just a law student graduated from adult continuing education. But this gift... was interesting. Clearly, considerable thought had gone into it. This "thank-you gift" was neither vulgar nor off-target. Moreover, it hinted that the giver remembered his pretense of "legal research." After all, research into the dark corners of old-era justice was something of a prominent subject at the Law Society.

He didn't reach for it immediately. His fingertip tapped twice on the smooth tabletop, producing a light "tok tok" sound. "Mister Xia is too thoughtful." He began slowly. "Studying old law is for better implementing new law. For the Senate to establish an unprecedented new order in this land, a few hundred Senators alone aren't enough. More people need to understand, accept, and implement our ideals. The judiciary is an important avenue." He raised his eyes, his gaze sweeping almost casually over Xia Zhongde. "Mister Xia, you—familiar with the old ways yet able to read the signs of the times, also having studied the new laws—are truly rare talent."

Xia Zhongde's heart stirred. He straightened his back involuntarily, his smile widening even as a few degrees of caution crept into it: "The Chief praises too highly. This student failed the imperial examinations and only delved into litigation matters to make a living. Muddling through in the old dyeing vat, barely literate. That I'm able to make a living now is entirely thanks to the clear skies under the Senate's rule. The Chief and all the Senators are the pillars establishing this prosperous era. This humble one can only devote all effort, adapt to the times, and hope not to fail the grace of the Senate's enlightenment."
