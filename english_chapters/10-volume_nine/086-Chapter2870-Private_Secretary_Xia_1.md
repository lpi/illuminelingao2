# Chapter 2870: Private Secretary Xia (1)

Gao Ju's peripheral vision swept over Fu Bu'er. Seeing this local wealthy farmer's expression of watching a show, he secretly shook his head inwardly while still maintaining a smile on his face. He raised his cup toward everyone: "Come, come, come, the tea's been served. Let's continue listening to the tunes. Today is for fellowship; let's not waste the Senate's kind intentions."

Everyone agreed in a clamor. The sounds of strings and bamboo arose, and fine footsteps rustled outside the beaded curtain—it seemed another act had begun.

"What's happening out there?"

At this moment, in a private room not far away, someone asked.

"Nothing important. A gentleman from the exchange delegation had too much to drink and was harassing the service staff. It's been settled now." The attendant who had gone out to inquire came back to report. "Also, Mister Xia has arrived and is waiting outside."

The man who asked nodded, showing a hint of disdain. Such incidents weren't uncommon in Lingao. Under the Senate's rule, old-era bad habits often clashed with new-era order, producing such sparks. However, that the troublemaker was a member of the exchange delegation, representing Guangzhou's "most progressive group," was somewhat reckless.

He said quietly: "You may withdraw."

The attendants withdrew from the private room. The man glanced sideways at the woman beside him, and the two immediately rose and excused themselves.

He picked up the teacup on the table, gently blew away the foam, and took a sip. The tea was fine black tea, with a red, bright liquor and a mellow, rich fragrance. This was excellent Fujian tea, shipped to Lingao's "Limu Mountain Tea Factory" for fermentation and processing. What they used here was the finest Premium Grade, only available at Store 82.

Even the tea for entertaining guests at Ziming Tower showed something extraordinary. Everything demonstrated its "distinction."

The private room door was lightly knocked and then pushed open. Xia Zhongde walked in, his face wearing the characteristic smile of his type when facing important figures—close and reverent yet slightly constrained.

The Xia Zhongde before him had shed his usual wide-sleeved robes and square scarf headwrap, changing into a set of "cadre clothes" commonly seen on local naturalized citizens—a grey uniform with a standing collar and four pockets. This attire was originally only for naturalized citizens, but nowadays on the streets and alleys of Lingao, it wasn't uncommon among commoners eager to integrate into the new order. However, worn on him, the outfit had an incongruous quality.

The tailoring of the clothes was well-fitted, and the material was visibly high-quality—not something ordinary people could afford. The problem lay with the person wearing the clothes. As a Private Secretary, he was accustomed to being deferential to superiors and controlling with inferiors. Yet this cadre suit was designed to be crisp and smart, emphasizing a spirited, upright bearing. The squared shoulders formed a subtle contrast with his slightly hunched posture, making him look as though the clothes were propping him up.

His movements also seemed somewhat stiff. As if still unused to the relatively tight sleeves and waist, his arms unconsciously swung up when he bowed, carrying residual traces of the old-style clasped-hands greeting. Most amusing of all was his hair—apparently to conceal his topknot, he had put on a "Store 82-style" Panama straw hat. Yet he couldn't gather all the hair around the sides into it, making him look somewhat comical.

"Chief An..." He called out respectfully.

An Xi's gaze lingered on him for about a second longer. This brief stare made Xia Zhongde's smile freeze momentarily. Then An Xi resumed his normal expression, nodding slightly to indicate he should take a seat.

"Mister Xia's attire today is quite smart." An Xi's tone was flat; one couldn't tell if it was praise or something else.

Xia Zhongde relaxed slightly and quickly sat down, unconsciously reaching to smooth the wide sleeves that weren't there. Halfway through the motion, he realized his mistake and awkwardly placed his hands on his knees, his posture somewhat stiff.

"When in Rome, do as the Romans do. The Senate has opened a new era. Though this humble one is dull, I aspire to it as well, so I acquired a set to avoid... appearing too outdated."

An Xi understood. This incongruity precisely revealed Xia Zhongde's true situation and mindset at this moment—he was eager to embrace the new order for survival and advancement, but the marks of the old era weren't so easily washed away with just a change of clothes.

"Please sit."

Xia Zhongde removed his hat, bowed slightly, and took a seat, wearing his customary, appropriately measured smile.

"There was a small disturbance outside that disturbed the Chief's peace."

"No matter." An Xi set down his teacup, his gaze calm. "With a big forest, all kinds of birds appear. Our enterprise is in its founding stage; personnel come from complex backgrounds. Some old-era habits are unavoidable. The key is to understand and follow the rules." His remark seemed like casual commentary yet also seemed to carry a pointed meaning.

Xia Zhongde nodded repeatedly: "The Chief speaks truly. Without rules, nothing can be achieved. Especially the law—it's the foundation that maintains society's operation." He smoothly steered the topic toward today's main theme. "Thanks to the Chief's guidance last time, those insights about 'retroactivity,' 'jurisdiction,' and 'completeness of the evidence chain' truly enlightened this humble one. After returning and reporting to my employer and proceeding according to the plan, the police indeed stopped pursuing that old case. Yesterday, the official notice of case dismissal was sent over, and the bail money was fully refunded. Madam Qu is extremely grateful and specifically instructed me to express heartfelt thanks to the Chief."

An Xi smiled slightly without committing. At the time, Master Qu wasn't even in Lingao. Left at home were only women and children. Madam Qu, the person in charge, had been summoned and held at the station for questioning—to whom was he supposed to report? Having been a Private Secretary for so long, especially one doing this kind of work, "caution" and "deflection" were deeply ingrained.

The case wasn't difficult. Years before the Qu family moved to Lingao, there had been a household matter that involved two or three possible deaths. Under the Ming laws at the time, it had been a muddled case. Under Senate rule, someone had reported it, and confessions were obtained from the parties involved. Madam Qu, as the person in charge and a suspect, was hard-pressed to escape involvement. Xia Zhongde had found him through layers of connections to ask for help in this matter.

Given An Xi's current position, he ordinarily wouldn't bother with such things. As Secretary of the Law Society, his official position was Permanent Vice-Minister of the Ministry of Justice. Administrative agencies weren't power centers, yet they had the most power. Though his title wasn't as impressively grand as "Minister of Justice," "Chief Justice of the Supreme Court," or "Prosecutor General," he was the top administrative bureaucrat in his department.

He lacked neither money nor position—he had already reached the pinnacle of personal power. There really wasn't much that could move him.

Out of certain considerations, he ultimately decided to intervene in this matter. However, he didn't directly interfere with the judiciary. He merely offered some pointers "within the legal framework," pointing out the gray areas where old and new laws intersected, as well as possible flaws in the evidence-gathering procedures. For a law student who had been steeped in various cases over the years, attended countless discussions, and participated in the transcription-style legal compilation—even one with just "adult education credentials" in law—this was effortless.

"Mister Xia flatters me too much," An Xi said flatly. "I didn't do anything. I merely offered some principled views based on current law. How to ultimately determine things is the judiciary's affair. Senate law emphasizes evidence and procedure."

"Yes, yes, yes, the Chief is principled and speaks fairly." Xia Zhongde smiled in agreement, though his mind was clear as a mirror. The more lightly the other party put it, the more enormous his influence appeared. For this Senator An, it was perhaps just a word or two; but for the Qu family, it had averted a disaster that could have ruined the family.

He couldn't say he had any deep feelings for the Qu family. But since he was doing work for them, he should at least be worthy of the Qu family's courtesy and payment over the years.

"The other case—Madam has also said: Although Suniang did attempt premeditated harm against her unsuccessfully, a life has been lost after all. She doesn't wish to pursue it further and has issued a letter of understanding. The follow-up matters for Nanny Han will be handled by the Qu family."

An Xi made no comment, just nodded. But Xia Zhongde knew the other party was satisfied with this handling. The Zhou Suniang case—the sooner it was closed, the better.

He hurriedly took out a flat brocade box from his sleeve and pushed it forward. "Senator An is self-restrained and incorruptible; ordinary gold and silver this humble one dare not use to sully your good name. This item was something my employer happened to acquire—a manuscript notebook of an old retired official skilled in legal matters from the previous dynasty. It may contain some precedents regarding the handling of old legal cases in the Lingnan region. I thought it might be of slight reference value to Senator An's research into the evolution of laws past and present—a small token of regard. I humbly hope you will accept it."

An Xi's gaze lingered on the brocade box for a moment. Gold and silver treasures? He truly had no interest in them. What Senators lacked least was such things; and true power and resources weren't exchanged for with those. This manuscript, to be honest, didn't interest him either—fundamentally, he wasn't a person who loved or was good at studying. Otherwise, he wouldn't be just a law student graduated from adult continuing education. But this gift... was interesting. Clearly, much thought had gone into it. This "thank-you gift" was neither vulgar nor off-target. Moreover, it hinted that the giver remembered his pretense of "legal research." After all, research into the dark corners of old-era justice was something of a prominent subject at the Law Society.

He didn't immediately reach for it. His fingertip tapped twice on the smooth tabletop, making a light "tok tok" sound. "Mister Xia is too thoughtful." He began slowly. "Studying old law is for better implementing new law. For the Senate to establish an unprecedented new order in this land, a few hundred Senators alone aren't enough. More people need to understand, accept, and implement our ideals. The judiciary is an important avenue." He raised his eyes, his gaze seemingly casually sweeping over Xia Zhongde. "Mister Xia, you—familiar with the old ways yet able to read the signs of the times, also having studied the new laws—are truly rare talent."

Xia Zhongde's heart stirred. He involuntarily straightened his back a bit, his smile growing while also adding a few degrees of caution: "The Chief praises too highly. This student failed the imperial examinations and only delved into litigation matters to make a living. Muddling through in the old dyeing vat, barely literate. Being able to make a living now is entirely thanks to the clear skies under the Senate's rule. The Chief and all the Senators are the pillars establishing this prosperous era. This humble one can only devote all effort, adapt to the times, and hope not to fail the grace of the Senate's enlightenment."
