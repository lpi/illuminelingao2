# Chapter 2785: The Capital (Part 141)

"Stop chattering, I'll let you have three wen today!" The middle-aged scholar yelled loudly. Strangely, he spoke with full vital energy now, sweeping away the listless fatigue when reading the newspaper. "You must open your eyes and see clearly. These three wen coins are Gold Back Big Coins, good quality of four-fire brass, much more sufficient in value than your lousy tea soup!" After speaking, he threw the copper coins on the table, picked up the book satchel and big hat, and left with his head held high.

About a shichen (two hours) later, the young Tribute Student finished copying the newspaper, settled the tea money, and left the tea house. The snow stopped now. The afternoon sun pierced through the dense lead-colored cloud layer with a few beams of light. He untied the mule tied beside the shop door, rode on it, and walked along the muddy street churning with slush to the book market outside Great Ming Gate. After wandering in numerous book shops for a while, he turned to the Southern City, walked all the way to Damochang Street, stopping occasionally to stroll in various book shops and antique shops. Finally, he stopped beside a paper shop named "Pine and Bamboo Studio" (Song Zhu Zhai), tied the mule in front of the door, and walked in.

This paper shop's frontage was not large. Windows imitated certain trendy rich households and big business firms in the Capital, using wooden window lattices inlaid with small pieces of glass. The natural light penetrating inside illuminated the calligraphy and paintings hanging on the four walls. Paper stationery, account books, and scholar's objects displayed inside the glass counter appeared quite elegant. A shop assistant had already come forward to welcome him: "Does this gentleman want to use paper? Wonder if it's for painting (Danqing) or practicing calligraphy (Linchi)? This small shop has slightly prepared Kaihua Rattan Paper, Jingxian Lian-Si Paper, Songjiang Tan Stationery. If used for correspondence, there are also Xue Tao Stationery, Suzhou Gold-Flecked Paper. If you want to write scriptures, our shop has self-made Magnetic Blue Paper (Ciqing Zhi). Although not as good as Xuande Sheep Brain Stationery, it's not far from it..."

"I sent a painting to your studio for mounting last month," The young man asked, "Is it done?"

"Oh, it turns out to be Young Master Li. Please forgive this lowly one's clumsy eyes, disrespect," The shop assistant lifted the back door curtain, "The painting is naturally mounted well. Please move your steps to the back hall to see."

The back room of the shop hall was a flower hall for entertaining honored guests, also equipped with glass window lattices, appearing bright, elegant, and clean. The shop assistant didn't stop here but led "Young Master Li" through the winding corridor along the side wall straight to the back. The second-entrance courtyard had been transformed into a workshop. Works like mounting calligraphy and paintings, binding ancient books, and printing and dyeing paper stationery were all operated here. Craftsmen came and went, very lively. But once arriving at the third-entrance courtyard, it became deserted. Different from the front courtyard buildings, all windows of houses in this courtyard were pasted tightly with black felt paper, letting out not half a bit of light. Two guards stood in front of the door where the winding corridor led to the third-entrance courtyard. The shop assistant stopped here: "Li Ya has come."

A guard turned inside to report, and soon led "Young Master Li" into a study in the rear verify building (Hou Zhao Fang). In this room, an Australian-style cast iron fireplace was placed against the wall. The light emitted by the coal fire in the hearth plus the kerosene lamp on the desk illuminated a man wearing a Three-Shuttle Fine Cloth Taoist Robe and a hairnet, who was sitting by the desk reading a roll of documents.

Even if Lin Baiguang came to this room, it would be difficult for him to recognize his first disciple immediately. Long-term lurking life in the Great Ming jurisdiction made Gao Di "Great Ming-i-fied" at least in clothing, appearance, and gestures. The incident of Leng Ningyun caused Delong's cover identity as the Capital Intelligence Station to be completely compromised, implicating He Lian Sheng Bodyguard Agency to be half-exposed in the open. Seeing the danger of complete paralysis of intelligence work in the Capital, the Foreign Intelligence Bureau drastically adjusted the intelligence network in the Capital. Firms like He Lian Sheng and Delong completely withdrew from the intelligence work sequence, only responsible for "making money" and providing "support" when necessary. All intelligence collection work was taken over by a specialized intelligence network.

The backup Capital intelligence point urgently activated in this network was exactly the "Pine and Bamboo Studio" paper shop. After the Leng Ningyun incident, the Senate determined that stationing Senators in Beijing with extremely high danger was not worth the loss. However, the intelligence of the Capital was vital and at least had to be responsible by a high-ranking naturalized citizen cadre. Therefore, Gao Di was transferred to Beijing to sit in Pine and Bamboo Studio, becoming the general person in charge of the entire underground network in the Capital.

Although Gao Di was a Cantonese, he had worked for the intelligence department for a long time and received professional training, able to speak quite standard Mandarin. As for the slightly Cantonese accent, it was not too big a problem. The Capital itself was a place where people from five directions mixed. There were also quite a few Cantonese people serving as officials, studying, or doing business locally.

The new Capital Station adopted two ways to collect intelligence. Besides continuing to develop underground informants; the other was to utilize the paper shop business of "Pine and Bamboo Studio," trying to connect with eunuchs in the Inner Court to acquire waste paper from the Forbidden City. Inside, there was no lack of a considerable number of copies and transcripts of memorials and edicts. Intelligence personnel had to pan out "gold" from this pile of "sand." What Gao Di was flipping through were two pieces of "gold" just panned out. One was a copy of an Imperial Edict: ordering Zheng Hongkui (Zheng Zhifeng), who was granted the hereditary title of Jinyiwei Thousand Households and was a Military Jinshi of the Dingchou Year, to enter the Palace for answering questions; the other was a placard issued to the Ministers of Six Ministries and Supervising Secretaries of Six Offices of Scrutiny in early February, preparing to hold a court conference on the matter of sending troops to punish Kun. However, finding gold in sand had too much contingency after all. Records of answering questions, the process and conclusion of the court conference... not a word or phrase could be found in the waste paper. Just as Gao Di was hesitating about this, Li Ya came.

He took the *Peking Gazette* from Li Ya's hand, flipped through it slightly, and took out a few pages of paper clipped inside. But he wasn't in a hurry to open and read them. Instead, he asked: "You saw 'Qingcheng' (Green City). Any situation?"

Li Ya's Fujian Mandarin turned into authentic Australian New Language at this time. He briefly talked about the contact situation in the morning: "'Qingcheng' hinted to me at the end, demanding an increase in allowance."

"How much does he want?"

"Add another ten taels every month. Wants Shanxi tickets (bank drafts)."

Gao Di's eyebrows raised slightly. This fellow really opened his mouth like a lion! For clerks in the Six Ministries, monthly salary plus food allowance was only three or four taels of silver. He opened his mouth to ask for an addition of ten taels!

"Thinking quite nicely. That depends on how heavy the intelligence this fellow provides is."

Li Ya hesitated for a while but still told his superior his thoughts: "According to my observation, 'Qingcheng' seems to be drinking a certain medicinal wine. The smell and color of the wine are very similar to the Energy Agent I saw during the joint training of the Political Security Bureau. No matter what channel he used to get it, it definitely cost a lot of silver. I think his sudden demand for more allowance is mostly related to this thing."

"This possibility exists," Gao Di said, "You understand 'Qingcheng's identity, right? This person is a Juren of Shuntian Prefecture, but failed the Metropolitan Examination for many years. Later he was recruited as a Drafter of the Central Secretariat (Zhongshu Sheren). Although it is a position of high status and leisure (Qing Gui), there is absolutely no oil and water (illicit profit) to scoop. And not being from a Jinshi background, there is no hope for promotion and transfer. So he often has a feeling of depression and injustice. Such a person tends to seek novel enjoyments to anesthetize himself. Next time you contact him, see if the timing is right, you can inquire about the news of the medicinal wine. Be careful not to appear too deliberate, don't arouse his alertness."

After sending Li Ya away, Gao Di opened the paper pages, which were densely written with small regular script like fly heads. By the kerosene lamp fire, he couldn't help reading out loud softly: "Minister of Revenue official Cheng Guoxiang et al respectfully submit, regarding the conference of the Ministry of War on suppressing Kun and raising provisions..." He read it repeatedly several times, then picked up another piece of paper to read: "Right Assistant Censor-in-Chief, Vice Minister of War Xie Wenjin respectfully publishes regarding discussion of suppressing Kun..."

He twisted the mustache gradually grown in recent years while reading, gradually falling into deep thought.

Since "Daoist Lushi" (Hearth Stone) and "Daoist Mushi" (Wood Stone) fell into the net successively, the Shi Weng group suffered a heavy blow. Although Gao Di didn't know how much useful intelligence the Political Security Bureau could get from their mouths, Wang Yehao was no longer the number one enemy of the Senate in the future.

But Wang Yehao himself seemed not to have suffered too great a blow. Judging from intelligence sent from various channels, although Wang Yehao was panic-stricken and once depressed in will after the incident, he soon became active frequently again.

It was just that the main scope of his activities now had nothing to do with "Kun Thieves." Instead, he was actively seeking transfer.

Capital officials seeking external posts was not rare, but the place he sought was Shandong.

Governor of Shandong certainly was a "Big Official," but right now it really couldn't count as a "lucrative assignment." Let alone that Shandong was originally not a wealthy place, just for now, even the word "Peace" couldn't be mentioned. Large and small roving bandits and local bandits rose one after another within the border; drought and locusts continued; folk religious sects like White Lotus Society were itching to make trouble... and there was the errand of coordinating with Deng-Lai (Dengzhou and Laizhou) to support Liaodong. It could be said to integrate complexity, difficulty, fatigue, and conflict into one. It couldn't help but make Gao Di suspect his intention was the Shandong Station in the Deng-Lai area.

Speaking of which, judging from the direction of recent court discussions, there indeed seemed to be the possibility of "punishing Kun." Once the punitive expedition rose, the New Army compiled and trained by Governor of Deng-Lai Sun Yuanhua, which established war merits repeatedly recently, would inevitably be the object of being transferred south. Wang Yehao sticking a foot in with his rich anti-Kun experience was not impossible.

However, the intelligence collected by the intelligence network had quite a few self-contradictory places. From the intelligence collected from the Inner Court, the Emperor had quite an intention for peace talks, but the Outer Court was all shouting for "suppression" with killing cries. The Court also issued multiple decrees for war preparation successively. No matter how one looked, there was the intention of "suppression."

Combined with the secret struggle between the Restoration Society (Fushe) and Wen Tiren recently, the entire court situation was quite chaotic.

Finally, he shook the bell to let the guard outside the door call the nominal landlady of Pine and Bamboo Studio, He Chun, a cadre borrowed by the Foreign Intelligence Bureau from the Political Security Bureau.

Gao Di picked up the intelligence sent by Li Ya: "These materials must be sent to Lingao today."

"Send full text?" He Chun flipped through the paper pages, "Content is quite a lot; decoding will take a lot of time. How about this, I'll go help the telegraph operator Little Wang, strive to finish sending all before dawn."

"Thanks for your hard work. Besides, starting from next month, raise the allowance for 'Qingcheng' to fifty taels. This needs to be entered into the account."

"For outer line work, you decide." He Chun said.

"There is another very important matter. Go verify the quantity of Energy Agent in storage, and also the Anesthetic in the infirmary." Seeing He Chun's eyes widen, Gao Di waved his hand, signaling her not to be surprised: "Of course I trust my own comrades. But now news from several different sources indicate that various anesthetics are circulating in the Capital area. Some may be relatively close to the controlled drugs produced by the Senate. Combined with the current military movements of the Ming Court, I suspect someone plans to provide drugs to the Ming Army to counter the firearm advantage of the Senate. In short, a war is about to be fought."
