# Chapter 2807 Daya Village

"More young men off to be soldiers." Zhang Laicai returned to the private room, sighing with emotion.

"Someone has to go, don't they?" Tan Shuangxi said. "This splendid, colorful world—doesn't someone have to watch over it?"

Zhang Laicai said nothing. He lit a cigarette and slowly blew smoke rings. Tan Shuangxi, bored out of his mind, casually picked up the day's new issue of the *Lingao Times* from beside the table and flipped through it idly. Suddenly, his eyes widened, and he nudged Zhang Laicai's arm.

"Look at this!"

Zhang Laicai startled and almost dropped the cigarette butt on his arm. Thinking there was some urgent news, he hurriedly stubbed out the butt and leaned over.

"What news?!"

What he saw, however, was the literary section of the *Lingao Times*—though they usually enjoyed reading the newspaper, they typically skipped the literary section.

"What is this..."

"Look at this!" Tan Shuangxi pointed at a small block at the end of the literary section.

Zhang Laicai focused and saw it was a poem signed by Tan Haonan.

"Because I truly like her, I want to share all beautiful things with her. Setting aside love, simply liking someone also makes you want to share the beauty you feel with her. For example, the moon tonight is truly beautiful, and the wind is gentle too."

When Tan Shuangxi woke, his head still felt like it was splitting. After drinking a big bowl of hot water and lying wrapped in his blanket on the bed for a while longer, he finally felt a bit better. The sun was already high; he hadn't heard the broadcast time signal and estimated it was already past nine. Zhang Laicai hadn't returned yet—a moment of spring night is worth a thousand gold pieces, that kid probably wouldn't be back at the inn until noon.

After dinner yesterday, Zhang Laicai had left. With nothing to do by himself, he continued drinking to drown his sorrows. The beer ran out and wasn't satisfying enough, so he ordered fruit brandy. By the time he realized how late it was, he could no longer stand steadily.

Fortunately, not far from the restaurant was an inn with a "Military Designated" sign. The restaurant owner, afraid he might cause trouble drunk, sent two shop hands to escort him to the inn and check him in.

Just as his head was aching, Zhang Laicai found him.

"So here's where you were hiding." Zhang Laicai was beaming. "I had to ask the restaurant owner before I found out."

"He sent me here." Tan Shuangxi waved his hand weakly. "Really a good person..."

"A serving of stewed sheep testicles cost us fifteen cents; of course, they have to serve you well." Seeing Tan Shuangxi's haggard appearance, Zhang Laicai said, "Uncomfortable from drinking too much? You don't usually drink much; downing that much suddenly does this."

"Never again," Tan Shuangxi muttered.

Zhang Laicai, on the other hand, was full of energy. Seeing Tan Shuangxi looking sickly, he got him water to wash his face and went outside to buy him porridge. The camaraderie they hadn't built over years of serving together had somehow solidified during these few days of their mission.

"The last one is a platoon leader." Zhang Laicai sat at the dining table watching Tan Shuangxi drink porridge while flipping through the mission documents.

"Platoon leader." Tan Shuangxi said unconsciously.

Li Anze was the platoon leader of his platoon. It was precisely because of Li Anze's death in action that he had become the "Senior Sergeant" of the platoon. Speaking of connections, they ran deep. Tan Shuangxi's entire journey from an ordinary soldier at the start of the campaign to "Senior Sergeant" and acting platoon leader—none of it would have been possible without this officer's guidance. Although Li Anze was much younger than Tan Shuangxi, in Tan Shuangxi's eyes, this graduate of the Jeju Island Army School was like a father or elder brother to him.

"Such a pity. Lieutenant Li originally had a boundless future," Zhang Laicai said with much regret. "Look, those who die are all the talented ones."

Li Anze was a true "academy-bred" military cadre. After graduating from senior primary school, he was admitted to the Jeju Island Army School and was a graduate of the first two-year infantry program. Compared to the past "Military and Political Cadre Schools" that lasted three months, six months, or at most a year, this batch of graduates not only had higher cultural levels but, due to extended professional training, possessed first-rate military aptitude. The Senator officers valued them highly; all were targets for priority cultivation.

Tan Shuangxi said solemnly, "He was my benefactor."

"That's right. If not for him, you'd have been dead long ago."

This touched on a past incident. Back when pursuing Ming troops, during a night march, Tan Shuangxi's platoon was assigned to the battalion's collection duty, specifically recovering straggling soldiers. The night was dark and the road slippery; he slipped and fell into a mountain gully, losing consciousness.

When he woke, the unit had already passed. He was bleeding from a head wound and had twisted his ankle. Lying alone in the gully's undergrowth, surrounded by wilderness—crying to heaven brought no answer, calling to earth brought no response. He could only sit and await death. But unexpectedly, Platoon Leader Li Anze discovered him missing during the morning roll call. While the unit rested, he led men back at the risk of being attacked by stragglers and bandits, walking nearly twenty *li* on mountain paths to rescue him.

"If not for him, not only would my bones have been lost without a trace, but most likely my file would be stamped with an inexplicable 'Missing' seal." Tan Shuangxi said with emotion.

"He was from your hometown, right?"

"He and my grandmother were from the same village," Tan Shuangxi said. "The Li family were the village carpenters. His father was skilled; he worked outside all year round and always brought back a good amount of money and rice at year's end. Their life was better than most in the village. That's why he could study and learn to read."

After breakfast, the two set off. The Daya Village where Li Anze's family lived was a bit far from the urban rail. It was a coastal village; they could either take the coastal transport boat from Bopu or take the rural route's public coach. To save time, they decided to take the coach.

Unexpectedly, at the Bairen Transport Center, Tan Shuangxi ran into an acquaintance—a villager from Daya Village who had come to Bairen to deliver goods and was now heading back after unloading. So the two hitched a ride on his cargo coach.

Once aboard, the wide carriage was more than half loaded. Judging from the packaging, it was all daily consumer goods: liquor, fabric, soap... There were also farm tools, fishing gear, and hardware materials.

Watching fields recede on both sides of the road, the route to Daya Village was average. The gravel surface was fairly level, but the foundation was thin, often encountering significant potholes that made the whole coach jolt continuously.

"Sorry about this—this is a cargo vehicle." The driver called out a greeting. "The suspension's a bit rough. Not as comfortable as a passenger coach!"

"No problem, having a ride is good enough." Tan Shuangxi handed the driver a cigarette and started chatting idly, hoping to distract himself and ease the discomfort from his hangover.

"The road isn't very good?"

"Built with pooled funds—how good can it get?" The driver smoked and chattered on. This road wasn't considered an "official highway" but rather built with money and labor contributed by Daya Village and several villages along the way. However, since it was the first time private funds were pooled to build a road, the county's Civil Affairs Section gave a small subsidy and sent a technician for free to survey and design. So the road's specifications followed Australian style—it just didn't have big machines to compact the foundation, and the materials were substandard. A few months after completion, it started deteriorating.

"...These two years, we patch it when it breaks. We patch slower than it breaks," the driver said. "Well, how many vehicles pass on this road every day? Strange if it didn't get worn down."

Daya Village and several coastal villages used this road to sell their catches to Chengmai County seat and Maniao Fort. While villages not on the coast used this road to sell vegetables and poultry. Whether the old county seat or Bopu, Bairen, Jialai... these emerging towns' giant appetites seemed never to be satisfied. Cargo coaches flowed endlessly along the road, transporting agricultural and fishing products and bringing back industrial goods from town.

"It's really different from before." He gazed at the scenery along the way and sighed.

He hadn't been to Daya Village for a long time. As a child, he loved accompanying his mother back to her maiden home. As he grew older, he went less often. The family was poor, and his mother wasn't enthusiastic about visiting her maiden home either. After all, life at her maiden home wasn't easy either. Dragging children along meant face-saving hospitality became "reluctant": grandmother's worry beneath her happy expression, uncle's slightly awkward "welcome," and aunt's undisguised disgust. Although due to kinship they still visited occasionally, visits became fewer and fewer.

Later, when grandmother passed away, he hurried back to Daya Village with his mother for the funeral. In a flash, several more years had passed.

"Now there are ten times more people than before." The driver said. "All northerners. If you speak the local dialect in the village now, eight out of ten won't understand. Everyone can only speak New Speech now."

"Everyone understands New Speech; there's nothing bad about that."

"True, nothing bad. But the children can't speak it anymore..." The driver seemed to have some complaints, but he couldn't articulate what harm there was in children not speaking it either. He just sighed helplessly.

On one side of the road, the terrain opened up into vast coastal mudflats. Near the road, grass and shrubs grew thick. On the mudflats, flocks of ducks foraged.

Tan Shuangxi knew this was "mudflat duck farming." Raising ducks this way not only saved feed but also produced more eggs of better quality. These were the so-called "sea duck eggs."

"So many ducks!" Zhang Laicai stood up to gaze at the massive flocks constantly forming various formations on the mudflat, exclaiming in surprise.

"This isn't many," the driver said. "Just a small part. Now many households in the village are raising ducks; fewer go out to fish instead."

"Oh? Why not go?" Tan Shuangxi was somewhat puzzled.

"Fishing takes more capital now. You need big boats, Australian-style big boats at that. Fishing gear isn't cheap either, and you have to buy ice... As for making money, fishing earns more than before, but the capital—ordinary people can't afford it. Besides, big boats for fishing save manpower; what do the extra people do? They have to find other livelihoods. The Heaven and Earth Society sent people to promote duck-raising, saying we have lots of mudflats here. So the village started raising ducks. Selling eggs to the food factory at least earns enough to keep the family fed."

"That's fine too. Going out to sea to fish is hard work after all," Tan Shuangxi said sincerely.
