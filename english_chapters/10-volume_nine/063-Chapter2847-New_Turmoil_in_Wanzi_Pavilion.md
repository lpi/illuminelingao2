# Chapter 2847: New Turmoil at Wanzi Pavilion

It was rather ironic that the bag in Zhou Suniang's hand, reportedly made of meticulously stitched "dragon" (crocodile) skin, was worth more than a year's income for an ordinary naturalized worker. Inside, the vanity case, comb, lipstick, and eyebrow pencil... any single item would cover a month or even several months of expenses for an ordinary family. Yet, she had no money.

The Qu family always bought on credit at the "established" shops. For places that did not accept credit, a steward would follow to settle the bill. As a "mistress," she never carried money herself.

The money she had spent on the way from her residence to the City Rail station had come from the two yuan of monthly pocket money she had managed to save. Two yuan a month was roughly the monthly income of an entry-level local employee, but in a wealthy household like the Qu family, such a trivial sum really didn't amount to much.

However, the two yuan and change she had carefully calculated for her expenses had been picked from her pocket when she boarded the City Rail. Zhou Suniang usually went out with a retinue of servants and maids, at least two or three people accompanying her. Lingao was outwardly a very peaceful and prosperous place, which had lowered her guard. Moreover, her attire was simply too conspicuous.

Fortunately, a conductor passed by at that moment, and she learned she needed to get off at Bairen East. Bairen East was not far from Wanzi Pavilion, so there was no need to hire a carriage.

Hearing this news, she finally breathed a sigh of relief. As long as she reached Wanzi Pavilion, everything would be fine. She could simply borrow a yuan or two from the counter.

The City Rail arrived at Bairen East, and Zhou Suniang disembarked. She was relatively familiar with the street scene here and quickly recognized the direction to Wanzi Pavilion.

It was actually less than half a *li* from the station to the shop, but for a woman with "liberated feet" like Zhou Suniang—feet that had been bound and then released—walking this distance was quite strenuous.

Bairen East was a bustling station. Aside from the time she had followed the Master and Madam on the City Rail shortly after arriving in Lingao to "experience Australian luxury," this was her first time riding the City Rail alone, and her first time arriving at Bairen East station by herself.

The square in front of the red brick station building was teeming with people. Peddlers wearing "Licensed Operation" badges on their chests were hawking food and miscellaneous goods. Zhou Suniang had come to Bairen many times in the past, but usually, she had hurried past in a carriage or rickshaw. The lively market scene before her eyes made her both delighted and vaguely afraid—after all, her money had just been stolen.

She stood at the exit of the Bairen East City Rail station, her heart filled with mixed emotions. Her hand unconsciously touched her handbag, where the one yuan and change she had carefully calculated should have been, but now there was only cold air. She took a deep breath, trying to calm the unease in her heart, but the noise of the square made her even more agitated.

Her gaze wandered through the crowd, trying to find a trace of familiarity, but all she saw were strange faces. The hawking of vendors, the laughter of children, and the conversation of pedestrians interviewed to form a lively urban tapestry. Zhou Suniang felt as if she were being swept into a giant vortex, irresistibly pushed toward an unknown destiny.

Her feet moved involuntarily toward Wanzi Pavilion, each step feeling exceptionally heavy. Her "liberated feet" seemed somewhat out of place in this era; every step felt like a farewell to her past. Although her clothes were magnificent, she looked strikingly incongruous in the crowd, attracting many curious gazes.

A nameless fear welled up in Zhou Suniang's heart. She quickened her pace, but her footing became increasingly unsteady, as if she might fall at any moment.

On the west side of the square stood a gate-like frame. Locked to it were pickpockets and thieves caught at the station and surrounding areas—these "minor offenders." After being sentenced by the Public Order Court, they were publicly whipped in the square and then locked here for public display. Men and women of various appearances squatted or sat under the frame, their expressions diverse. To Zhou Suniang, these people seemed no different from wild beasts.

She tried to walk faster, leaving this noisy and crowded place behind.

Finally, Wanzi Pavilion was not far from the Bairen East station. After walking a short distance along the street, she saw its storefront, sandwiched between two large shops. It was unassuming; one might easily miss the "Wanzi Pavilion" signboard if not paying attention.

The moment she pushed open the spring door, she felt a wave of coolness. The heat and anxiety that had filled her body and mind instantly faded, and her steps steadied.

"Zhou Suniang is here?" He Xiaoyue was surprised.

"That's right, it's her!" Guo Xi'er nodded repeatedly.

"But she didn't make an appointment, and she hasn't ordered any clothes in the last two months..." He Xiaoyue said. "Is she here to rest her feet?"

Wealthy women who were regular customers did indeed have the habit of stopping by Wanzi Pavilion to rest and drink a cup of tea when they were tired from shopping.

"I'm telling you, it's a big deal!" Guo Xi'er lowered her voice and leaned into her ear.

"She's run away?!" He Xiaoyue, having served as a women's cadre for a long time, naturally thought of this. Although she had changed professions, she had seen cases of wives and concubines from wealthy families running away several times. As a women's cadre, she had even participated in the aftermath. Since joining Wanzi Pavilion, she had heard of similar incidents. Take the Qu family where Zhou Suniang lived, for instance; not long ago, someone had run away, causing quite a stir for a while.

If she were still a women's cadre, He Xiaoyue would naturally think "Good run," "Wonderful run," "Run until the masters scream." But right now, she was a designer at Wanzi Pavilion, and her primary concern was "business."

It didn't matter if Zhou Suniang ran away, but if she got Wanzi Pavilion involved, they could forget about doing business with the Qu family in the future. This would be a huge loss for her. After all, the female members of the Qu family particularly appreciated her designs and were currently her biggest clients. He Xiaoyue still remembered how An Jiu had helped Sister Lian run away, angering the Qu family and causing her father's Ruihexiang shop to lose a major client.

"Mm-hmm! Very likely," Guo Xi'er said. "She came alone, and it looks like she walked a long way. She looks exhausted!"

She looked at He Xiaoyue: "What do we do now?!"

If Zhou Suniang was really running away and had come to ask for their help, they should help her, both emotionally and logically. The Senate actually tacitly encouraged such "escapes." After all, this was also part of the "New Life Movement."

However, from a business perspective, if Wanzi Pavilion really got involved, the commercial consequences would be severe. Not only would they lose the Qu family as a major client, but it would also affect a large number of related wealthy families. This was also the main reason why Wu Xinsheng had been transferred away in the first place.

"If she really ran away, we still have to help," He Xiaoyue said hesitantly. "Otherwise, the Chiefs won't be happy."

"Mm-hmm, that's what I think too. If we lose some business, so be it." Guo Xi'er suddenly made up her mind.

"Maybe she isn't running away," He Xiaoyue said. "Let's invite her to the lounge to sit for a while and probe her intentions."

The two of them went to the VIP room together and saw Zhou Suniang leaning diagonally on the sofa, her face full of haggardness, looking as if she had aged several years. He Xiaoyue was secretly startled; had she suffered some great grievance at home?

However, unlike Sister Lian, who had looked beaten and fearful, Zhou Suniang was full of heavy thoughts, her beautiful eyes burning with an intense flame. As for what weighed on her mind, it was most likely related to a man.

Before He Xiaoyue could speak, Zhou Suniang opened her mouth and said, "Miss He, I want to find Wu Xinsheng."

He Xiaoyue was dumbfounded. Sure enough!

Reasonably speaking, the Senate had always supported mutual affection between men and women and the pursuit of free love. But the fact that the man haunting Zhou Suniang's dreams turned out to be Wu Xinsheng was somewhat unexpected for both Guo and He. Wu Xinsheng was unprepossessing, an "old man" in his early thirties, and missing an arm to boot.

What exactly did Zhou Suniang see in such a man? For a moment, He Xiaoyue felt Master Qu was being shortchanged.

"He's already been transferred..." Guo Xi'er said hurriedly. "Last time... last time you came to ask about him, he had already been transferred—to the Nansha Textile Mill in Xiangshan to be a manager."

He Xiaoyue couldn't help but glare at Guo Xi'er, thinking, *Why are you telling her so clearly!*

Sure enough, Zhou Suniang took a letter out of her handbag: "I wrote to the Nansha Mill. They wrote back to me. They said Master Wu brought workers back to Lingao for training at the end of last month..."

When He Xiaoyue saw the Nansha Model Textile Mill stamp on the envelope, she groaned inwardly. *Your factory is just as meddlesome! What business is it of yours!*

Zhou Suniang had risked running out alone just to see him... He Xiaoyue felt even more strongly that it wasn't worth it for her.

"But he hasn't come here," He Xiaoyue said. "He's no longer a Wanzi Pavilion employee. Even if he returns to Lingao, he won't come to Wanzi Pavilion."

"Doesn't he live here?!"

"Well, he used to live in the Wanzi Pavilion dormitory when he worked here. He's not one of us anymore, so how could he still live here?" He Xiaoyue tried hard to dissociate the shop from Wu Xinsheng.

Zhou Suniang's eager eyes dimmed for a moment, then instantly lit up again. "He worked here for so long; if he returned to Lingao, he would definitely come back to visit. The factory said he was bringing people to Wanzi Pavilion for training this time!" As she spoke, disregarding their willingness, she pulled a letter from her bag. "If he comes, please give this letter to him!"

He Xiaoyue cried out internally. *Why is this happening again!* Just as she was about to refuse, a female shop assistant ran in, flustered.

"He... He..."

"What is i..."

Before she could finish, a tremendous uproar erupted outside. Guo and He were both startled. Ignoring Zhou Suniang for the moment, they went to the door and looked out. They saw a dark mass of people standing in the foyer corridor, shouting and clamoring, while two or three shop assistants struggled to deal with them.

An ominous premonition surged in He Xiaoyue's heart. Suddenly, the noise in the corridor rose sharply. With a bang, the door was pushed open, and another salesgirl ran over: "Designer He, Designer Guo, it's bad! Someone..."
