# Chapter 2847: New Turmoil at Wanzi Pavilion

There was a bitter irony in the fact that the handbag Zhou Suniang carried—reportedly crafted from meticulously stitched "dragon" (crocodile) skin—was worth more than an ordinary naturalized worker earned in an entire year. Inside it, the vanity case, comb, lipstick, and eyebrow pencil... any single item would cover a month's expenses for a common family, perhaps several months. Yet she had no money.

The Qu family always bought on credit at the "established" shops. For places that did not extend credit, a steward would accompany them to settle the bill. As a "mistress," she never carried money herself.

The coins she had spent traveling from her residence to the City Rail station had come from what she had managed to save from her two yuan monthly allowance. Two yuan a month was roughly what an entry-level local employee earned, but in a wealthy household like the Qu family, such a trivial sum hardly amounted to anything.

Unfortunately, the two yuan and change she had carefully budgeted for her expenses had been picked from her pocket the moment she boarded the City Rail. Zhou Suniang usually went out with a retinue of servants and maids—at least two or three people accompanying her. Lingao appeared to be such a peaceful and prosperous place that it had lowered her guard. Moreover, her attire was simply too conspicuous.

Fortunately, a conductor passed by at that moment, and she learned she needed to disembark at Bairen East. The station was not far from Wanzi Pavilion, so there would be no need to hire a carriage.

Hearing this, she finally allowed herself a sigh of relief. As long as she reached Wanzi Pavilion, everything would be fine. She could simply borrow a yuan or two from the counter.

The City Rail arrived at Bairen East, and Zhou Suniang stepped off. She was relatively familiar with this area and quickly recognized the direction to Wanzi Pavilion.

It was actually less than half a *li* from the station to the shop, but for a woman with "liberated feet" like Zhou Suniang—feet that had once been bound and later released—walking even this short distance proved strenuous.

Bairen East was a bustling station. Aside from the time she had accompanied the Master and Madam on the City Rail shortly after arriving in Lingao to "experience Australian luxury," this was her first time riding alone, and her first time arriving at Bairen East by herself.

The square before the red brick station building teemed with people. Peddlers wearing "Licensed Operation" badges on their chests hawked food and miscellaneous goods. Zhou Suniang had visited Bairen many times before, but usually she had hurried past in a carriage or rickshaw. The lively market scene before her now filled her with both delight and a vague apprehension—after all, her money had just been stolen.

She stood at the exit of the Bairen East City Rail station, her heart a tangle of emotions. Her hand unconsciously touched her handbag, where the one yuan and change she had carefully calculated should have been, but now there was only cold air. She drew a deep breath, trying to calm her unease, yet the clamor of the square only heightened her agitation.

Her gaze wandered through the crowd, searching for a trace of familiarity, but all she found were unfamiliar faces. The vendors' hawking, children's laughter, and pedestrians' conversations wove together into a vivid urban tapestry. Zhou Suniang felt as though she were being swept into a vast vortex, drawn inexorably toward an unknown destiny.

Her feet moved of their own accord toward Wanzi Pavilion, each step feeling exceptionally heavy. Her "liberated feet" seemed somehow out of place in this era; every step felt like a farewell to her past. Though her clothes were magnificent, she appeared strikingly incongruous amid the crowd, attracting many curious gazes.

A nameless fear welled up within her. She quickened her pace, but her footing grew increasingly unsteady, as though she might stumble at any moment.

On the western side of the square stood a gate-like frame. Locked to it were pickpockets and thieves caught at the station and in the surrounding area—these "minor offenders." After being sentenced by the Public Order Court, they were publicly whipped in the square and then locked here for display. Men and women of various appearances squatted or sat beneath the frame, their expressions varied. To Zhou Suniang, these people seemed no different from wild beasts.

She tried to walk faster, eager to leave this noisy, crowded place behind.

Fortunately, Wanzi Pavilion was not far from Bairen East station. After walking a short distance along the street, she spotted its storefront, sandwiched between two larger shops. It was unassuming; one might easily overlook the "Wanzi Pavilion" signboard without paying close attention.

The moment she pushed open the spring door, a wave of coolness washed over her. The heat and anxiety that had filled her body and mind instantly faded, and her steps steadied.

"Zhou Suniang is here?" He Xiaoyue was surprised.

"That's right, it's her!" Guo Xi'er nodded emphatically.

"But she didn't make an appointment, and she hasn't ordered any clothes in the last two months..." He Xiaoyue said. "Is she here to rest her feet?"

Wealthy women who were regular customers did indeed have the habit of stopping by Wanzi Pavilion to rest and enjoy a cup of tea when they grew tired from shopping.

"I'm telling you, this is a big matter!" Guo Xi'er lowered her voice and leaned close to her ear.

"She's run away?!" He Xiaoyue, having served as a women's cadre for a long time, naturally thought of this possibility. Although she had changed professions, she had witnessed cases of wives and concubines from wealthy families running away several times. As a women's cadre, she had even participated in handling the aftermath. Since joining Wanzi Pavilion, she had heard of similar incidents. Take the Qu family where Zhou Suniang lived, for instance—not long ago, someone had run away, causing quite a stir for a while.

If she were still a women's cadre, He Xiaoyue would naturally think "Good for her," "Wonderful escape," "Run until the masters scream." But right now, she was a designer at Wanzi Pavilion, and her primary concern was "business."

It didn't matter if Zhou Suniang ran away, but if she got Wanzi Pavilion involved, they could forget about doing business with the Qu family in the future. This would be a tremendous loss for her. After all, the female members of the Qu family particularly appreciated her designs and were currently her biggest clients. He Xiaoyue still remembered how An Jiu had helped Sister Lian escape, angering the Qu family and causing her father's Ruihexiang shop to lose a major customer.

"Mm-hmm! Very likely," Guo Xi'er said. "She came alone, and it looks like she walked quite a distance. She looks exhausted!"

She looked at He Xiaoyue. "What do we do now?"

If Zhou Suniang was truly running away and had come seeking their help, they should help her—both emotionally and logically. The Senate actually tacitly encouraged such "escapes." After all, this was also part of the "New Life Movement."

However, from a business perspective, if Wanzi Pavilion really became involved, the commercial consequences would be severe. Not only would they lose the Qu family as a major client, but it would also affect a large number of related wealthy families. This was also the main reason why Wu Xinsheng had been transferred away in the first place.

"If she really ran away, we still have to help," He Xiaoyue said hesitantly. "Otherwise, the Chiefs won't be happy."

"Mm-hmm, that's what I think too. If we lose some business, so be it." Guo Xi'er suddenly made up her mind.

"Perhaps she isn't running away," He Xiaoyue said. "Let's invite her to the lounge to sit for a while and feel out her intentions."

The two of them went to the VIP room together and found Zhou Suniang leaning against the sofa, her face haggard, looking as though she had aged several years. He Xiaoyue was secretly startled. Had she suffered some terrible grievance at home?

However, unlike Sister Lian, who had appeared beaten and fearful, Zhou Suniang was burdened with heavy thoughts, her beautiful eyes burning with an intense flame. As for what weighed on her mind—it was most likely related to a man.

Before He Xiaoyue could speak, Zhou Suniang opened her mouth and said, "Miss He, I want to find Wu Xinsheng."

He Xiaoyue was dumbfounded. Just as she had suspected!

Reasonably speaking, the Senate had always supported mutual affection between men and women and the pursuit of free love. But the fact that the man haunting Zhou Suniang's dreams turned out to be Wu Xinsheng was somewhat unexpected for both Guo and He. Wu Xinsheng was plain-looking, an "old man" in his early thirties, and missing an arm to boot.

What exactly did Zhou Suniang see in such a man? For a moment, He Xiaoyue felt that Master Qu was being shortchanged.

"He's already been transferred..." Guo Xi'er said hurriedly. "Last time... last time you came asking about him, he had already been transferred—to the Nansha Textile Mill in Xiangshan to serve as a manager."

He Xiaoyue couldn't help but glare at Guo Xi'er, thinking, *Why are you telling her so much!*

Sure enough, Zhou Suniang produced a letter from her handbag. "I wrote to the Nansha Mill. They wrote back. They said Master Wu brought workers back to Lingao for training at the end of last month..."

When He Xiaoyue saw the Nansha Model Textile Mill stamp on the envelope, she groaned inwardly. *Your factory is just as meddlesome! What business is it of yours!*

Zhou Suniang had risked running out alone just to see him... He Xiaoyue felt even more strongly that it wasn't worth it for her.

"But he hasn't come here," He Xiaoyue said. "He's no longer a Wanzi Pavilion employee. Even if he returns to Lingao, he won't come to Wanzi Pavilion."

"Doesn't he live here?!"

"Well, he used to live in the Wanzi Pavilion dormitory when he worked here. He's not one of us anymore, so how could he still live here?" He Xiaoyue tried hard to distance the shop from Wu Xinsheng.

Zhou Suniang's eager eyes dimmed for a moment, then instantly lit up again. "He worked here for so long; if he returned to Lingao, he would certainly come back to visit. The factory said he was bringing people to Wanzi Pavilion for training this time!" As she spoke, disregarding their reluctance, she pulled a letter from her bag. "If he comes, please give this letter to him!"

He Xiaoyue cried out internally. *Why is this happening again!* Just as she was about to refuse, a female shop assistant rushed in, flustered.

"He... He..."

"What is i..."

Before she could finish, a tremendous uproar erupted outside. Guo and He were both startled. Setting Zhou Suniang aside for the moment, they hurried to the door and looked out. They saw a dark mass of people standing in the foyer corridor, shouting and clamoring, while two or three shop assistants struggled to manage them.

An ominous premonition surged in He Xiaoyue's heart. Suddenly, the noise in the corridor rose sharply. With a bang, the door burst open, and another salesgirl rushed over. "Designer He, Designer Guo, it's bad! Someone..."
