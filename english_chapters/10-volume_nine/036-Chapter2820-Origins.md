# Chapter 2820 Origins

Like most chain restaurants in the old timeline, Peony House's fries also used frozen semi-finished products delivered from the central kitchen. They were first fried in oil at about 175°C, removed before turning yellow and cooled, then fried again in 190-200°C hot oil for about a minute before immediately being sprinkled with seasoning. Not only was a lot of oil used in the frying pan, but it had to be changed regularly. These conditions determined that fries were not a food suitable for home preparation.

While Sonya tasted fries one after another, Sonya unexpectedly fell silent and leafed through the menu she had kept. Then she suddenly pushed the menu to Zahra and asked, "Do you think this story is true?"

Zahra looked and saw Sonya was pointing to the beginning of the menu. On the left was a reproduction of the *Along the River During the Qingming Festival* from the wall at the entrance; on the right was a passage telling the origin of Peony House.

This story was, of course, the fantasy version approved by the Ministry of Truth. It basically said Peony House was a famous restaurant during the Eastern Capital Bianliang era. Its founder, surnamed Mai, was once obsessed with alchemy seeking immortality, earning him the nickname "Old Mai the Alchemist." Though Mai's alchemy failed, he gained excellent fire-control skills from it. The Peony House he later opened specialized in fire-roasted flatbreads, ranked among the finest in the Eastern Capital. Though the Mai family were merchants, they were always loyal to the nation. After the Jingkang Disaster, the Peony House Mai family followed Emperor Gaozong across the river south and reopened in the temporary capital. After the Battle of Yashan, the family followed the Australia-Song ancestors on the long voyage to Australia, continuously improving according to Australia-Song customs, ultimately becoming Australia-Song's most famous dining enterprise with hundreds of shops.

Zahra roughly understood this passage. Nothing remarkable about it—just boasting about being a century-old establishment. Similar claims existed in Persia too.

"Probably true, possibly false." Zahra was unconcerned. "Anyway, he can't prove it, and you can't disprove it."

"That's true." Sonya said, a strange expression appearing on her face as she murmured, "Can't prove it, can't disprove it."

"What's wrong with you?" The Persian girl was puzzled.

"Just like Peony House's story, the Senate is also an existence that can't be proved and can't be disproved."

"What nonsense!" Zahra grew nervous, instinctively glancing around and lowering her voice. "Don't forget your status!"

But Sonya said quietly, "I've always found it strange."

Since she started working at the museum and executed multiple island surveys with the Long-Range Survey Teams, this doubt had grown stronger. During expeditions, Senator Cui Yunhong had left a deep impression on her. Not just because of Senator Cui's extensive knowledge and exploration abilities, but more because of his insights. For almost every plant, animal, and mineral specimen discovered, Senator Cui could identify it and give the corresponding name.

But the problem was, the names Senator Cui gave included not only Chinese but also corresponding Latin scientific names and classifications. As the official language of the ancient Roman Empire, Latin as a daily language had been dead for a long time. But due to its stability, it remained the absolute standard in European academic circles as an academic classification language—something Sonya, as a naturalist, was very familiar with.

Yet Senator Cui's Latin names were not only clear but basically consistent with what Europe currently used. Even for some that had only recently been named in Europe, they were completely identical—which was very strange. Rack her brains as she might, Sonya couldn't recall any example of Australia-Song scholars exchanging with European academic circles. This made her once again doubt the Senate's origins.

She had many similar doubts, including the multiple languages they commanded, their familiarity with European natural history: some scholars and scholarship that Sonya herself didn't know—and she frequently did field research in Europe. She knew quite well the academic world and scholars there, but not as thoroughly as the Senators. Especially these people's writings, which the museum's reference room actually had! Not only had them, but publishers had thoughtfully added various annotations...

"...I always feel that living among the Senators day after day, I could learn something from them, but there's nothing." Sonya smiled bitterly. "You know, I'm somewhat famous too..."

"Oh yes, you're quite famous!" The Persian girl joked with a touch of jealousy. "Our Senator Xu also says he moved too slowly and regrets not bidding for you..."

Sonya blushed. "What nonsense are you talking!"

"I'm stating facts."

"If I had a choice, I'd rather not have that kind of honor." Sonya said.

"Then wouldn't you also not have everything you have now?"

Sonya's face showed a conflicted expression. One could tell her heart was deeply torn.

Zahra actually quite understood her. The closer you got to the Senators, the less their halo shone, yet the more mysteries surrounded them. Zahra didn't immediately respond but watched the crowd pouring out of the neighboring cinema walk into the verdant garden across the street, looking at the restaurant where she sat and the various novelties that had come with the Senate.

After thinking a moment, Zahra replied: "Where they come from—is that really important? I rather think what they've changed, and what they'll continue to change, matters more." She looked into Sonya's blue eyes and continued, "Just like us. Do you think you're free now or not?"

Sonya understood at once. Their status was slave. When being sold in Basra, she knew her fate was to enter a "harem," becoming a concubine with no personal freedom, using only looks and body to please her master. But here, setting aside her own ability to go out on expeditions, even an ordinary maid like Zahra could have a free and comfortable life: going out shopping, chatting freely with friends. Such freedom was unheard of even in Europe, let alone conservative Eastern society.

"This is probably fate's arrangement." She sighed. Suddenly she thought of something. "I've always been curious—how did you learn English?"

In this timeline, English was still a very niche language, far less popular than French, German, or Italian. It was neither an academic language nor a symbol of noble cultivation, nor connected to culture and arts—no different from country dialects. Sonya's English came from her English mother. But a Persian girl far away in the Middle East—how had she learned it?

"Do you know Abbas the Great?"

"I've heard his name. A great monarch! A hero who defeated the Sultan."

"During his reign, he brought in English soldiers and craftsmen to help build armies and manufacture firearms. Our family was acquainted with the Shirley brothers at that time."

During the Safavid dynasty in Persia, to counter the increasingly severe military pressure from the Ottoman Turks, Abbas I actively introduced European military technology and political allies. The most enthusiastic were the English. England not only provided military aid and dispatched military advisors but even directly used its overseas fleet to provide military support for Persian actions in the Red Sea.

The Shirley brothers were two famous English adventurers in Persian history. The older brother, Anthony, graduated from Cambridge University, then served as a soldier adventuring everywhere. After meeting Abbas I, who had just come to the throne, he actively helped build an all-firearms army and promoted cooperation with European nations. After the older brother went as envoy to Europe around 1600 and eventually won favor from the Holy Roman Empire to become fleet commander, the younger brother Robert stayed in Persia to help build the army, then led three delegations to London and European nations, facilitating formal diplomatic relations between England and the Safavid dynasty before dying on the final mission. Through their efforts, the Safavid dynasty built an army that could match the Ottoman Empire, greatly improving Europe's situation against the Ottomans.

Zahra's family had learned English because of this connection.

"...In that case, how did you..."

High-born women becoming slaves wasn't rare in the Mediterranean world, either captured by pirates while at sea or seized when pirates raided coastal residences. But Zahra's family were genuine Persians, and she had heard Zahra say her home was in the interior mountains, not coastal residents.

"That brings us to Shah Safi. Do you know him?"

"Not really."

"He is a terrifying monarch." Here, Zahra couldn't help trembling.

Abbas himself, though brilliant, was suspicious and murderous, especially cruel to suspected family members. Thus, all three sons were deposed or killed. By the time Abbas I died in 1629, he could only name his grandson Safi as heir.

Safi acceded at only eighteen. Because of his father's fate, he was brutal and introverted, ruthlessly eliminating anyone who could threaten his power—nearly executing all Safavid princes and officials and generals who had achieved merit under his grandfather. Zahra's family had fallen in this violent storm.

"...After the family's downfall," Zahra sighed, "my sisters and I, along with several young brothers, all became slaves. That half year was like being in hell." She touched her chest. "Coming here, for me, was like arriving in a garden..."

Just then, their order arrived. The aroma dispelled the melancholy atmosphere. On a round wooden platter lay a circular flatbread cut into six slices. The flatbread top was covered with various fish, shrimp, and vegetables, bound together by a somewhat gooey yellow-white creamy substance. It gave off an enticing fragrance.

"Several spices here that Chinese don't use." Zahra sniffed and said. "How novel!"
