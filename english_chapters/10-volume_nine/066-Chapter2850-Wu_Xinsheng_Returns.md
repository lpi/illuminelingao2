# Chapter 2850: Wu Xinsheng Returns

"You're a Section Chief now—what favor could you possibly need from us?" He Xiaoyue teased. She had seen in the *Internal Reference* that shortly after Wu Xinsheng went to the Nansha Mill to guide operations, he had been formally appointed Deputy Section Chief of Nansha County's Industry Section, responsible for textile promotion and training throughout the county.

"I lack everything except people," Wu Xinsheng said, casually removing his hat and reaching to hang it on the hook behind the door. It missed and slipped down. He hurriedly caught it with the stump of his left arm.

In that moment, his sleeve slid back, revealing a patch of scars on the stump.

He Xiaoyue stiffened—wasn't that the very scar Zhou Suniang had described?

Though she didn't know how Zhou Suniang had learned of it, the fact that they were "old acquaintances" was now beyond doubt.

He Xiaoyue grew attentive and asked with deliberate casualness, "Section Chief Wu, is your trip to Nansha something of a homecoming in glory?"

"Oh?" Wu Xinsheng seemed surprised. "How did you know I'm from Nansha?"

"Hee hee, that's a secret!" He Xiaoyue studied him again. In a fleeting moment, she thought she detected a resemblance to Zhou Suniang. "Tell us—what exactly brings you here?"

"As I mentioned last time, I want to bring two girls over to learn lace making..."

"Didn't the Store Manager already agree to that? Have them start work next Monday."

"Now I'd like to add one more person. A girl who wants to learn clothing design."

"Adding someone is just adding someone," He Xiaoyue said, puzzled. "We don't make those decisions anyway..."

"The Store Manager said she needs to ask whether you're willing to serve as mentor."

He Xiaoyue hesitated. She wasn't keen on taking this on. Her own work already kept her too busy, and now she would have to train a newcomer from scratch. This newcomer was a complete blank slate; starting from zero would consume a great deal of time.

"Willing! Absolutely willing!" Guo Xi'er jumped in eagerly. "Another girl will make things livelier!"

"Haha, I knew you'd say that." Wu Xinsheng turned to He Xiaoyue, his gaze seeking her opinion.

"Since Xi'er has spoken, I have no objection either." Seeing her enthusiastic stance, He Xiaoyue couldn't bring herself to refuse outright. She looked at Guo Xi'er and said, "In that case, you'll have to be a good master to her."

"No problem at all," Guo Xi'er declared. "I'll teach her everything I know!"

"Excellent, excellent." Wu Xinsheng beamed. "I knew you were all warm-hearted sisters..."

"Aye, aye, enough of that." He Xiaoyue had developed a keen interest in the matter of Wu Xinsheng and Zhou Suniang. She promptly brewed a pot of tea, pulled him to sit down, and suggested they "catch up." Though Guo Xi'er could be oblivious about many things, she was remarkably perceptive in this regard. Sensing that He Xiaoyue wanted to pump Wu Xinsheng for information, she quickly slipped out to fetch a mixed fruit platter reserved for guests.

Wu Xinsheng was somewhat baffled by their enthusiasm. When they had worked together, their relationship had been cordial but not close. For one thing, there wasn't much common ground between general staff and designers; for another, Guo Xi'er's status was relatively sensitive. They had always maintained a certain distance.

But enthusiasm was always welcome. Even though he was now a "Section Chief," strictly speaking, there were plenty of matters where he still needed their help.

"Master Wu, you said you're from Nansha. Do you have any family left there?"

"There's been no one left for a long time," Wu Xinsheng said. "I only had a younger sister, who was sold by human traffickers."

"Have you never tried to find her?"

"I have, but where would I even look?" Wu Xinsheng smiled bitterly. "I only heard she was sold to somewhere very far away. After I arrived in Nansha, I tried to track down the trafficker, but he was long gone. Besides, after so many years, even if she's still alive, her appearance must have changed considerably."

He Xiaoyue felt a certain possibility growing stronger. She asked tentatively, "How many years younger is she than you?"

"About seven or eight, I think." Wu Xinsheng scratched his head uncertainly.

He Xiaoyue's eyes lit up. She studied Wu Xinsheng carefully again, staring until he grew uncomfortable and asked uneasily, "What's wrong?"

"Nothing... nothing..." Realizing she had lost her composure, He Xiaoyue quickly shook her head. "By the way, didn't you have any tokens or keepsakes?"

"We were destitute—what keepsakes could there have been..." At this, Wu Xinsheng seemed to recall something. "Actually, there was half a comb. When we were separated, I broke the comb our mother left us in half, one piece for each of us..." His voice grew distant as he spoke, lost in memory. "It's been so many years, I'd almost forgotten!"

"So, is the comb still around?"

"It should be, I suppose." Wu Xinsheng frowned. "Before leaving for Nansha, I packed up the odds and ends I didn't need and stored them at the Cadre Department's depot."

"Take it out and let us see it..." Guo Xi'er blurted out. He Xiaoyue had intended to work the conversation around to the comb gradually, but she hadn't expected the girl to just come out and say it.

"Half a broken comb—what's there to see?" Wu Xinsheng found the request strange.

"We just want to see it, that's all."

Wu Xinsheng looked puzzled but relented. "Alright, I'll look for it when I go to collect my things in the next few days." Then he added, "About the girl we're sending over..."

"Leave it to me, leave it to me," Guo Xi'er agreed readily. "I'll teach her well!"

Seeing Guo Xi'er agree so unreservedly, patting her chest in guarantee, He Xiaoyue quickly interjected: "What's the specific situation with this girl? Is she literate?"

"She's the sister of our Nansha Textile Mill's General Manager. Her name is Chen Yue," Wu Xinsheng said. "She's literate and knows needlework and such."

"If she's literate, that makes things easier." He Xiaoyue felt slightly relieved. "How old is she?"

"Sixteen, I believe." Wu Xinsheng said. "She's quite bright—she should be able to learn."

"The General Manager's sister... so she's a young lady!" Guo Xi'er seemed to flinch slightly.

"Well, yes, she is the General Manager's sister, but she's very down-to-earth—not some pampered young lady," Wu Xinsheng assured her. "She's skilled at spinning, weaving, and needlework. General Manager Chen values his sister greatly and wants her to have a promising future."

"What a wonderful brother!" Guo Xi'er said. Noticing the somewhat lonely expression that crossed Wu Xinsheng's face, she quickly added, "You're quite good too!"

He Xiaoyue found her disjointed speech both exasperating and amusing. She quickly steered the conversation elsewhere to smooth things over. The three discussed the upcoming training arrangements until a shop assistant came to announce the arrival of another customer, and only then did they part ways.

After Wu Xinsheng left, they attended to customers and received guidance from Liu Shuixin. Time slipped past unnoticed until well after six in the evening. By the time they finished tidying the office, the sky outside had already grown dark.

Both were single and lived in the dormitory, with decent incomes. After work, they usually paired up to dine out and browse the shops before returning to rest.

Stepping outside, they found the moon already climbing the ink-dark sky. The straight streets were lined with brilliant lights on both sides. Pedestrians bustled about, orderly yet lively. To both women, it felt almost dreamlike—the past dozen years had whirled by like images in a spinning lantern, and the road of the New World now lay right beneath their feet.

With the growing population and the transfer of some industrial capacity, the demand for labor in Lingao was no longer as acute as before. Working hours had been shortened, increasing the leisure time of naturalized citizens, which indirectly stimulated commercial development. The night market, once ending at ten, now extended until midnight.

The two strolled leisurely into a medium-sized ready-to-wear shop. Naturally, they wouldn't purchase these so-called "ready-made clothes" like ordinary naturalized citizens; they came mainly to understand consumer preferences. Though neither was a stunning beauty, their "Australian-style" attire, combined with the quiet elegance cultivated through years at Wanzi Pavilion, attracted countless gazes the moment they entered.

"Ladies, is there anything you'd like to see?" A salesgirl approached to greet them. He Xiaoyue smiled and listened to her introduction, when suddenly she spotted a familiar outfit—a simplified version of the "Drizzle on Duckweed." Though the fabric had been changed to cheaper civilian cloth and the effect was far inferior, the stylistic intent remained unmistakable.

Noticing where her gaze had fallen, the salesgirl said: "Miss has truly excellent taste. This set is our shop's best-seller. They say the designer received guidance from the Weaver Girl in a dream to create this outfit. Some even claim she is the reincarnation of the Weaver Girl herself..."

Guo Xi'er was already struggling to suppress her laughter. He Xiaoyue managed to maintain her composure and continued nodding.

Perhaps sensing these words weren't enough to sway them, the salesgirl brought out her trump card—a newly released copy of *Lingao Spring*, a recently published fashion magazine.

"Miss, look—this outfit is the 'Headline New Style' of the latest issue!"

The two women, who had been on the verge of bursting into laughter, suddenly fell silent in astonishment. Guo Xi'er snatched the magazine and flipped it open, momentarily speechless. *Lingao Spring* was the most authoritative fashion magazine published locally. The Headline New Style of each issue was carefully selected and voted upon by the relevant Senators. It had to be unique in design and meet certain sales requirements—a true fashion weather vane. In the past, this honor had always been monopolized by Senator designers. She had broken that record entirely.

"What?! Really?" He Xiaoyue asked anxiously.

"Really!" Guo Xi'er exclaimed. "It's 'Drizzle on Duckweed'!" She thrust the magazine into He Xiaoyue's hands. "Look! Look!"

He Xiaoyue was flustered and nervous. In her urgency, her vision blurred, and she couldn't make anything out. "Where? Where?" she kept asking.

After finally calming herself, she saw it clearly—the Headline New Style really was her design. The accompanying photo showed a rendering of a female Senator wearing it. Though she didn't recognize the woman, that figure and bearing were unmistakably beyond what any naturalized citizen could possess.

He Xiaoyue looked and looked, and finally burst out laughing. Once she started, she couldn't stop. She laughed until she trembled like a flower-laden branch swaying in the wind, her sides aching, barely able to support herself, wanting to crouch down.

Since escaping from the Chastity Court, she had experienced many happy moments, but she had never wanted to laugh like she did today. A joy from the depths of her heart, like a volcanic eruption, surged violently from the very core of her being.
