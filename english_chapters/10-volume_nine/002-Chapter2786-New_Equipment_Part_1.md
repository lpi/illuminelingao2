# Chapter 2786: New Equipment (Part 1)

Since the beginning of the Mainland Strategy, many institutions of the Senate gradually moved to Guangzhou. Some, although their headquarters did not move, established branches in Guangzhou. However, due to the multitude of businesses, the so-called branches grew larger day by day, while the headquarters became existence similar to a rear office instead. Some departments then began overall relocation.

The General Staff and the Department of Army were the central institutions of the Senate that moved to the mainland as a whole earlier. According to the decision of the General Assembly at the end of 1635, central departments first set up offices in Guangzhou. However, with the continuous deepening of military struggles, the General Staff and the Army still moved overall. After all, the focus of the massive Mainland Strategy was on ground combat, while the General Staff and the Ministry of Army were on the other side of the sea; this was unfavorable for military struggles.

When they first arrived on the mainland, conditions were very limited. The General Staff and the Army huddled together, settling in the former Ming Army drill ground in the east of Guangzhou city, surrounded by fences. Except for some old houses, most people pitched tents for office work,

The field state lasted for nearly half a year. Since most Senators were sent to substantiate the frontline troops, using tents was barely acceptable.

Naturally, no one could stand such a crude environment. When the war entered a stalemate stage, Director Hong of the Joint Logistics (Lianqin) then ran horses to enclose land.

Outside the East Gate of Guangzhou, close to the Pearl River, he enclosed a piece of land, roughly in the Dadao Road area of the old space-time (modern Guangzhou), used to build the new headquarters. This time tents were replaced by prefabricated houses. The original barbed wire + bamboo fence were also replaced by formal brick walls. Afterwards, bastions were added on the walls, and supporting barracks, trenches, forts... were built one after another, becoming a military fortress guarding Guangzhou. The prefabricated houses inside were also rebuilt into buildings one by one. By early 1637, this place temporarily named "South China Headquarters" finally had all simple temporary buildings demolished. Infrastructure such as office buildings, wired telegraph, dedicated wharf, dormitories, running water tower, coal storage yard, boiler room, bathhouse, etc., were basically in place. It became the largest stronghold of the Army in Guangzhou.

The General Staff and the Department of Army also moved to Guangzhou entirely. Following this, some training bases set up in Hong Kong previously also moved to the mainland one after another. After all, conditions in Hong Kong still had too many limitations, and water resources were limited. Placing too many large institutions there would affect each other's daily operations.

The Army and the General Staff were temporarily squeezed in an L-shaped three-story building, but conditions were greatly improved compared to before. Some Senators joked that if hostile saboteurs fired a rocket at this building, the Fubo Army would be directly hemiplegic.

After major hostilities and bandit suppression battles basically came to an end temporarily, both the Fubo Army and the National Army entered a rest and reorganization stage. The work of the General Staff and the Department of Army became relatively relaxed, able to focus more on troop construction and training consolidation work.

The army demonstrated its value as the number one gold-swallowing beast of the Senate in nearly two years of Mainland Strategy and public security warfare. Naturally, quite a few problems were also exposed. So these problems evolved into a big discussion on whether the military system needed reform and whether weapons should be upgraded.

These two topics could be considered annual topics in the Senate, brought out to be discussed every year. The conclusion... None.

Just as a certain Senator of the First Weapon Design Bureau said indignantly: "The force of inertia always exceeds the desire for technological change." This saying wasn't wrong originally, but the reason inertia was large lay largely in the cost required for technological change and the benefits brought by it.

Differing from what Senators thought, managers of the army, whether it was the army of the Third World or the US army seeking defeat in solitude after the Cold War, essentially were not interested in "technological leadership." They considered "cost" more.

Of course, as combat generals, naturally the more advanced the weapons the better, preferably Zentraedi Technology hitting Stone Age technology. But weapons were essentially "waste" that had no output but only consumption. Army managers had to consider the cost of maintenance and application.

In April 1637, Guangzhou was already bursting with spring. Various flowers and trees inside the General Staff compound bloomed in competition, bringing a touch of bright color here. Dongmen Chuiyu, the Executive Secretary of the Fubo Army General Staff, was reading a letter in his office in this L-shaped building.

Although his title had never changed from beginning to end, always "Executive Secretary of General Staff," nor had he actually served as a unit commander or been in charge of a certain important department, Dongmen Chuiyu's military rank rose steadily. If not for his comparative modesty, insisting on refusing promotion, he could hang the rank of Major General now.

Although Dongmen Chuiyu was still a Colonel, he was the most powerful Senator Officer in the Fubo Army—none other.

Although according to military rank and position, there were still several Senator Major Generals and Comrade Minister of Army ahead of him, controlling the daily affairs of the General Staff made the power he possessed greatly surpass the former.

At this moment in his office, Senator Dongmen was writing a reply letter.

The letter was an official letter sent by the Danzhou Industrial Zone Management Committee. The content of the letter was regarding the "Joint Logistics No. 37 Arsenal."

Although called "Joint Logistics No. N Arsenal," actually Joint Logistics didn't manage and construct arsenals specifically—this was still the affair of the industrial department. So this matter was still negotiated by a letter from the Industrial Zone Management Committee.

The incoming letter was not written by a certain Senator. Such official letters of personal autography were called "Memorandum" in the General Office system, considered the highest level. Instead, it was signed by the Committee Director Secretary. The content was the issue of No. 37 Factory landing (establishment).

This matter finally arrived before eyes. Dongmen Chuiyu thought when receiving the letter.

The rifle was designed in 1635 and finalized in 1637. The issue arose after finalization.

Since it was finalized, the Weapon Design Bureau proposed a request for re-equipment. The Planning Academy naturally solicited opinions from relevant departments and re-equipment plans.

The new breech-loading rifle had many benefits; this didn't need argumentation. Anyone could see it, let alone Senators who had peeked at the homework answers long ago.

So the General Staff wrote a very detailed report. First, it highly affirmed the excellence of the weapon: This is a revolutionary new rifle. After its equipment, the existing tactical system of the Army will change completely.

The problem lay in the sentence "tactical system change completely."

Weapons determine tactics, and tactics determine organization. Although the Minié rifle was progress compared to the flintlock musket, generally it didn't change the projection speed of weapons. So the army in 1860 was still the same set of lining up to be shot. The basic tactics used by Napoleon III's France, Austria, and Prussia at the beginning of the German Unification Wars were still line and column formations of the muzzle-loading era—although they already used breech-loading rifles.

If the Army carried out comprehensive re-equipment, it meant that the existing army training, organization, and tactical system would all be invalidated. The Army had to undergo comprehensive retraining and reorganization. The old tactical system dismantled, and the new one not yet formed, the troops would be in a weak state. For soldiers, the impact might not be big; a few months of intensive training could adapt to new weapons.

But for officers, it was tragic.

Senator officers of the Army system had completely thoroughly grasped linear tactics through long-term practical exploration. The cultivation education of officers and sergeants was also conducted based on this tactical principle. Although so far no serious field battle had been fought, through years of experience summary and exercise training, the organization method of large-scale battles was basically determined.

Redesigning tactics, the Army would directly lose active field combat capability. Large-scale engagement could only adopt defense-counterattack tactics.

Now was in the state of Mainland Strategy. Attacks from Ming army, peasant armies, Manchus, or armed riots of local forces could happen at any time. The Army would be in long-term combat readiness state, engaging in battle at any time. Large-scale alteration of the army's organizational structure and tactics would inevitably cause chaos.

The army was the basic guarantee of political power and couldn't be chaotic. Therefore, to not affect the combat capability of existing troops, the ideal method was to establish new troops. New troops adopt new weapons and new training. The problem was, this way, not to mention the army size suddenly becoming larger, because the new rifle had absolute advantage over the Minié rifle, new troops must have Senators holding key positions.

Senators serving as battalion-level officers, right now was basically an impossible thing.

Therefore, Senator officers of the Army had completely a kind of contradictory mood of love and hate mixed towards the matter of comprehensive re-equipment.

They naturally hoped the troops were well-equipped, but they didn't want everything they established to have to start all over again.

As for the view of Joint Logistics, it was quite impolite.

After the start of the Mainland War, with the deepening of controlled areas, the battle line became longer and longer, and the army scale would become more and more huge. The Type 1637 would cause extremely huge pressure on logistics and industrial capacity simultaneously. Especially the consumption of ammunition and the upper limit of supply.

Comrade Thorpe pointed out in the report that under new tactics, soldiers were in skirmisher state, lacking control and command of officers. In complex terrain and intense combat, soldiers would tend to conduct preventive shooting at suspicious targets, seeking to knock down more enemies before potential enemies launched attacks. Objectively increasing ammunition consumption.

Automatic weapons instead wouldn't, because soldiers knew the weapon in hand could fire a large amount of ammunition in a very short time to knock down multiple targets.

With Minié rifles, soldiers knew there was only one bullet in the gun, loading time was long, and shooting would be more cautious.

Switching to new rifles, the growth of ammunition consumption would be unpredictably large.

Because inland areas were still in the original 17th century, transportation costs were extremely high. If new weapons were adopted, with huge ammunition consumption, logistics demand and cost would be large beyond imagination.

Under the traffic conditions of the 17th century, the ammunition consumption of muzzle-loading weapons matched the logistics limit.

Joint Logistics stated, weapons are high-grade, but we can only supply the most suitable ones. Advanced doesn't represent suitable. If Type 1637 is to be fully equipped, a large amount of transportation tools, ships, carriages, livestock, etc., need to be added.

The Navy's report was very simple, just stating this gun is good; if the length could be shortened, it could be used as an excellent Navy rifle. And pointed out emphatically that the Marines needed to equip this new rifle very much.
