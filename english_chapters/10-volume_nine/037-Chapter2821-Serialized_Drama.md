# Chapter 2821 Serialized Drama

"There's basil, oregano, thyme, sage," Sonya sniffed and said. "How unusual—I've never seen Chinese use these spices."

"Naturally, this is Australian cuisine..."

"Aren't the Australians Chinese?"

"Well, I don't think they're quite like Chinese," the Persian girl hesitated.

"I think so too." Sonya picked up her fork, speared a still-hot slice of flatbread and put it in her mouth, along with the chilled Kvass that had been served. It was indeed a flavor she'd never tasted before. Especially the yellow-white substance—overflowing with rich dairy fragrance yet with a smooth texture, truly first-rate delicious.

With just one bite, they knew this yellow-white substance was cheese, made according to European methods.

The two girls of course didn't know this yellow-white substance was the core ingredient of old-timeline pizza—mozzarella cheese. This light cheese, originating from a southern Italian city in the old timeline, was made from buffalo or cow milk and required relatively complex steps with specific cultures and rennet for fermentation—one of the Senate's closely guarded secrets. Senator Huang Dashan, who had brought the cultures, earned considerable profit in the future by selling the corresponding technical patents to Peony House's owners.

The two happily finished their meal. The bill came to about 1 silver yuan voucher, close to Zahra's expectations. With the discount coupon, they got an extra reduction. Leaving and seeing the stream of diners downstairs, Zahra couldn't help but sigh—whoever the owner was, they were definitely going to get rich. In fact, Zahra didn't know that she herself could be considered one of Peony House's mistresses.

During the Second Plenary restructuring, Xiao Zishan had gotten ideas about the circulation voucher dividends in Senator accounts. Under his initiative, the Administrative Office and Planning Commission jointly launched a series of optional internal Senator investment projects. Peony House, positioned as the new timeline's McDonald's, was one of them. And Senator Xu, ranked fifth in deposits, was undoubtedly an important participant in this plan. If anyone could look through Peony House's shareholder list, they would find Senator Xu's name prominently near the top.

Less than three kilometers from Peony House, in the administrative district of the old county seat, the weekly Council of State meeting was proceeding as usual.

"Next item on the agenda: Mainland Cultural Infiltration Strategy. This topic is rather long, so everyone might want to take care of personal needs first." Xiao Zishan handed out a stack of documents, giving one to each Senator while speaking with a smile.

By the time the leaders returned to the conference room with satisfied smiles, Dingding had already sat down at the conference table with his assistant Okamoto Makoto, face beaming. Though Dingding smiled brightly, he was actually quite unhappy inside, especially seeing Hu Qingbai, who rarely attended Council of State meetings—his heart was full of disdain.

At the Third Plenary, the Culture and Science Ministry was established, combining propaganda, technology, and education—three powerful departments—which resulted in the largest one, Education, taking advantage. The schoolteacher Hu Qingbai "usurped" the position of Culture Minister. "Who knows how many female students he's corrupted!" Dingding cursed internally while greeting Hu Qingbai with a radiant smile.

Hu Qingbai's heart at this moment was no happier than Dingding's. This kind of theoretical meeting about strategic direction was not his interest at all. If Dingding's Mainland Cultural Infiltration Strategy hadn't extended beyond the Culture Ministry's scope and required military and overseas station support, he wouldn't have bothered attending the Central Council of State meeting. Best if this project got shot down; otherwise, he'd inevitably be saddled with yet another "Such-and-Such Working Group Leader" title. These were far less important than the basic education planning and construction in Guangdong. Now Guangdong was already beginning educational development according to Hu Qingbai's vision: establishing a basic education system centered on Guangzhou—one middle school and two complete primary schools in Guangzhou. Larger cities like Zhaoqing, Wuzhou, Nanning, and Guilin would first build complete primary schools; county seats would establish junior primary schools... Worker night schools in industrial cities like Guangzhou and Foshan, plus literacy classes run through the military.

This grand plan required continuous investment. Naturally, the Senate didn't have that much money.

How to get the Senate to fund his plan—that was what concerned him most. Cultural infiltration, arts and entertainment activities—in his view, all a waste of money.

Just as Hu Qingbai was daydreaming, Dingding had already begun explaining his "strategy."

"...We've only paused our northern offensive, but we still need to consider two issues: First, how do we acquire more resources from the northern mainland market during peacetime—including human resources? Second, when we advance north again, how do we gain local support? Therefore, we need to use our cultural advantages to launch an offensive on the cultural battlefield—before stepping foot on northern soil, cultivating forces friendly to us, establishing allied armies and collaborators..."

Though three meters away with no risk of being sprayed by Dingding's spittle, Ma Qianzhu still instinctively picked up a towel to wipe his face. Hot towel rolls were a recent trend; most formal meetings attended by Senators were now equipped with this service. What he didn't know was that this Australian-style enjoyment had already, under certain commercial interests' promotion, spread to large entertainment venues in Lingao and Guangzhou. In these entertainment venues, the white towels prepared for certain important occasions were even embroidered with a line of small text: "Administrative Office Special Supply."

"The importance of cultural infiltration is beyond doubt. I believe everyone has read the documents. Please be brief and get directly to the operational phase," Ma Qianzhu finally couldn't help interrupting Dingding. His hands, which had been loosely cupped over his teacup, took the opportunity to change position.

Dingding realized he'd been blowing too hard and quickly cut to the substance. In fact, Dingding's strategy was conceptually easy to understand—roughly a simplified version of "peaceful evolution," almost plagiarizing a batch of relevant papers from the old timeline. Since information exchange wasn't as convenient as the old timeline, "Voice of Australia-Song" was out of the question. So the actual offensive directions had been innovated by Dingding, divided into three: cultural carrier delivery, promoting personnel mobility, and commercial-technical diffusion.

Cultural carrier delivery mainly meant opera, storytelling, popular novels, and similar methods. Dingding set a keynote for these new artistic works: "Promote the happy life in Australia-Song, reflect the dark rule of Ming." The former was to induce readers to unconsciously compare and develop longing and affinity; the latter, since they couldn't directly attack Ming, used indirect criticism and metaphor to reflect the various ills of Ming rule. The broadsides widely used in the Second Counter-Encirclement Campaign were mentioned only briefly in the plan.

To strengthen persuasiveness, Dingding had specially prepared two case studies. One was the storytelling series *Short-Hairs' Amazing Tales*; the other was the puppet show *Pleasant Village Stories*. Everyone had seen the puppet shows—*South Sea Storm* and *The Trial* had been performed hundreds of times across Hainan. Changing the script was easily understood. But this storytelling? The audience immediately erupted in whispers.

"*Pleasant Village Stories*? Sounds very familiar!"

"Pleasant Sheep, Beautiful Sheep, Warm Sheep, Fit Sheep, Lazy Sheep..." someone began humming softly.

...

"Dingding, are you trying to reinvent storytelling?" Wu De finally raised the question dripping with malice. Dingding was planning to use this opportunity to crown himself as the grandmaster of folk arts, so Wu De used the phrase "reinvent."

As a professional critic, how could Dingding not know the Senators' little schemes? He was well prepared for this question.

"'With every sound uttered, listeners hear it as swords and cavalry, sweeping the empty sky. Or as wind wails and rain weeps, birds grieve and beasts tremble. The hatred of a fallen nation suddenly arises; the sound of the sandalwood clapper pales...' This is Huang Zongxi's description of Liu Jingting's storytelling. This Liu Jingting is currently performing in Nanjing. In fact, several famous storytelling works like *Three Kingdoms*, *Water Margin*, and *Sui-Tang* have already appeared. Of course, they're not called 'storytelling' yet—more like 'sung tales.' Liu Jingting performs to the accompaniment of string instruments."

After the educational bit, dispelling the Senators' doubts, Dingding grandly waved his hand and continued: "You could say reinventing is right too. We're going to reinvent folk arts using modern management thinking. The traditional master-apprentice, oral transmission, secretive old customs will be utterly defeated before our serialized-drama production method, and then be reborn!"

"Get to the point." Seeing Dingding about to enter passionate mode again, Ma Qianzhu quickly interrupted him, rescuing the meeting from the wrong track.

Through Dingding's case introduction, everyone finally understood what the so-called "serialized drama mode" meant. Roughly it borrowed from TV series production methods: thematically compile various news materials into highly story-driven scripts, then adapt them into different forms like storytelling, drama, puppet shows, and so on. The final products would be standardized by the Propaganda Department—mainly scripts, plus costumes and props for drama—then disseminated into Ming territory through overseas stations using "invite in, send out" methods.

In ancient society, learning costs were high and script update frequencies were low. A script remaining unchanged for decades or centuries after creation was normal. *Water Margin* had been polished from the Song dynasty to modern times. For the relatively popular northern storytelling, commonly performed scripts numbered fewer than twenty. Traditional opera had more repertoire, but commonly performed scripts also didn't exceed a hundred. Though from a refinement perspective, all these works had been tempered through countless performances. But dated plots and monotonous storylines were undeniable. Their century-long continuity was caused by the cultural market's lack of products.
