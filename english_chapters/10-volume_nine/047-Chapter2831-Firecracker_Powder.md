# Chapter 2831 Firecracker Powder

"Dehumidifying buckets. Inside is calcium chloride supplied by the alkali plant—it absorbs moisture from the air." Qi Kelong explained: "Once ammonium nitrate absorbs moisture, it can cake up and become very troublesome, so workshop humidity must be carefully controlled. Look over there—"

The conveyor belt was lined with shell casings shipped from Maniao. Though the latest model 75mm breech-loading shells, these black iron lumps had been turned and polished, gleaming with dark reflections—of course, nowhere near as attractive as the brilliant golden display on the cartridge assembly line. Besides, to save costs, the Senators had changed the driving bands from copper to lead alloy, looking gray and dull. Following Qi Kelong's pointing finger, Ruibao saw female workers fitting funnel-like devices onto the openings at the shell tops, then conveying them to a machine. A threaded metal rod descended through the funnel deep into the shell body. When the motor hummed, the threaded rod spun rapidly. Ruibao curiously moved closer and saw spiral tubes on the machine continuously discharging pale yellow powder granules into the funnel mouth. They first accumulated at the funnel's lip, then quickly sank into the shell casing with the threaded rod's rotation, disappearing inside.

"Is this gunpowder?" Mai Ruibao stared at the yellowish-white granules that looked like crumbs. He couldn't mentally connect this rice-flour-like stuff with gunpowder or explosives.

"It's 80/20 Amatol." Seeing Mai Ruibao's confusion, Qi Kelong explained: "A mixture of ammonium nitrate and TNT, with ammonium nitrate making up 80% by mass—an explosive near zero oxygen balance. So as for explosive power, compared to it, black powder is—" Qi Kelong mischievously blinked—"just a ground rat."

Before she finished, the auger whirred again, rotating in the opposite direction, gradually withdrawing upward from the shell body. The spiral tube delivery outlet stopped discharging explosive granules. "Comrade Reporter, this is an auger filling machine. While automating filling, it compacts the explosive, increasing charge density and thus the shell's explosive force." Filled shells were conveyed into a blast-resistant room. Through the glass, Ruibao saw workers operating on shell heads with cutting tools, then brushing some liquid onto them. "The powder surface at the opening needs to be scraped flat, a hole drilled to accommodate the booster charge tube. After everything's done, the powder surface must be brushed with asphalt varnish to seal out moisture—because ammonium nitrate absorbs moisture too easily."

Sun Shangxiang suddenly spoke to Qi Kelong: "Comrade, have you always worked here?" Mai Ruibao suddenly realized this was Miss Sun's first time interviewing a naturalized-citizen worker since they'd gotten off the urban rail: "May I ask—do you love this job?"

"How could I not love it? Teacher Qi taught me all his knowledge, led me onto the path of researching chemical engineering. How could I not love everything Teacher Qi taught me, love work where I can apply this knowledge?" Qi Kelong's small face flushed red again: "Comrade Reporter, if you understood explosives, you'd know they're very interesting, even cute." She raised her hand to point at the conveyor belt coming out of the blast-resistant room, carrying shells disappearing at the workshop's end: "Once they pass quality inspection and have fuses installed, it's like children you've raised finally coming of age—you can look forward to them one day spreading their wings."

Miss Sun knitted her brows. Her pen touched the notebook but didn't write a single character—clearly completely unable to comprehend Qi Kelong's answer. The interview couldn't proceed. To ease this awkward situation, Mai Ruibao had to change the subject: "This automated shell filling is efficient and fast. But can new explosive production keep up? Will we go back to using black powder?"

"Teacher Qi said Specialty Chemical's production capacity is currently just scratching the surface. Even at current chemical product output, a year's 80/20 Amatol could fill at least 10,000 75mm shells. Once Danzhou's chemical industry is fully completed, over 200,000 75mm shells could be filled annually. In fact, we won't need that many—half the shells are shrapnel, which only use black powder." Qi Kelong, warming to the topic, led Mai Ruibao and Sun Shangxiang into an adjacent workshop: "Come see this side—the filling process is even simpler."

The conveyor belt in this workshop carried wooden insert racks with shiny small steel cylinders neatly arranged in the slots. Ruibao learned from Qi Kelong these were HE shell bodies for the Type 34 autocannon, with filling funnels inserted in their top openings. Gradually, his amazement grew: workers pushed over flatbed carts, opened "thermal water buckets" on top, scooped out a yellow "oil," portioned it into several carrying buckets, then poured it into the funnels one by one. He looked closer: the bucket interior was painted with measurement markings for workers to dispense precisely. The "yellow oil" remaining at the bucket bottom still gave off some heat, like melted soap. Nearby, Chairman Wang asked Senator Qi with keen interest: "What explosive is being poured in?"

"Torpex 70/30. 30% RDX."

"Specialty Chemical can already produce RDX?"

"The pharmaceutical factory has been supplying hexamethylenetetramine for a long time. Nitrating hexamine to make RDX isn't complicated—it just consumes too much nitric acid. Not as economical as TNT. Right now we're making Torpex mainly for booster charges. The Navy requires autocannons to blow up fire ships as quickly as possible—so they benefit too." Qi Chuqin was in full flow when a female shriek interrupted him. Everyone's gaze focused on Sun Shangxiang—while walking, she'd lifted her leg and bumped a bucket on a cart, yelping in pain from the burn. "Hey hey, little girl, watch out—that's connected to a steam pipe." Mai Ruibao only then noticed iron pipes with valves standing beside the conveyor, connected to fittings on the "thermal water buckets"—the bucket's double walls were filled with high-temperature steam. "That's how the Torpex mixture stays in molten state."

Sun Shangxiang refused Mai Ruibao's offer to help her rest somewhere, limping along behind the Senators. Only Chairman Wang's comment could be heard: "This process is excellent—low dependence on specialized equipment, easy to scale up production."

"The Chairman is perceptive. Cast filling is simply efficient." Qi Chuqin maintained his passionate lecturing tone: "I can easily modify the Amatol formula, raising TNT content to 40% or 50% for very castable explosives. Army mountain and field artillery and Navy shells could all switch to cast filling—production efficiency could multiply several times over. In short, we need more TNT. Please have Planning Commission allocate more nitric acid and sulfuric acid quotas so Specialty Chemical's TNT continuous production line can run at full capacity."

"Director, I have a question." Sun Shangxiang suddenly spoke up. "Why do all these, um, explosives that our Great Song produces have such strange names? TNT, hexamine, RDX—where do these names come from?"

"Well, they're basically English abbreviations of these products' chemical molecular formulas..."

"Since they're all made by our Great Song, why use English abbreviations?"

Sun Shangxiang's soul-piercing question instantly crashed Qi Chuqin's system.

He had taught chemical compound naming principles—like why it was called trinitrotoluene. But where its trade name came from—no one had ever asked. Up to now, not even his most capable, closest disciples had raised this question.

Seeing Qi Chuqin speechless, Wang Luobin immediately improvised: "About this question—English has advantages in abbreviations. Easy to write, easy to remember. For someone who doesn't understand chemistry, is TNT easier to remember, or trinitrotoluene? So in Australia, many industries use English for abbreviations."

Qi Chuqin hastily said: "Chairman Wang is absolutely right." Thinking: Wang Luobin truly deserves to be Senate Chairman—his bullshitting skills are top-notch!

Sun Shangxiang opened her mouth. Apparently, the explanation hadn't fully convinced her. But ultimately, she didn't ask further.

"Before coming here, I specifically consulted with Comrade Wu De. The Logistics Bureau's ordnance factories' first-phase military production target is 100,000 rounds of new rifle ammunition and 10,000 new explosive shells annually. Today's on-site visit has moved me greatly. You comrades have been dispatched to a remote backwater, pioneering from nothing. In less than three years, you've built such a great enterprise and reached the established targets. I'm truly in awe, and regret being away from the production front for too long." At the lunch table, Chairman Wang spoke eloquently: "Some comrades in the Center indeed worry that investing too many resources in military equipment will cause waste and affect other economic sectors' development. Some cite the example that Japan fired only 43,000 shells to win the First Sino-Japanese War. Ming has no Beiyang Army, no Northern Fleet—why does the Senate need so many shells and cartridges? I say that's wrong. The Japanese Army deployed 6 divisions, accumulated deployment of 170,000 troops—not counting the Combined Fleet. Can Fubo Army reach even a fraction of that number? When manpower is insufficient, we must consider expanding our advantage in shells and explosives."

"I can tell you all clearly: according to reliable intelligence, military threat from the Ming court is imminent. The Manchus also very likely will enter the pass following historical inertia. The struggle situation facing the Senate is complex and arduous. But seeing your achievements today, I'm fully confident we can achieve comprehensive victory at a smaller cost..."

Mai Ruibao and other naturalized-citizen escorts sat at another table. Chairman Wang's words he understood only vaguely, but the words "Manchu" made his whole body shiver—he almost couldn't hold his chopsticks. Recalling how earlier in the ammunition factory, as they toured through to the quality inspection room, Qi Kelong had pointed at a 75mm shell sawn in half lengthwise, indicating the explosive distribution in the cross-section, lecturing endlessly about shell filling knowledge while complaining that the malleable cast iron shell body walls were too thick, taking up too much charge space and limiting shell power: "Teacher Qi teaches that high-strength forged steel shells can greatly reduce wall thickness. Same caliber shells could have 1 to 2 times more charge, and fragmentation would also greatly increase—"
