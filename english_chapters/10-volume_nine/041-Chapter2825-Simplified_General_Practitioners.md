# Chapter 2825 Simplified General Practitioners

Walking out of the Combat Injury Department's last ward, Shi Niaoren was giving the doctors parting instructions while savoring the process of stumping all the doctors, including several Senator physicians, during rounds.

"Hmph, my PhD isn't a water degree..." Dr. Shi returned to his office at the General Hospital—he had dedicated offices in all Health institutions. The life secretary waiting by the staircase hurried over, taking the case files from the little nurse beside Shi Niaoren, then quickly took the white coat he'd removed. After he sat down, she immediately presented a cup of tea at just the right temperature.

Shi Niaoren sipped his mild tea while reviewing the *Medical Business Operations Report* from Director Deng. Every hospital's revenue showed explosive growth—especially the Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital, with both revenue and profit margins up hundreds of percent from the previous year.

Looks like our medicine is getting recognition from everyone, he thought. No wonder Director Deng was thinking about running more hospitals...

Just as he was pondering, the life secretary brought over a cigar tray, already containing a cut authentic "South Sea-Caribbean Cigar." This cigar was made from tobacco leaves specially commissioned by the Agriculture Committee from Quake Qiong, imported from the West Indies. Its richness far exceeded the so-called "Early Clearing Version" from the early days.

He struck a match, lit the cigar, and began puffing clouds. But his eyes didn't leave the report.

That's when his secretary at the General Hospital walked in and quietly announced: a Senator from Propaganda wanted to see him.

"Must be Senator Ding. Please show him in."

The visitor was indeed Dingding, as Shi Niaoren had expected. What surprised him slightly was Dingding's speed—only 24 hours since the meeting. Apparently, he was an action-oriented man.

Dr. Shi didn't have a great impression of this person. He always felt that besides flapping his lips, Dingding just showed off with his tall foreign mare of a wife all day, very much in the "empty bombast" style.

"Minister Shi, the simplified general practitioner training program you introduced yesterday was truly creative—I really admire it!" Dingding sat down and immediately put a high hat on Shi Niaoren. "Calling it the new timeline's barefoot doctors, benefiting all life, would not be an exaggeration. I'm planning a series of special reports on this theme. For domestic audiences, I'll use 'Living in Australia-Song, Heart with the World' as the theme. For external audiences, I'll use 'Teaching and Healing, Curing and Saving'—highlighting the medical system's professional spirit of helping humanity. For the health of the vast people of the north, not hesitating to risk their lives going to the mainland to deliver medicine and treatment."

Shi Niaoren went through a string of "not at all, not at all" deflections, thinking these pen-pushers were really something—flattery and nonsense flowed as naturally as drinking water.

In the time that followed, Dingding didn't continue small talk but directly proposed his specific plan. This plan was actually only half of one. A complete training program should include at least three elements: "who teaches," "who's taught," and "what's taught." Dingding's plan actually only covered the first two; the last one he'd left completely blank for Shi Niaoren.

"This is a half-set, you know." Shi Niaoren smiled teasingly.

"I do the first half, you do the back half." Dingding's attention was all on the plan, apparently not catching Shi Niaoren's teasing undertone.

The Senate's medical service capability could roughly be divided into several tiers. The first tier was the Health Ministry's Lingao General Hospital, equivalent to Peking Union Medical College Hospital in the old timeline. By the make-do traverser standard, it had complete departments, full equipment, complete systems, and possessed this timeline's most precious medical asset: Senator physicians.

Besides providing for Senators and their families, this hospital mainly served the naturalized-citizen class—those receiving "wages" from the Senate's financial system. This included state-owned enterprise staff and workers, "military-government-education" personnel, and students studying in Education's directly affiliated schools in Lingao. Different levels of "publicly funded medical care" were enjoyed based on position and status.

It was also open to ordinary people, provided they could afford the fees. Since Lingao's wealthy had been growing exponentially in recent years, under Deng Bochuan's management, a "Premium Outpatient Clinic" was specially opened. Its revenue became one of Bairen General Hospital's main funding sources.

To balance outside criticism, Deng Bochuan also specially opened a "People's Clinic," providing low-cost or even free diagnosis and medicine. Most naturalized-citizen doctors' first job started here.

Next was the Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital in Guangzhou—which basically had the framework of a medical system, with some specialized equipment. Though medical personnel were mainly naturalized citizens, they were senior in tenure and mostly "direct disciples" trained by Senators. It could be considered having a relatively complete medical system framework. Senator physicians periodically rotated through for clinic duty, and medical training was also conducted—similar to old-timeline mega-tertiary hospitals like Xiangya.

Below that were military-system hospitals, with the vanguards being the Naval General Hospital in Kaohsiung and the Army General Hospital slated to move to Jeju Island. Though these two hospitals sounded impressive, they were actually just enhanced health stations. Now there were two more: the field hospitals dispatched from the Army General Hospital in Zhaoqing and Chaozhou. Facilities were even worse, but being at the front lines, they deployed elite troops and had Senator physicians rotating in. Though medical standards except for trauma emergency were relatively low, compared to Ming's dismal healthcare, they counted as regular tertiary-level.

Fourth tier: overseas stations at Hangzhou, Qimao Island, and Shengjing had only a few medics and nurses. But most stationed Senators had learned some basic medical knowledge—barely community health center level.

Fifth tier was quite chaotic. By the Senators' standards, it could no longer be called medical tier. The first four tiers at least had "medics" trained for a year and formally graduated "nurses." By the fifth tier, the backbone was the so-called "simplified general practitioners"—the old timeline's "barefoot doctors."

Dingding's plan was to use the third and fourth tier medical systems as a foundation, establishing training centers at each fixed military hospital and overseas station. Students would be locals willing to pay to learn—regardless of identity, as long as they could pay tuition, they'd be admitted. Teachers would mainly come from local medical departments; if necessary, rotating doctor dispatch from Lingao could provide reinforcement.

"...I think your simplified general practitioner setup is especially suitable! The scale can be much bigger. After all, before you were doing public-interest education; now you can have revenue."

The word "revenue" really moved Dr. Shi now. After all, maintaining Lingao General Hospital's consistently high standards, and spreading high standards to Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital—all required heaps of money...

As for "what to teach," this indeed didn't need Dingding the outsider meddling. In the past two years, Shi Niaoren's "Non-Professional Medical Common Knowledge Short Training Course" in Hainan—abbreviated as "Simplified General Practitioner Training Course"—had already gained considerable experience in training natives who had nothing but enthusiasm. According to region, *Common Disease Prevention and Treatment Manuals* were compiled. No need to instill professional medical knowledge—students just needed to match symptoms to solutions. If no match, send to hospital. Anyway, in this timeline, there was no such thing as illegal practice or medical negligence. Death was destiny; recovery was the Senate's glory shining everywhere. Based on the Guangzhou plague situation, much hygiene and epidemic prevention content had recently been added—like how to build latrines, how to purify water sources, and so on.

Based on accumulated experience, Shi Niaoren planned to have medical Senators already at the front compile Guangdong-Guangxi, Jiangnan, and Northern versions based on the Hainan *Common Disease Prevention and Treatment Manual*.

After tentatively setting the framework, the two chatted freely about details—how much force Lingao would dispatch, how many teachers the medical department needed to prepare, whether Senator inspections were required, fee standards, and so on. Dingding also promised that *Lingao Times* and other related media would have at least three positive reports about Health each month—thus confirming cooperation with the medical sector.

As Shi Niaoren walked Dingding out while chatting, he thought to himself: this guy definitely has an insider in Health. How else could he know the situation so thoroughly? Could it be that money-grubber Deng Bochuan?

On Dingding's side, he was half excited, half apprehensive. Excited that with Health's cooperation, the Cultural Strategy finally had something grounded. Apprehensive because the refugee screening, training venues, and logistics support he'd just promised were all empty promises—he'd have to go to the military and overseas stations waving Health's banner to beg.

Leaving Bairen General Hospital, Dingding crossed East Gate Market's busiest district heading straight for the Cooperative Society Restaurant. He'd arranged to meet Sikade at noon and was already a bit late. Dingding kept checking his watch, cursing East Gate Market's traffic, wishing he could grab a patrolman to clear the way.

The more anxious, the more mistakes. He accidentally took a wrong turn and walked further away. Finally spotting the Cooperative Society in the distance, his heart suddenly skipped—rushing over so frantically, what would Sikade think? Thinking this, Dingding couldn't help slowing down. After a few steps, he simply walked into a shop, bought a bottle of chilled Kvass, and leisurely sipped it.

When Sikade arrived at the Cooperative Society, it was already past the agreed time. He'd been thinking about how to explain to Dingding, but the Dingding who'd warmly invited him last night still hadn't arrived—leaving him rather displeased. Dingding left Sikade hanging for about ten minutes before walking in with an air of hurry, dropping several file folders with a clatter on an empty seat, then grabbing Sikade's hand with a stream of "so sorry" and "I'm late"—leaving Sikade thoroughly bewildered, the earlier displeasure forgotten before he could tease back.
