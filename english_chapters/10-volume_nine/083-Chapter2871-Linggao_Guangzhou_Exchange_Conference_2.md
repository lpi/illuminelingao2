# Chapter 2871: Lingao-Guangzhou Exchange Conference (2)

Fu Bu'er was currently sitting in the "Four Seas Pavilion," facing more than a dozen gentry from both Lingao and Guangzhou seated around a round table covered with an ornate gold-threaded tablecloth, feeling uncomfortable all over. Although bearing the title of "Progressive Gentry," in reality, he had nothing to do with "gentry"—he was a genuine local wealthy farmer. Under the Great Ming, these gentry from Guangzhou probably wouldn't even deign to look down their noses at him.

Although he was clear about his own status—being one of the "first on board," the Chiefs naturally "trusted" him more than these "latecomers"—facing this group of provincial city elite with their dignified bearing and refined conversation, he couldn't help feeling somewhat inferior, and his speech became less fluent.

The gentry in the private room were mostly engaged in industry and commerce. There wasn't a single pure farmer like him. After a few words of small talk, they had nothing more to say. Moreover, for the past few days, the Guangzhou gentry had been on "study tours," and everyone was meeting for the first time today. They couldn't even recall each other's names, so naturally, things turned cold. The gentry either half-closed their eyes pretending to rest, or discussed the merits and demerits of the plates and chopsticks on the table with their neighbors. Some even began studying the structure of peanuts in the cold appetizer dishes. Only when the serving girls floated lightly across the threshold did the gazes of the gentry, whose every gesture followed propriety, focus on the dishes the girls carried—or on other things near the dishes.

Today's cuisine was quite special. Since the Great Song's arrival, what had spread along with its thunderous reputation besides goods was cuisine. Lingao gentry were naturally familiar with Australian dishes, and even prominent figures in Guangzhou had long experienced Ziming Tower's "foreign dishes" like "Scrambled Eggs with Tomato" and "Stir-fried Cauliflower and Broccoli." Serving these again wouldn't win any favor. Therefore, for this banquet, Zheng Shangjie decided to innovate and introduce "Kaifeng Cuisine"—first, to add some novelty for the gentry, and second, to greatly promote it on this occasion, establishing "Kaifeng Cuisine" as upscale and fashionable.

Led by Mayor Qian, several Senators from the commercial, agricultural, and industrial sectors went to each private room to toast and express the Senate's sincere hope to support each other with all present and seek development together. Then, service staff in form-fitting dresses brought out large serving plates topped with domed metal covers. When the staff lifted the covers simultaneously, steaming vapor dispersed, and the curious items on the plates came into view—more than a dozen plates held various items, with a few large bowls of soup and the like. In one central plate, there was a heap of golden, glistening yellow chunks. Looking closely, they seemed to be fried, but the surface was studded with small, round flat pieces, completely different from ordinary fried food. Another plate held more than a dozen round cakes, flat on the bottom and round on top, with a dark brown layer sandwiched in the middle. A piece of emerald green lettuce poked out from the edges of the brown substance. In terms of form, it was somewhat similar to a stuffed bun, but what stuffed bun had its filling exposed? One gentleman at the table mentioned that in the northwest, there was a food called "Rou Jia Mo" (meat sandwich). Although he hadn't seen it personally, he had heard descriptions that were very similar to what was on the table. It was probably a type of meat sandwich, but he didn't know what the Australians meant by serving them this northwestern stuff.

The gentlemen looked at each other, no one wanting to pick up their chopsticks, only exchanging courtesies:

"Elder brother, please go first."

"Ah, worthy brother, please go first."

"Since ancient times, there has been an order by age and seniority. How dare I presume? Please, you first!"

"Not at all. Worthy brother, haven't you heard of the story of Boyi yielding to Shuqi? Please use your chopsticks first."

"Oh no, no. In ancient times, there was Kong Rong yielding pears. Today, please, elder brother, take the first bite!"

A table of rotund gentry exchanging courtesies, their enthusiasm was considerable, amusing the service staff standing by who covered their mouths and giggled, blushing several faces and widening several pairs of eyes.

Gao Ju, as the earliest Guangzhou gentry to follow the dragon, was also seated at the table today, subtly having become the head of the Guangzhou "Kun-gentry." Seeing this endless yielding getting nowhere, if the Australians got the wrong idea and became resentful, the consequences would be severe. Thinking of this, beads of sweat appeared faintly on Gao Ju's forehead—the Australians might well be deliberately testing those present.

Gao Ju straightened up and cleared his throat. The gentry at the table knew what was at stake and quickly stopped talking, looking to Gao Ju for his cue.

Only to hear Gao Ju cup his fists and speak loudly: "Everyone, we gentry and merchants of Lingao and Guangzhou, devoted to the Great Song, though residing in two places, share the same heart and mind. Our hearts are pure as ice, our loyalty undivided. To be graced with a banquet from our superiors today is truly a blessing cultivated over many lifetimes!"

"What Master Gao says is absolutely right!" The gentry at the table understood clearly. Each secretly alarmed in their hearts, they hurriedly agreed in unison.

Gao Ju continued: "Consider our Great Song, far away beyond thousands of miles of waves, a nation rich and abundant. Its cuisine is the pinnacle of the world's achievements!" At this point, Gao Ju raised his joined arms high, praying toward the heavens: "Long live our Great Song Emperor for ten thousand generations! Long life to Chairman Wang and State Councillor Ma! May District Chief Wen enjoy fortune and long life!" The gentry at the table hurriedly followed suit, bowing and praising endlessly.

After the prayer, Gao Ju steadily raised his chopsticks: "Everyone, this foolish elder will rely on his slight reputation and take the first bite." With that, he picked up a piece of the golden item, put it in his mouth, closed his eyes, and slowly chewed, not saying a word. The gentlemen, seeing Master Gao take the lead and not wanting to appear ungrateful and invite trouble, each shakily picked up a piece, timidly bit off a small mouthful, and swallowed it down as if drinking bitter medicine while pinching their noses. But after the item slid down their throats, a fresh fragrance welled up from their throats—this thing... was actually quite good! Having tasted the flavor, their courage grew, and the chopsticks gradually became more active.

Fu Bu'er was timid. Just now, while everyone was exchanging courtesies, he had cowered to the side. Others, seeing him neatly dressed but with a vulgar appearance, didn't want to engage with him. Only after everyone had started eating did he timidly pick up a piece from the edge of the plate and take a small bite. Unexpectedly, the moment the food entered his mouth, the rich fragrance of deep-frying, combined with the crispy texture of the coating, burst into his palate. Beneath the rich fragrance, a fresh sweetness lingered on the tip of his tongue, long refusing to dissipate. Fu Bu'er had been to fine restaurants in Lingao, but this texture was a first for him. After a few bites, Fu Bu'er's courage grew. Seeing others picking up the stuffed cakes to eat, he boldly reached out to pick one up. But the cake was big and hard to pick up with chopsticks. In his eagerness, Fu Bu'er simply reached out and grabbed it. Lin Quan'an, seated next to him, gave him a sidelong glance and cursed inwardly: *Country bumpkin!*

Fu Bu'er couldn't hear Lin Quan'an's silent ridicule. With the stuffed cake in his mouth, he felt very satisfied. The meat patty, rich in fat, and the bun base, brimming with the fragrance of grains, were enough to satisfy any medieval commoner's brain and stomach. As for the piece of lettuce on top, it was merely decorative.

Despite being the famous "farm owner" of Hainan, with multiple farms in northern Qiong and multiple tropical crop plantations in southern Qiong and the Wuzhi Mountain area—listed first on the agricultural sector's "Above-Scale Planting Enterprise" registry—Fu Bu'er still maintained the traditional farmer's "thrift and diligence" in his personal life and daily enjoyment. His everyday meals rarely included meat. Only during busy farming seasons did the food improve. When it came to various "Australian pleasures," he had actually experienced less than the Guangzhou elite who had come from afar.

Fu Bu'er bit into the stuffed cake while his eyes fixed on someone at the table picking up yellow strips and dipping them in a deep red sauce. He hesitated whether to swallow the cake first or pick up his chopsticks to grab some.

A scholar at the table intoned with swaying head: "Just now, Chief Xiong said this is Kaifeng Cuisine. This humble one hails from Kaifeng, yet I have never seen such dishes. I imagine our Great Song ancestors, residing myriad miles away, still harbored their ancestral temples in their hearts, thus naming it so, signifying never forgetting one's ancestors and society. Such loyalty truly inspires profound admiration!" Others echoed: "Indeed! Indeed!"

While everyone was praising, the door opened, and service staff filed in to deliver drinks. There was fine Lanling Wine and Guoshi Wushuang. Even the rarely seen Languiren and Princess Datang were among them—though there had long been rumors in Guangzhou that Princess Datang was brewed with rhubarb and was extremely laxative. Ordinary people dared not try it easily. It was said that red-haired foreigners overseas loved this wine tremendously, paying dozens of gold pieces for it. The common folk speculated that foreigners loved eating raw meat like "beef pie," which was hard to digest and must block their stomachs. Unable to defecate and bloated in agony, they relied on this strong wine to relieve themselves. Whenever this was discussed, everyone laughed and scorned.

Besides wine, several accompanying sweet drinks were sent in. There were rumors among the common folk that Australians called these "yin niao" (drink urine), making all who heard shake their heads and sigh at the Australians' utter crudeness for making such vulgar remarks without shame. However, a later expert in Australian studies pointed out this should be "yinliao" (beverages), meaning sweet drinks that were so delicious they were addictive. Pale yellow Kvass, dark red Kombucha, various fruit juices with colorful ingredients suspended in them, and especially eye-catching was a black liquid in a large crystal bottle—its color dark as ink, still as a deep pool, truly novel.

Fu Bu'er watched the girl delivering drinks place this large bottle of black water in front of him. She announced the drink names to everyone, and he learned this black water was "Cola."

Fu Bu'er had seen but never drunk this thing. It had only come out recently and was expensive; he was reluctant to drink it. Never mind this new thing—even Kvass and various sodas that had gradually become popularized locally, Fu Bu'er was usually reluctant to drink. When he saw the children drinking them, he would inevitably lecture them.

"Pop!" With a crisp sound, the girl deftly pried off the bottle cap, startling Fu Bu'er. Then, a fine "fizzing" sound reached his ears, making his teeth ache—the girl poured half a glass of black water into the transparent crystal glass in front of Fu Bu'er and said softly, "Please enjoy, sir," before moving on to serve others.

Fu Bu'er savored the girl's soft voice, carefully eyeing the tiny bubbles rising on the dark surface in the glass. These fine bubbles rose to the surface, creating the gentle rustling sound he had heard. The black water must have been chilled before serving, as the glass wall was beaded with condensation. Without even drinking it, one felt refreshed and cooled.
