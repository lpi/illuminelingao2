# Chapter 2841 The Matchmaking

"So it's you..." With the awkwardness of having discovered a little secret, Tan Shuangxi greeted Yang Zhaodi across the table. The conversation on East Gate Market streets a month ago was still fresh in both their minds.

"I didn't expect it either. Fourth Aunt didn't tell me." Yang Zhaodi's head was practically buried under the table, her two hands nervously tugging at her braids. Her words were full of embarrassment.

Carrying an unspeakable secret to meet a man who might become her future husband, and that man happened to know this secret—what could be more mortifying for a young woman?

Tan Shuangxi studied her. Yang Zhaodi had clearly dressed up today. She wasn't wearing that indigo work uniform, but a blue dress with white floral patterns. This Song-style women's wear had already become fashionable in Lingao. But Yang Zhaodi's tall figure was uncommon among local women, giving her a distinctive charm. A deep blue he'd never seen before—it set off her fairer-than-local-girls complexion. Her thick black hair was combed into a single large braid, with a red ribbon tied to it that swayed with Yang Zhaodi's movements, drawing Tan Shuangxi's gaze to follow involuntarily.

The matchmaker called Fourth Aunt smiled and said: "Since you two know each other, I don't need to make introductions. You chat first." She made some excuse and left her seat.

It was still a while before noon. This common teahouse was almost empty. To break the awkward atmosphere, Tan Shuangxi picked up the teapot and poured Yang Zhaodi a cup of tea, explaining: "I just started leave today. Originally was going to head home, but the battalion headquarters 'cared' enough to arrange this matchmaking. I just said I wasn't local—I really didn't know it would be you."

Without outsiders present, Yang Zhaodi's expression improved somewhat. She picked up the teacup and took a sip, still not daring to meet Tan Shuangxi's gaze. Head down, looking at the cup in her hands, she said: "The steel mill is transferring some people to Foshan, including my mother. She wants me to find a match before she leaves—preferably get married. That way she can rest easy."

"Your mom does mean well. But didn't you tell her about Brother Li?" Tan Shuangxi figured since there were no outsiders here, better to clear things up directly and avoid wasting more time being unclear.

"I told Mom. She disagreed. Said after Brother Li got wounded, who knows if he can do heavy work. And he's alone here with no family. Marrying him means immediately taking care of a cripple." Yang Zhaodi's eyes gradually reddened as she spoke. "Then I refused the matchmaking, and she hit me. Said I was being disobedient..." As she spoke, a teardrop fell from her eyes, wetting the front of her clothes. Tan Shuangxi's heart felt like a still water surface struck by raindrops, rippling with something unfamiliar.

"The Senate advocates freedom in love and marriage. No one, including parents, may interfere." Tan Shuangxi spoke righteously, then suddenly realized his voice was too loud and quickly lowered it. "Don't worry about this—the Senate can advocate for you."

Hearing this, Yang Zhaodi felt even more aggrieved. Tears fell like beads from a broken string. Slightly choked, she said: "The Senate? The Senate can't manage such small matters! When my mom hits me, the *paijia* just comes to persuade a bit, tells me to be obedient, says she means well for me."

"This is, this is..." Tan Shuangxi was somewhat flustered. Thinking about it, the Senators were each so busy with state affairs—how could they manage such trivial matters!

Seeing Yang Zhaodi's tear-stained face like a pear blossom in rain, with restaurant staff glancing their way from time to time, Tan Shuangxi couldn't sit still. His right hand reached back for the towel on his satchel strap, but felt nothing—today he was in civilian clothes, none of his usual belongings were with him. Just as he was at a loss, a bamboo clip holding a steaming white towel appeared before Tan Shuangxi. Looking up, he saw the restaurant worker watching him. He thought: this worker really has sharp eyes! He quickly thanked him and passed the towel over.

Yang Zhaodi took the towel and wiped her eyes, covered her face to calm down. Finally she raised her head and showed a smile through her tears. Tan Shuangxi felt like he'd been hit by a Minié ball—for a moment he had trouble breathing.

"How about I help talk to your mom? Or else, you and Brother Li are in a relationship—you could write to General Staff Political Department to appeal. The military will definitely handle it. Besides, Senate policy is freedom in love and marriage. No one can violate that. Whoever you like is up to you. Your mom has no right to interfere." Tan Shuangxi carefully offered his suggestions.

Yang Zhaodi gave a bitter smile. Bitterness and grievance hung at the corners of her eyes: "It's not about Mom anymore. A few days ago, Brother Li's comrade wrote a letter saying he's gotten together with a nurse at the hospital. I got beaten for nothing."

This unexpected twist surprised Tan Shuangxi too. He felt sympathy well up in his heart, and a trace of secret joy. His gaze followed Yang Zhaodi's tears as they fell from her cheeks onto her chest, dampening a patch of clothing. It also added some restlessness to Tan Shuangxi's feelings.

"You're seeing me make a fool of myself." Yang Zhaodi said with a bitter smile as she wiped her tears. "Mom says if she doesn't see me with a man, she won't let me go home. So I stayed in the farm dormitory and didn't go home. Then she came to the farm to lecture me, and even won over Fourth Aunt at the farm. Every day introducing matchmaking—I have no interest at all—I really don't want to marry so early." She had a thoroughly dispirited air.

Tan Shuangxi had been rather eager to express "I'm available too," but that enthusiasm immediately deflated. She'd just been crying so sadly about Brother Li, and now she'd shifted to not wanting to marry—women's hearts are like needles at the bottom of the sea.

"I'm currently studying for my Class-B diploma and also taking evening accounting classes." Yang Zhaodi hesitated a moment, then raised her head to look at Tan Shuangxi—her first time looking directly into his eyes today. "I think I can pass. Really. Ever since I started working at the farm and attending night school, I realized there are so many things in the world more interesting than getting married. Like when the farm plants new crops, they take soil to the lab for testing, then the lab tells us what fertilizer to add. Sometimes you need to add lime too, but everything grows well. Isn't that strange... And soil is divided into acidic and alkaline. I secretly tasted some but couldn't taste any sourness. Director Wu found out and laughed so hard..."

As she spoke, a kind of light flickered in her eyes.

"With a Class-B diploma, plus an accounting certificate, it's very easy to find work. I heard from the farm clerk that with these, it's not hard to find bookkeeping work at any factory or big shop. The income would be much better than now. And not so tiring. I've seen the accounting books my mom keeps—they're simpler than what we learn in accounting class."

She grew more excited as she spoke: "If I stay at the farm, management says with this certificate I could transfer to the Finance Office or Administration. No more fieldwork every day. I'd be a 'cadre.' If willing to transfer to farms in other counties, I could even get promoted quickly!"

Her eyes were shining as she spoke, full of longing. Once away from the topic of romance, Yang Zhaodi became talkative, chattering away about interesting stories from the farm and night school like a child on their first trip far from home. Tan Shuangxi watched her excited expression and felt happy for her. Life wasn't just about Brother Li—there was a broader world.

"...Shuangxi-ge, what diploma did you get? Must be Class-A, right?"

"Me? I haven't even passed Class-B yet!" Tan Shuangxi shook his head helplessly. "This leave, I'm thinking of working hard to get the diploma. Then I can become a candidate officer."

"What's a candidate officer?" Yang Zhaodi asked curiously.

"It means once there's an officer vacancy, you can fill it and become an officer."

"Oh my, then you'd be a proper official." Yang Zhaodi was delighted. "Let's work hard together!"

Tan Shuangxi chuckled. He really liked Yang Zhaodi's innocent manner. He took a sip of tea and felt his stomach was empty—only then did he realize it was almost lunchtime. He asked:

"It's almost noon. Let's eat something here to fill our stomachs."

"Mm."

Tan Shuangxi ordered two bowls of wontons. Only then did Yang Zhaodi realize she'd been doing all the talking. A bit embarrassed, she tossed the topic to Tan Shuangxi: "Shuangxi-ge, was your matchmaking arranged by your family too?"

"Mine was arranged by the Political Department." Tan Shuangxi said. "The battalion clerk delivered the letter—that's how I found out."

"The military is quite caring."

"Yes." Tan Shuangxi hesitated a moment. "Actually, I don't want to get married so quickly either."

"Oh? Why not?" Yang Zhaodi was immediately interested.

"Sigh." Tan Shuangxi sighed, then told her everything about delivering death notifications since his return: first about Hu Weide and Tan Haonan's wives... finally about Li Anze's sister.

As they talked, the worker brought the two bowls of wontons. This was also a "traditional" snack that had only recently become popular.

"I can't eat this much." Yang Zhaodi scooped several wontons from her bowl with a spoon and put them in Tan Shuangxi's bowl.

This was quite an intimate gesture. Tan Shuangxi's heart stirred again, but thinking about what he'd just said, his heart sank again.

He added a spoonful of chili to his bowl—a new habit he'd developed in the military. It made everything taste better. He hesitated, thinking about how to express his meaning to Yang Zhaodi without causing misunderstanding.

"Being a soldier means going to war. No matter how Fubo Army wins every battle, there are still casualties. When civilians welcome us home in triumph, transport ships are unloading shipload after shipload of wounded at Maniao. Never mind those who don't come back—they all become death notifications. Once on the battlefield, weapons strike without discrimination. No matter who you are, even the greatest hero, if hit by bullets or shells, you'll be at death's door—and most likely won't come back."
