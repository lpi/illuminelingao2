# Chapter 2798: Affairs Between Men and Women

Tan Shuangxi followed the voice to find the person in the crowd. He saw Yang Zhaodi from the same village. She and her mother Zhang Lai'er were immigrants from Shandong several years ago. He had met them a few times when returning to the village during holidays. Actually their relationship could only count as acquaintances, but seeing a familiar person at this moment, Tan Shuangxi still felt very happy.

Yang Zhaodi had looks completely different from local girls. Though only thirteen or fourteen years old, she was almost catching up to Tan Shuangxi's height. She wore a large straw hat, dressed in a faded Year One Type training uniform—such attire showed at a glance she was a farm worker. The face under the straw hat was not the black of local girls due to long-term sun exposure, but a good-looking honey color. Tan Shuangxi's heart couldn't help moving—less than two years, this little girl grew so watery (fresh and beautiful)!

Yang Zhaodi didn't know Tan Shuangxi's thoughts, only the joy of seeing an acquaintance. She squeezed through the crowd to grab his sleeve, shaking excitedly, two big watery eyes scanning his face and body continuously.

"It's really you! We even bet whether we could meet!"

"Why did you come? No school?" Tan Shuangxi's gaze slipped back and forth on the girl several times. This girl developed really well! Especially...

Yang Zhaodi said excitedly: "I already graduated from higher primary school! Didn't pass the middle school exam, went to agricultural technology night school. Now at Nanbao Tropical Crops Farm. Today farm staff are all on holiday to welcome you." Yang Zhaodi said excitedly.

"Your father and mother? Also moved to Nanbao?" Tan Shuangxi was somewhat surprised, because Yang's parents were both workers under Manya Iron and Steel Complex; income was much higher than working on the farm.

"They won't go!" Yang Zhaodi made a funny face, "They are going north soon. Heard going to Foshan—going to build a bigger steel plant!"

"Really?" Tan Shuangxi was very surprised. Not surprised hearing they were going to Foshan, but the family was about to separate, and Yang Zhaodi was actually grinning heartlessly like a flower. Besides, a thirteen or fourteen-year-old girl working alone in a strange place, Yang family parents could really rest assured!

"Your brother?" He remembered Yang Zhaodi had a brother.

"He originally was going to Danzhou. But later was persuaded by someone so didn't go..." Yang Zhaodi lowered her voice, looked around, whispered, "I only tell you because we are good. Never go to Danzhou side for recruitment. Don't go no matter how high the wages are. Many work injuries."

"Really?!" Tan Shuangxi was startled, because not long ago the company received a soldier discharged due to injury. His letter said he went to Danzhou for recruitment.

"More than the steel plant?"

"Hmm... Not allowed to say." Yang Zhaodi said looking around again, "Brother Shuangxi, you must not speak randomly outside."

"Know, know. We understand discipline! Just know among ourselves. Then where did your brother go?"

"He also prepares to go to Foshan. Chief said, Foshan side wants to launch many projects. Just don't know if safe or not..."

Tan Shuangxi immediately comforted her: "Foshan was peacefully recovered, didn't fight at all. Now still have National Army garrisoned. Very safe..." Suddenly he thought of something again, "Your house at Manya side?"

"Rented to new immigrants." Yang Zhaodi grinned, "They came from the mainland; we go to the mainland. Really interesting!"

Tan Shuangxi suddenly reacted. She definitely had some other important words to say. So stopped talking to look. Heart couldn't help pitter-pattering, nervous and a bit expectant.

Yang Zhaodi changed her previous articulateness. Opened mouth but said nothing. Looking at Yang Zhaodi's expression of wanting to speak but stopping, Tan Shuangxi's heart was almost flying out. Attacking the mountain top under Ming army artillery fire in Chaozhou, raiding Guilin late at night in Guangxi, none were so nervous.

"Brother Shuangxi, I want to ask..." Yang Zhaodi became shy, voice smaller and smaller, "Little Brother Li of our village, also in your battalion that one, my Shandong fellow villager. I didn't see him? Did I miss him?"

Tan Shuangxi was drenched by a bucket of cold water through the heart. Didn't recover for a while. Stuttering in mouth not knowing what to say. Seeing Tan Shuangxi's expression twisted and awkward, Yang Zhaodi's face twitched. Involuntarily covered mouth with hand. Panic flashed in eyes. Watching tears about to fall.

Fortunately at this moment Tan Shuangxi had concealed his loss of composure, hurriedly said: "He, he is still alive. Just got poked here a bit..." Saying, gestured on his own abdomen.

"...But person is fine. Did surgery. Now still recuperating in the hospital in Hong Kong. Heavy injury needs recuperation for a month or two no matter what. He can come back in some days." Finished saying, hurriedly gestured the direction of team movement, meaning he had to catch up with the team. Ran away hurriedly. While running, cursed secretly in heart: "Still pretty boys are good. Actually hurt like that still have women missing him. Why didn't that knife go a bit lower."

Bairen Grand Stadium exposed problems of rough early design and construction during the celebration ceremony of the Second Counter-Encirclement Campaign and subsequent various "Salt Field Cup" rugby matches and regional football leagues. Audience seats were too close to the inner field; vertical height difference insufficient; rear row audience vision very bad. And the bigger problem was the rostrum piled up with earth lacked majesty. Later maintenance was also particularly troublesome. Always danger of collapse after rainy season.

Borrowing this troops' triumphant return welcome ceremony, the Senate approved a budget to reconstruct the Grand Stadium. The stands were changed to a circle of two-story buildings, equivalent to building sloped stands on the roof of the first floor. The rostrum and extended double wings were one floor higher than other stands.

The center of the rostrum was raised by half a floor, arranging the speaker's position. Speaking here could overlook the whole field, enjoying cheers and worshipping gazes exclusively. On both sides of the speaker were sections of seats. Senators who didn't need to stick to posts sat upright, putting on the air of heads of state at the Olympic Opening Ceremony as much as possible. However, not every Senator liked to take the serious and earnest route. A batch of soy sauce (bystander) Senators just made token gestures while starting to gossip in low voices.

The content of gossip was mainly "Peace Talks" and personnel arrangements after "Peace Talks." This was also the problem Senators cared about most.

Said wanted peace talks, but peace didn't truly descend. The General Staff was still compiling operational plans, including defensive and counter-attacking ones.

Although peace talks hadn't even the first stroke of the character "eight" (were far from realization), rumors and slanders about peace talks were flying all over the sky. From the mode of reaching peace talks to what new situation peace talks might bring... various kinds, countless. Among them the most widely spread and most intensely discussed was "Marriage Alliance Theory."

Regarding the saying of "Marriage Alliance," actually origin was long. Earliest was You the Tiger saying in the Officer Club of Nanhai Coffee House: "Want peace talks, Daddy only has one condition! Must marry a princess."

This originally counted as one of You the Tiger's life ideals. Unexpectedly a joking remark spread more and more miraculously, with more and more details. Developed to now, besides "Once peace talks succeed, Chongzhen will choose a daughter of the imperial clan to marry to President Wen / Secretary of State Ma / Engineer Wang in the name of princess," unexpectedly legends of "Chongzhen desires to take Kun women as Imperial Concubines to show sincerity of peace talks" also appeared.

Naturally, this couldn't count as completely groundless.

Because the *Monthly Intelligence Summary* sent from the Capital Station mentioned: The Ming Court had decided to increase Yue Xiang tax, determining the policy of "Suppression" in the general direction. Then a Feudal Prince submitted a memorial: True Kun lived overseas for long, returned for many years but didn't submit memorial to attach internally. Although arrogant and rebellious, after all are Huaxia descendants. Request the Emperor to recruit True Kun surrenderers while suppressing Kun. Kun Thieves are good at instrument manufacturing, accumulating wealth sources, gathering with methods. Exactly talents urgently lacked by the Celestial Dynasty. Chooses places to settle. Then invite the Emperor to take one or two Kun women as harem concubines to settle the hearts of people coming from overseas.

This kind of memorial nearing bullshit, from Emperor to ministers, no one in the court took it seriously. The Capital Station just treated it as material, placing it in the *Compilation of Memorials of This Month* in the report appendix. Unexpectedly arriving at Lingao it became a hot spot instead. Spread vividly, saying Senate heads already reached preliminary agreement, preparing to use the method of "Marriage Alliance" to strive for "Peace Talks." Even the girls to go for marriage alliance were already circled for several. Among them ranking first was Zhang Yunmi. Other candidates included her best friend Lin Ziqi, Qian Duoduo... Even Zhong Xiaoying, who strictly speaking didn't count as a Little Senator, also became a member of the list.

For a time, Senator families with daughters above thirteen or fourteen were in panic, rushing to find the General Office to "demand explanation." Xiao Zishan was muddled for a while, thinking where did this brain hole come from. Could only pat chest to guarantee "Absolutely no such thing." Finally even specially let Wang Luobin write an article, published related article on discussion of peace talks in *Weekly News*, specifically stating attitude on this issue, expressing absolutely no such thing. Only then did this matter gradually subside.

At this moment, on the Senator seats beside the rostrum, someone was indignant for Little Senator Zhang who once became a hot figure.

Zhang Berlin asked tentatively: "Chief Secretary Dong, heard yet?"

"Heard what?" Dongmen guessed a few directions in heart for a moment, "That marriage alliance stuff again? It's just bullshit..."

"I also know it's bullshit. It's about her personal problem."

"Understood." Dongmen understood what he wanted to say. Thinking you really never forget, thief heart undying.

"I heard rumors saying Little Zhang... and Mayor Liu have very close relationship. That kind of close." Zhang Berlin's expression was somewhat twisted.

Dongmen understood which kind the "close" he said was. Learned back a bit: "Where did you hear this from?"

"A few days ago I went to the city to handle affairs. In the Great World area. Heard from the chat of two who should be local cadres."

"So you think this matter is true?"

Zhang Berlin shook his head, "I'm not sure. After all this is too, too..."

Spoke hesitantly, very lacking confidence.
