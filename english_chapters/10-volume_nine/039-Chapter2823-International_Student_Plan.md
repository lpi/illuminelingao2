# Chapter 2823 International Student Plan

"Let me add to your plan." Surprisingly, Wu De was the first to speak with an affirmative tone. "Expanding personnel exchange is definitely the right direction. But you need to consider how people will travel—by land or by sea. As long as we can provide safe transportation, personnel exchange will naturally increase. Otherwise, your plan is just a castle in the sky. I've thought it over roughly. Currently, there are several routes from Ming into our territory: from Guangxi via Lingchuan Road, from Shaoguan via Xijing Road, from Nanxiong via Wujing Road, from Chaozhou via Qilin Road, from Lianzhou via Dongpo Road. Which do you think is fast and convenient for people coming and going? None of these routes is both fast and safe. A poor student who reads your propaganda and comes by land takes at least half a year to reach Guangzhou. Only our ships are fastest. If you get the transportation lines working, that beats everything. People have legs. If our side has a way to live and money to earn, and the road isn't hard—then when you publicize, people will come. Shouldn't your plan consider transportation together? For example, opening some regular passenger ships, running along the West River, along the coastline. How exactly to run them and publicize—you can discuss with Dabo Shipping."

Wu De's suggestion was indeed down-to-earth, essentially correct truisms. Currently, land routes were indeed unsafe—never mind Ming-controlled areas; even entering Senate-controlled territory, some sections required organized escort. The bandit problem hadn't been completely solved—progress was only notable near major cities and transport routes. After Ming's postal station system collapsed, the Senate hadn't had time to implement a replacement.

Though truisms, they affirmed the direction of Dingding's plan. Dingding nodded repeatedly, writing something continuously in his notebook. Sikade's product placement had inspired Dingding: if this plan could form interest relationships with other departments, more people would support its passage. So he quickly followed up on Wu De's words: "Thank you for Ade's suggestion. I'll refine this direction when I get back—wherever we place study-abroad advertisements, we'll coordinate passenger route openings."

"Study abroad, study abroad—what autumn dreams are you all having!" Hu Qingbai sneered. "We're not the Unemployed Alliance with severe higher education surplus, running study-abroad economics wholesaling water degrees. Study abroad—do we have the faculty? Do we have the campus buildings? The hole in Guangdong's basic education isn't even filled yet!"

He'd never thought much of Dingding and now took the opportunity to vent: "The teacher shortage is especially severe; Senator teachers are even scarcer resources. You don't think Ming's international students are coming to learn elementary math and reading comprehension, do you? Though I don't know their thinking exactly, based on current practice, the main body of international students should be Ming's minor intellectuals. Their knowledge demands are either at a certain level, wanting further clarification; or leaning toward practical technologies, hoping to get rich through them. This content is exactly what our mass-produced junior primary school female teachers cannot provide."

As the receiving unit for international students, the Culture Ministry's statement naturally carried the most authority. Dingding could only listen attentively.

"Our teacher resources are not only tight, but structurally tight. Over the years, we've vigorously promoted faculty building. We can now basically meet junior primary school staffing, but overall, naturalized-citizen teachers competent for upper primary instruction are still severely insufficient. Except for Fangcaodi, no complete primary school has full staffing for upper-grade teachers. As for higher-level Senator teachers, except for us in Education and a few in research and industrial fields still teaching, they've basically disappeared. I personally believe we're unable to receive international students—of course, if relevant departments can provide faculty, I won't object."

Dingding was prepared for Hu Qingbai's pushback. He'd already researched this matter.

"Opening an international student program doesn't mean they all have to come to Lingao. We can also open schools in Ming territory." Dingding said. "For example, international high schools."

"International high schools don't need teachers? We're an education power after all; people who can be teachers are a dime a dozen. What faculty can Ming provide us?"

Dingding quickly waved his hands: "What I mean is, we don't run full-time schools, but short-term training courses. Our overseas stations are already running training courses, so why can't we expand them with more functions? For example, Health."

His words startled Shi Niaoren, who'd been sipping tea and daydreaming. What does this have to do with me?

"Old Shi, Dr. Shi, how many batches has your barefoot doctor training course graduated?"

Shi Niaoren had actually come to lobby for budget. Liu Muzhou had drafted him for this meeting, so he hadn't listened to what Dingding said at all. Hearing this sudden question, he couldn't react for a moment and hesitated: "One batch graduates every six months, rolling training. Over forty batches, I suppose. The results are pretty good. Of course, complicated cases definitely can't be handled—better than nothing, you know."

Dingding laughed heartily: "I remember your simplified general practitioner training course has been fully localized. Finding a few people to run it in Ming territory shouldn't be difficult, right? Like you said, these doctors are 'better than nothing,' but where does Ming have grassroots healthcare now? When your doctors cure a disease, commoners will say Australia-Song is good. If someone dies, they'll just say the skill wasn't quite there. The influence of medical services is incomparable to other propaganda. Didn't Fu Daoist become a living immortal in Shandong with just some traditional medicine knowledge plus Australian secret medicines? Look at that fake medicine case—the criminal gang made a fortune just selling our medicine dregs. Our general practitioners, working on two fronts—won't every single one be Hua Tuo reborn..."

"You have a point!" Shi Niaoren nodded. If you asked which study-abroad discipline was attractive, "medicine" was definitely one of the hottest. Based on experience implementing barefoot doctor training in Hainan, the Health Department used a circuit training method: training lecturers taught and saw patients in one place for about ten days, then moved to the next point. After one or two months, they circled back, checking what cases had come up in actual work, then stayed a few days or a couple weeks depending on the situation for lectures. The so-called six months per batch actually meant only twenty or thirty days physically present at one location teaching. If this model was scaled up, a medical ship shuttling between Jeju Island, Dengzhou, Hangzhou, and Kaohsiung was entirely feasible. People could even be taken to Kaohsiung Hospital for internships, and when necessary, these barefoot doctors could be conscripted as emergency medics for the northern war.

Though Dingding's picture was nicely drawn, Dr. Shi still asked cautiously: "Can the relevant funding be secured?"

"Are you worried about funding?" Dingding said. "International students pay tuition. I have no objections about this money..." He looked toward Hu Qingbai.

Hu Qingbai immediately stated that besides collecting "registration fees" and "administrative fees" per capita, all remaining tuition would go to Health Department revenue.

"This could be considered." Dr. Shi nodded, indicating "tentative basic agreement."

With Health taking the lead, Dingding struck while the iron was hot. He suggested that to adapt to "industrial diffusion" principles, they imitate Japan's "trainee" system and massively recruit "technical trainees," letting wealthy types interested in opening Australian-style factories send workers to Lingao for internships when purchasing technology. Naturally, such internships would be paid.

"...Originally when they purchased technology, we had to provide technical training work anyway. Technical trainees don't add much workload but do add income. Additionally, we can attract some craftsmen with modest savings to bring their own provisions to learn skills. This benefits the diffusion of our small-scale industrial equipment."

...

The Cultural Infiltration Strategy was thus passed by the Central Council of State. For a "strategy" requesting no budget, only red-headed documents, the leaders had no motivation to obstruct. It also obtained oral "commitments" from several departments.

Dingding left the conference room clutching his documents. Today's meeting could be called a success, but he always felt something was missing. Chewing over the taste, it was "not quite right."

He was about to leave when Ma Qianzhu called from behind. The two circled back to the conference room and sat down. The conference room that had been crowded moments ago now seemed empty, with only crooked chairs and open-lidded teacups remaining.

Ma Qianzhu seemed to sense Dingding's melancholy and warmly patted his shoulder, saying affectionately: "Too many people just now—too many cooks. Some things couldn't be said too clearly. Now there's no one—talk about your ideas again."

With surging emotions, Dingding immediately summarized his plan again, especially the concept of "cultural transmission." Then somehow slid into complaining, how he'd painstakingly conducted deep investigations among naturalized citizens, made a great strategic plan, but didn't get the results he wanted. And the "International Student Plan" could only "compromise," starting only from "Industrial" and "Medical" channels. The "Basic Sciences" and "Arts" he'd originally pinned hopes on had also been approved, but without an operational department taking over, they were as good as worthless paper.

"...Of course, I acknowledge there are objective difficulties, but we can't negate subjective initiative just because there are objective difficulties!"

"You're thinking of pushing a wave of cultural products this year and having Ming commoners overthrow Old Zhu next year? The US took nearly thirty years to bring down the Soviets. Cultural strategy is inherently a long-game project. If you're this eager to show results, that's probably unrealistic." Ma Qianzhu stubbed his cigarette in the ashtray and looked at Dingding.
