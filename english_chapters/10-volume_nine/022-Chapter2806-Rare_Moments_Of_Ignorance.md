# Chapter 2806 Rare Moments Of Ignorance

Tan Shuangxi continued to speak: "It was very chaotic when the night raid happened. We were all firing in the direction of the bandits. We only heard him cry out 'Ouch.' By the time we found him, he was already gone."

"Did he bleed a lot?" she asked in a husky voice.

"Didn't bleed much. A feathered arrow hit his chest, almost right at the heart. We gathered around him; he gasped for a moment and left. He didn't suffer." As if trying his best to comfort her, Tan Shuangxi added, "Although his service time wasn't too long, he performed very bravely. He received two Second Class Courage Medals and one Second Class Distinguished Service Medal, and was commended in general orders by the South China Army..."

"But he's gone," she said. "Never coming back."

No one could speak. Tan Shuangxi looked powerlessly at the medal box on the table. Yes, he was never coming back. What use was giving his wife more medals? These medals would not be worn on their owner's chest to show off his bravery and distinguished military service...

"Please restrain your grief and take care of yourself." Tan Shuangxi stood up and saluted again. "We are leaving."

Coming out of Tan Haonan's house, the *Paijia* invited them to eat. Tan Shuangxi refused; this was a town with restaurants as numerous as cattle hair, unlike the countryside where they had to rely on the village head to assign meals.

"Let's find a place to have a drink," Tan Shuangxi said.

"That woman..." Zhang Laicai said somewhat impatiently, "Unruly!" His voice was a bit loud. After blurting it out, he hurriedly looked around to see if he had disturbed others, then said indignantly: "There were men's things in her room!"

Tan Shuangxi didn't speak. After a long while, he opened his mouth: "A man's hat doesn't prove anything..."

"A hat really doesn't prove anything, but did you see the things in the kitchen sink?" Zhang Laicai said angrily. "Bowls, chopsticks, spoons, and cups were all in pairs! Why would she wash tableware for two living alone? And the unfinished food in the kitchen was all carefully prepared—don't tell me the man who came was her relative... even if it was her relative..."

He didn't continue; intermarriage between cousins wasn't rare.

"Even if a man visited, it doesn't prove anything, right?" Tan Shuangxi comforted. "The Great Ming Law requires catching adulterers in pairs. You only saw these few things; you can't catch a fart!"

"That man was upstairs!" Zhang Laicai said. "Didn't you hear the noise on the floorboards?"

"I'm hungry. Hurry up and find a place to eat." Tan Shuangxi interrupted his grumbling and dragged him into a small restaurant by the street.

It wasn't lunch time yet, and the shop was empty. The boss cheered up seeing two soldiers enter—recently many returning soldiers had come, sharing the characteristic of being generous and loose with money; they were good customers. He hurried to greet them.

"Comrades, what will you have?"

"Do you have a private room?" Tan Shuangxi knew Zhang Laicai was full of anger and had to vent it; they needed a safe place for him to let it out.

"Yes, yes, just that the conditions are average. Please forgive us; the small shop isn't a big establishment..."

"As long as you have it, cut the crap!"

The boss hurriedly ordered the shop assistant to take them to a private room in the back. The conditions were indeed average; apart from being an independent space, it was no different from the outside. But Tan Shuangxi was satisfied. "This is it."

"What will you two eat..."

"Bring four refreshing cold dishes to go with wine, and half a dozen 'Wenlan River' beers!" Tan Shuangxi ordered four cold dishes like salted peanuts and marinated jellyfish, then asked, "I saw you hanging a sign for Dongshan Mutton outside. Is it authentic?"

"Look at you, comrade," the boss immediately switched to dialect accent. "I'm from Wanning. Can it be inauthentic? Everything is raised by my family back home! Sent alive to Lingao, freshly butchered only yesterday!"

"Bring two *jin* of boiled sliced mutton, skin on!" Tan Shuangxi said. "And a plate of stir-fried lamb tripe!"

"Okay, okay," the boss nodded repeatedly, then whispered, "The shop has fresh sheep testicles (*yangbao*). Do you two want a portion? Guaranteed to be good for you!"

"Is it gamey?"

"The shop has a secret recipe; absolutely not gamey."

"Bring a portion," Tan Shuangxi said.

"Coming right up!"

Zhang Laicai waved his hands repeatedly: "Brother Shuangxi! You don't have a woman at home; why eat this? No, no."

"I don't need it, but you do. Aren't you going to meet your lover after delivering the letters?"

"What lover? I have absolutely zero interest now." Zhang Laicai sighed. "Seeing Brother Haonan's end, my heart is really chilled..."

As they were talking, the shouts of the waiter came from outside. Soon, wine and dishes were all set.

"The sheep testicles are stewing in the pot; they'll be ready soon." The boss greeted. "Do you want staples?"

"Not for now." Tan Shuangxi sent the boss away. Zhang Laicai finally couldn't hold back and asked, "Brother Shuangxi! I don't understand why you wanted to protect her! She is stealing a man! The adulterer is upstairs. With the *Paijia* as a witness, we should have rushed up and caught the adulterers on the spot!"

"Do you think this man was waiting on the bed bare-assed for us to catch him?" Tan Shuangxi said leisurely.

"Even if dressed, a lone man and widow in a room together, plus evidence of eating and drinking together, if not adultery, what is it?" Zhang Laicai said indignantly. "Catch him and beat him half to death first. Even if the police station can't convict him, it would vent this anger for Brother Haonan!"

"You know too that you can't convict him." Tan Shuangxi said. "Yes, you beat the man, you feel satisfied. But Tan Haonan's green hat would be solidly worn—not only worn, but everyone in Bairen would know. Besides, what if there's no such thing at all? Maybe it was a relative, maybe a neighbor, or maybe a messenger she kept to chat with! She is a woman, not a prisoner."

Zhang Laicai thought about it; it was indeed true. But he still couldn't swallow this anger and said resentfully: "I've seen Chiefs wear that hat. No matter how rich Tan Haonan's family is, he wouldn't buy it! This adulterer's family is very rich! Brother Haonan fought in the front, and she messed around with someone in the rear! She sure knows how to pick people..."

"I dare not say whether she messed around or not, but her feelings for Brother Haonan were genuine. I could see that."

"When did you become so knowledgeable about women?" Zhang Laicai said sullenly.

"Yeah, how could I understand?" Tan Shuangxi thought silently. Before leaving the army, better not think about getting married. He didn't want the day to come when his woman would cry holding a piece of paper. Men shouldn't be like that.

"Brother Haonan is already gone; do you want him to become gossip behind people's backs now?" Tan Shuangxi saw him still sulking and persuaded him.

"True," Zhang Laicai deflated. "Making a scene would be too ugly."

Tan Shuangxi picked up a piece of jellyfish skin and put it in his mouth: "In the end, Brother Haonan knows nothing anymore. The living have to continue living. I spent more time with Brother Haonan; I know a bit about their couple's affairs: she treated Haonan really well, not fake affection..."

He remembered Tan Haonan mentioning that almost all his wages were used to buy books, newspapers, and stationery. Just the postage for submitting articles and writing letters to literary friends cost a lot every month, and his wife never complained.

"...The key is she understands me, do you get it? She knows what I think and what I want. Being with her is a tacit understanding; I feel particularly comfortable..."

Recalling these words of Tan Haonan, Tan Shuangxi couldn't quite understand what "understand me" meant, but he could understand this "brother's" mood.

Did she really mess around? He didn't want to believe it, but what Zhang Laicai said was irrefutable. Since they were so affectionate, why would another man intervene...

Zhang Laicai gulped down wine and said, "I don't care if the affection is fake or not, I just... just feel Brother Haonan was so wronged!" He tore open the chest lapel of his uniform as he spoke. "Just thinking for him makes me feel blocked up."

"Stop thinking about it. There are plenty of things you can't figure out. If you think about everything, won't you stifle yourself to death?"

As they spoke, the waiter shouted and brought a steaming small clay pot. He whispered, "Stewed sheep testicles, you two eat while it's hot."

Lifting the lid, inside was white thick soup sprinkled with green garlic leaves. The translucent sheep testicles trembled in the simmering thick soup. Indeed, as the owner said, there was no fishy smell at all, only a strong aroma.

"Come eat. After eating, go meet your lover tonight." Tan Shuangxi comforted. "If you're tired, have a good sleep. There's still work to do tomorrow."

Suddenly, the sound of military music played by flutes and drums came from outside, along with the noisy cheers of many people. The two looked at each other. Tan Shuangxi called the waiter: "What's happening outside?"

"The local *jia* is sending off new recruits!"

The two left their wine glasses and went out to watch. On the street, military drums and flutes were playing the "Farewell March." Amidst the rousing march, a crowd clustered around several young men wearing "Year One Pattern" military uniforms without rank or branch insignia. Someone held a banner reading: "Farewell to East Gate Town 17th Jia 3rd Pai..." followed by probably a few names.

Under the banner were three young men with shy smiles—they probably had never been so glorious in their lives. Flags flew over their heads. The prominent figures of the street—the president of the *Paijia* chamber of commerce, the *Pai* head and *Jia* head, the president of the *Paijia* women's association—all came to see them off. People waving flowers and small flags cheered for them. Police cleared the way in front. Passing citizens cheered for them, some throwing confetti. They tried hard to look brave and fearless, walking to the beat of the march.

Seeing two Fubo Army soldiers by the street, the three young men suddenly stopped together and saluted them unevenly. Tan Shuangxi and Zhang Laicai hurried to return the salute together.

"Serve the Senate and the People!" "Restore China!"... With the loud slogans, the music rang out again, and the farewell procession continued to move forward.
