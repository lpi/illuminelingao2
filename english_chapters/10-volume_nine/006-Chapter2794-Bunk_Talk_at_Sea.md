# Chapter 2794: Bunk Talk at Sea

When Tan Shuangxi woke up, the sky was not yet bright. Although relying on the biological clock trained by his more than five years of service life, he could judge it was about less than five o'clock now, and in about ten minutes or so, the reveille would sound.

Once the reveille sounded, get up to organize internal affairs (housekeeping), then follow the assembly bugle to run to the drill ground, assemble and roll call. The thunder-cannot-move daily life of the military camp would begin. But today it wasn't needed; he could sleep until the meal bell rang. Originally wanted to sleep a while longer, but after turning over a few times, he couldn't fall asleep no matter what. The constantly swaying bed, the noisy sea waves, and the creaking sounds emitted by ship planks from time to time rising here and subsiding there, really couldn't count as a place suitable for sleeping. If not for the swaying and wet deck disgusting him more, he would be more willing to get up and move about. The usually daunting five kilometers, now he inexplicably missed them a bit.

The air in the ship cabin was foul and humid. A hurricane lamp hanging on the beam swaying with the ship emitted weak light. Looking out, everything was blurred.

Judging from the sounds of coughing, yawning, farting, and sighing rising and falling around, most people were already awake—as long as one stayed in the army for a year, this damn biological clock was considered set.

Tan Shuangxi looked around. Most people were like him, opening eyes staring at the deck overhead after waking up, or just closing eyes turning over and over.

The corporal in the neighboring bunk tilted his head to glance at Tan Shuangxi, "What? Can't sleep?"

"Yeah." Tan Shuangxi reached out to touch the cigarettes in the pocket of the military uniform hanging by the bed, only then remembering smoking was strictly prohibited on the ship, so he had to pat it, "How many days have we been drifting?"

The company boarded the ship from Hong Kong. It was already the fourth day. The weather was good all the way, not encountering any violent storms. Only on the second day of sailing, the wind and waves became larger, and soldiers began to get seasick and vomit. Because the wind and waves became larger, the time for going up to the deck for fresh air was also cancelled. Soldiers could only sleep, chat, and play cards under the deck where the air was foul and dark. Every one was almost suffocated into illness.

"Rest assured, definitely can arrive at Lingao today." The corporal said, "When we set out, it took four days. When landing in Hong Kong, it was exactly afternoon."

The whole company landing in Hong Kong was already a matter of nearly two years ago, but the memory was clear as if it was just yesterday.

"Don't know how long this rest and reorganization can be. Haven't been home for almost two years." The corporal picked up the military cap to dust it off, and covered it on his face, as if chatting with Tan Shuangxi or himself.

"At least a long leave is no problem," A voice came from above.

"I heard people from the battalion headquarters say, this time going back will give a three-month vacation!"

"Three months! Why don't you say discharge immediately upon return?"

"Really," The speaker was anxious, "I heard it from Little Liu. He is a messenger of the battalion headquarters. Any news from above, he knows fastest."

"If really can rest for three months, I'll divorce my wife upon return! Change for a new one." Someone spoke shocking words.

People around emitted a burst of roar of laughter.

"Forget it, still divorcing wife. Burning high incense if your wife doesn't divorce you!"

"Exactly! Gone for two years, can't guarantee there isn't a bit of green on the head..."

Tan Shuangxi didn't join this banter, but silently stared at the bunk board of the upper bunk in a daze. Unknown which big-headed soldier pasted a "Beauty Calendar" on the bunk board; the affectionate Xi Shi was looking at him.

"Brother," A head stuck out from the upper bunk, "Getting married this time home?"

"Married? Bullshit! It's blind date (matchmaking)." Tan Shuangxi laughed and scolded the upper bunk. The upper bunk was Tan Ende, a new recruit filled in only last year, a Shandong refugee who arrived in Lingao less than a year ago. Because of the same surname, he always added a "Brother" to the address of Tan Shuangxi.

With the recovery of Guangdong and Guangxi and the influx of endless immigrants, the gender ratio in Lingao began to gradually move towards balance. Hot items in matchmaking activities began to be no longer limited to high-ranking officers and naturalized citizens; ordinary sergeants also began to have opportunities to gain favor from females. Every time troops were comforted, among the consolation letters from female youths, there were quite a few with secret affection. This also made many old bachelors who had served in the army for many years eager to try.

Tan Shuangxi calculated secretly. This time he had been supplementally appointed as Platoon Leader. Just because he wasn't a Commissioned Officer, he could only count as "Acting Platoon Leader"—in the troops such sergeants were called "Housekeeping Sergeant."

Although "Housekeeping Sergeant" also fulfilled the duties of a Platoon Leader, he was "Acting" after all. Using a witty remark, it was "Maid holding keys, managing household but not making decisions." If a new officer was assigned to the company, he could be directly replaced.

The Company Commander had told him to upgrade his diploma as soon as possible. As long as he had a Class B Diploma, he could apply for Officer Candidate qualification.

Although Officer Candidate was just "Candidate," right now there were many officer vacancies in the troops. High probability he could be promoted to Warrant Officer rank without too long. It could be counted as stepping one foot into the officer ranks, wearing not a sergeant short sword but a command saber. The Platoon Leader appointment would also be solid.

So he planned to take advantage of this major rest and reorganization to sign up for a troop cram school to storm the fortress and take the Class B Diploma exam.

Officers going on blind dates and sergeants going on blind dates, the objects they could contact were naturally very different. After all, in the eyes of common folks, sergeants were just "soldiers" getting a few more dollars. How could they be mentioned in the same breath as "officials"?

While in reverie, a burst of roar of laughter originating around interrupted Tan Shuangxi's reverie. Didn't know what they were laughing at. He also followed with a few dry laughs.

Laughter gradually dispersed. Soldiers in the cabin were almost all awake. Unable to go up to the deck to wash, and not yet time for meals. Soldiers lay on bunks chatting, content nothing more than what they planned to do after going back.

He heard a weak voice speaking intermittently:

"...Ambushed at Shaoguan. Only he was left of a squad, and broke a leg. I went to see him; he just cried, saying didn't know what to do back. I didn't know what to say either, could only comfort him saying the Senate would always give him a mouthful of rice to eat. He said he came to be a soldier to bring glory to ancestors. Now going back like this, afraid he can't even find a wife..."

"Sigh, this is all fate!"

Tan Shuangxi sighed silently. Fate! This is fate! Bizarre and motley, yet elusive fate!

He tilted his head to ask the Sergeant (Staff Sergeant) in the neighboring bunk: "Old Ma, what do you plan to do back?"

"Me?" The Sergeant lowered his voice, "I plan to apply for discharge."

"What?" Tan Shuangxi was so shocked he almost fell off the bed. Sergeant Ma was like him, promoted only recently. He was a son of honest fishermen, a famous good old man in the company, a kind uncle in the eyes of soldiers, a dull sergeant in the eyes of officers. Unexpectedly he wanted to discharge at this time.

"Fought for two years, only earned this bit of future (prospect), how come thinking of discharge?" A soldier beside asked.

"My family are fishermen. The family lived quite well in recent years. My dad and several uncles sold all the old boats, took out loans, pooled money to buy a new boat to go deep sea fishing. Especially profitable. Just not enough manpower, and everyone has no culture (education), doing things not effective. So called me back early to do it together."

"Isn't that a pity..." Tan Shuangxi couldn't help feeling regretful.

Sergeant Ma turned over, changed posture, and continued: "Can't say pity. First came to be a soldier because the village assigned corvee, then fighting bandits and government troops. These were all good deeds protecting the peace of a place. I couldn't hide. Now Guangdong is all liberated, the world should be peaceful soon. Everywhere is like Lingao, can work and live life peacefully. I just thought, I'm not the material for a soldier. No matter how hard I work in the ranks, I'm just a sergeant. Give me a Company Commander to do I dare not either. I'd better go back to sail and fish. I just like fishing."

A soldier asked curiously: "You really don't want to be an officer?"

"Saying don't want to is impossible. I also want to hang a command saber, how majestic. Seeing that new recruit egg (rookie) walking badly, go up and give him a kick." The corporal's exaggerated tone attracted soldiers nearby, emitting a burst of laughter.

"But I'm not this material. Commanding a squad is already very difficult. Commanding a hundred or eighty brothers, wouldn't I be in a rush and muddle? Can't bear this responsibility."

"That's true too. I also feel not material for a soldier! If could discharge, would have gone to find a job early! Many factories over in Guangzhou are recruiting. If not for discharge forbidden, I would have stayed in Guangzhou for recruitment."

"Discharge, you guys dream beautifully!" Someone sneered, "Think transferring us back to Lingao means no fighting?"

"If fighting, stay in Guangdong. Why transport us back thousands of li?"

"Any inside news, quickly say!"

"Inside news I have none. But Great Ming lost Guangdong and Guangxi, can they just let it be?" The soldier speaking was the clerk of the company, "Wouldn't the Emperor try to find a makeup? I see there are plenty of wars to fight. Returning to Lingao is just replenishing the ranks. After all, we had too much attrition in these two years. Replenished new recruits so many times and still understrength."

"But the Company Commander said last time those who want to discharge can discharge."

"Only those served more than three years and with experience of two injuries can apply. Whether Old Ma can discharge is hard to say." The clerk was educated and belonged to "core" personnel in the company. words spoken naturally carried weight. The surroundings immediately cooled down.

"This rest and reorganization will definitely give a big vacation. Does everyone have any plans? All speak up." Tan Shuangxi said to people around, thinking secretly, can't let the field cool down at this moment.

"I just want to go home to help my dad open up wasteland. He has said for a long time..."

"My family arranged a wife for me, want me to go look (xiang kan). If suitable then marry over!"

"I want to go shopping at East Gate Market with Erya of the village..."

"Platoon Leader, what about you?" Finally someone asked.

Tan Shuangxi chuckled and answered: "Vacation definitely sleep first. Sleep until naturally awake. Then eat big rice and salted fish until vomit." This answer caused a bigger burst of laughter. With the food supply of the Fubo Army, no one would regard these two things as life goals. "Take my dad and mom to turn around at East Gate Market, eat a meal at the cooperative," Tan Shuangxi still gave his plan.
