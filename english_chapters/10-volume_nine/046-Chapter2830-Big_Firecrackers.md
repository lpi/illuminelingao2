# Chapter 2830 Big Firecrackers

"Too little!"

"Toluene, oh toluene, my Chairman." Qi Chuqin threw up his arms dramatically: "Before, we relied entirely on coal gasification for that pitiful amount. Now with Seria Well No. 2's light crude, we can get toluene by direct heating and fractional distillation. But we can't use such good crude oil. I've talked to Planning Commission several times. Wu De says there's oil but no ships to transport it."

How to ship Seria's oil back had become a difficult problem for Planning Commission. The Senate had no oil tankers. The oil transport method was still the ancient way: packed in wooden barrels then shipped back on cargo vessels. The old-timeline unit "barrel" for oil was actually a vestige of this wooden-barrel transport.

As one could imagine, this transport method's efficiency was pitifully low, with huge losses en route. On one side, oil in storage pools couldn't be shipped out; on the other, factories had no raw materials.

"If light crude sits in storage pools for more than a few months, the light fractions evaporate away, leaving just some asphalt for paving roads and coating roofs? It's like forcibly turning diamonds into glass. If that oil could arrive in time, tomorrow I'd take Fubo Army to blast the Forbidden City flat and bring Zhu Youjian to Lingao for exhibition." Speaking of this, he assumed an expression of bitter anguish, practically accusing Wu De of being a "Short-Hair traitor" sabotaging production.

Wang Luobin suddenly remembered something and asked: "Planning Commission has a proposal to build a refinery in Seria to process oil locally. What does the Chemical Department think?"

"We fully support it, of course." Qi Chuqin said. "But far water can't quench present thirst. Our Danzhou Chemical has been under construction for years and can only be called preliminary in scale—still short on clothing and food. Building a refinery tens of thousands of *li* away—even with equipment, worker and technician problems can't be solved." Seeing Wang Luobin's expression seemed to suggest more, he quickly added: "Relatively speaking, shipping crude oil is safer. Given our current technical conditions, maritime transport of chemical products is probably more dangerous."

Chairman Wang turned to a male naturalized-citizen youth who looked like a secretary: "Note this down: prioritize solving Seria light crude oil transport problem! If necessary, use controlled vessels."

So-called controlled vessels meant the modern ships that Senators treasured and kept moored for maintenance.

Qi Chuqin's agitation was because he'd received the latest composition report from the exploration team at Seria oil field: newly extracted oil's composition had changed significantly.

Though Seria's crude was famous for its aromatic content, according to the exploration team's analysis, most of the newly extracted crude was in the kerosene fraction range, while benzene—the light naphtha fraction—was very scarce. Calculating annual production of 50,000 tons of crude, benzene production might be under 500 tons yearly, toluene under 2,000 tons—limited improvement over coal chemistry output. On the bright side, the gasoline ratio wasn't low at all—good news for the Senate's engine industry.

Given this, the aromatic-rich light crude currently extracted from Well No. 2 was extremely precious. Though that well was currently in its high-output stable-production phase, oil well production had an element of the mystical—hard to say how long Well No. 2 could maintain high production.

Letting extracted oil go to waste would be heartbreaking. Especially since benzene and toluene were primary raw materials for explosives, disinfectants, and pesticides. Once supply gaps appeared, current equipment production schedules would inevitably be affected. This was why he desperately requested priority shipping of Seria Well No. 2's crude.

"Though controlled vessels have advantages in speed and transport volume, the transfer process still requires barreling and cleaning barrels—labor-intensive, with major losses in the process. Can oil tanker construction be put on the agenda?"

"Build oil tankers?" Wang Luobin hesitated. The Senate's shipbuilding industry had made clear progress, but to date, the largest ship was only a 3,000-ton iron-framed wooden-hulled mixed-propulsion vessel. Building oil tankers seemed a bit too big a step.

"Have Chemical Department submit a proposal to Planning Commission. I'll follow up." Wang Luobin said.

"So these are Senator Qi's 'firecrackers.'" Mai Ruibao mused. Recalling fireworks workshops he'd seen in Guangdong's countryside as a child, he could finally understand what those machines were doing when he entered Specialty Chemical's black powder division—belt-driven drums and ball mills separately grinding saltpeter, charcoal, and sulfur. Most eye-catching were the wheel grinders: two enormous black iron discs suspended in mid-air rotating, barrels of saltpeter-sulfur-charcoal powder dumped onto the material pan beneath the wheels. The rotating iron wheels rolled and pressed the slightly moistened powder, grinding, kneading, gradually compacting into a large powder cake—he estimated at least a hundred *jin*. How could such a huge lump of gunpowder be used? If made into a firework and lit, it could probably blow the whole courtyard sky-high. Mai Ruibao was wildly speculating when he saw workers lift it from the material pan to a series of wooden mallet machines. The mallets, driven by connecting rods, pounded up and down, crushing the large cake into small pieces, which workers then poured into several step-shaped machines. "Note: this is the granulation process." The granulator's bronze rollers made grinding sounds, further crushing, grinding, and sifting the powder cake fragments. Depending on the screen mesh size installed, finished products of different specifications were produced. Hearing Qi Kelong explain that finished black powder was divided by granule size into rifle powder, fuse delay powder, and mining blasting powder, plus a special prismatic shape pressed for artillery propellant, Mai Ruibao recalled photos he'd seen in the newsroom archives: never mind Guangdong countryside workshops—even the government-run workshops in Guangdong-Fujian used stone mills for grinding, wooden mortars for pounding, bamboo baskets for sifting. Compared to everything before his eyes, they were two entirely different worlds.

The black powder factory enforced strict fire prevention—even electric lights were installed in exterior corridors, illuminating the interior through glass windows. To photograph, Mai Ruibao had to constantly go in and out between workshops. It seemed the slightest carelessness sparking a flame would cause a disaster leveling the entire factory. He couldn't help recalling Senator Qi's bold declaration: "Capture Zhu Youjian alive, blast the Forbidden City flat!"

"To really flatten the Forbidden City, we wouldn't even look at black powder." Still Qi Kelong's high-pitched voice: "Its position as gun and cannon propellant will soon be completely replaced by smokeless powder."

Mai Ruibao had encountered the term "smokeless powder" in classrooms and in *Lingao Times*, but knew very little. So when he saw workers in the workshop soaking degreased soft cotton balls into ceramic reaction vessels filled with strong acid, he was shocked—this gunpowder was made from cotton? Miss Sun was even more flustered, murmuring to herself: "This... this much cotton, how many *jin* of yarn could be spun, how many feet of cloth woven..." But Chairman Wang expressed dissatisfaction as always: "A hundred kilograms daily of smokeless powder—where is that enough? I see the factory's main product is Ballistite double-base powder. That's good. But nearly a third is Schultze powder. That stuff burns too fast—only works for smoothbores. Is there any point producing it? Are we making it for Senators to go bird hunting?"

"Bofang Factory's Remington-copy pump-action shotgun uses Schultze propellant. Special Reconnaissance Teams and Lingao Garrison Battalion are both equipped." The responder was Ji Tuisi, who was supervising nitrocellulose production: "This type of flake smokeless powder wins on simple processing, and can also fill hand grenades, saving other high explosives."

"The cotton we currently use for nitrocellulose production is mostly waste cotton from Lingao Textile Factory, mainly cotton linters—the fuzz remaining on cottonseed after ginning. It won't compete with the textile industry for materials. But consuming chemical products is unavoidable. Especially the ethanol used for dewatering nitrocellulose—Planning Commission, citing grain shortage for raw materials, keeps trying to cut our allocation every other day. Those bastards—when Light Industry sells liquor, how come they don't say that? Only thinking about making money, where does that leave the Senate's great cause of advancing south and north!" Qi Chuqin angrily chopped his hand downward.

Wang Luobin continued smiling and nodding, noncommittal.

"To be honest, nitrocellulose and smokeless powder production are both labor-intensive and very dangerous. I won't let workers start work until they're properly trained. Safety production is paramount—it's not something that can be solved just by increasing raw material supply." Ji Tuisi added: "Never mind completely replacing black powder—just guaranteeing enough smokeless powder to roll out across the Army and Navy needs at least two more years. Right now, meeting smokeless powder needs for Special Reconnaissance Team training plus Senator personal weapon reloads is already our factory's limit."

"In 1638, Specialty Chemical's greatest achievement won't be replacing black powder in propellant—it's eliminating it from artillery shells—specifically, from high-explosive shell filler!" Leaving the cartridge assembly workshop, Mai Ruibao still felt dizzy. Sunlight pierced through gaps in the clouds, nearly blinding—casting a halo around Senator Qi as he spoke grandly: "The disgrace of Fubo Army artillery shells producing at most 20 fragments ends here. The era of high-explosive shells has arrived!"

This factory area beneath his feet was close to Specialty Chemical, reachable directly by the cargo train, yet bore a sign reading "Bofang Arsenal Second Division." Mai Ruibao recalled the cartridge workshop he'd just passed was divided into two sections: one still manufacturing paper cartridges for Army-standard Year One Minié rifles, Nanyang-style smoothbores, and Hall rifles; the other assembling metallic cartridges for 1637-model rifles, 1634-model pistols, and so on. Especially the latter—those gleamingly bright brass casings practically froze his eyeballs. Even having studied, Mai Ruibao half-suspected the bullet casings were gold-plated. Making gunpowder from cotton and bullets from gold—now that was Senator style! By comparison, the artillery shell workshop seemed less eye-catching. In every corner and between machines were wooden buckets with lids covered in small holes. Ruibao asked Qi Kelong what equipment these were—they looked unremarkable, even somewhat superfluous and in the way.
