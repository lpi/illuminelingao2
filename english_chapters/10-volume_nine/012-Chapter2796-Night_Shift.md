# Chapter 2796: Night Shift

It wasn't until the whole army reorganized for combat readiness before the conquest of Guangdong and Guangxi began that he truly encountered such things. Some soldiers suddenly jumped up in the middle of the night, put on uniforms, and screamed about wanting to "die on the battlefield." There were also people sitting on beds at night, half-asleep and half-awake, mumbling numbly: "I won't go... I won't go..."

After arriving on the battlefield, such things happened even more frequently. However, the legendary "mutual hacking and trampling" didn't happen, but there were always soldiers with various manic behaviors. Timely waking them up had a high probability of restoring normality. There were also those who collapsed like this, unable to hold a gun anymore. Finally had to be sent back to Hong Kong for treatment.

Troops returning to camp, reasonably speaking this moment counted as feeling "home" with feet on solid ground. People would truly relax. But emotions of fear, anger, and hatred accumulated over those hundreds of days and nights converging together, were very likely to erupt suddenly when people's spirits were most relaxed.

Regarding the problem of Camp Howl, when Tan Shuangxi was promoted to Corporal (Junior Sergeant), he listened to a course lectured by a Section Chief Deng of the Mental Health Institute in the Training Corps. Although he listened in a fog, only knowing what P-T-something-D, "hysteria," "collective unconsciousness" and the like, he also learned such a simple fact: trampling and hacking in Camp Howl largely were done intentionally by people taking advantage of the "Camp Howl." Repaying grievances with grievances, repaying hatred with hatred.

Although knowing how Camp Howl came about, officers and sergeants still felt scalability numbness hearing this term. In a big dormitory of thirty or forty people, someone howling at midnight, even if not triggering a riot, was creeping enough.

"Everyone sleeps, we are on duty. Really suffering enough." Sergeant Ma said in the duty room with freshly brewed strong tea.

"Nothing much. These few days on the ship woke and slept, slept and woke. I count as slept full. How about gathering a game tonight?" He made a gesture of groping Mahjong.

"Gather a game?" Sergeant Ma laughed he-he, "Leave order hasn't been issued yet! Playing cards during duty, you are preparing to squat in confinement room."

"This consciousness of yours, pity not continuing to be a soldier." Tan Shuangxi said grinning, "Can't play cards, then have to chat (Set up Dragon Gate Formation)." Saying, took out a pack of cigarettes from the satchel, "Come come, strong tea matches cigarette, duty ration!"

Sergeant Ma took out a carton of cigarettes from his own satchel: "Smoke mine!"

Tan Shuangxi was also an old smoker. Glancing at it, laughed: "You street lamp hanger! This isn't Army Supply Grand Production. It's White Saint Ship! This stuff officers can't bear to smoke usually; where did you get so many?"

"What do you mean get. Could it be I stole it. This carton counts as my gift to you. You keep to smoke slowly."

"You are so generous, must have a ghost." Tan Shuangxi didn't open the cigarettes, took out the Army Supply Grand Production from pocket himself and lit it, "Say it, what's the matter?"

"Grenadier Company's Ma Kui, you know him?"

"Know, know." Tan Shuangxi nodded, "A tall and strong young lad. Supplemented in only last year. Your relative?"

"A brother out of five degrees of mourning (distant). His family was originally from Wenchang. Supplemented in for more than a year; the lad also got a Second Class Courage Medal. Just right the battalion wants large-scale promotion this time. He is also a candidate for promotion to Sergeant (Staff Sergeant)."

"Isn't this quite good?"

"You also know, promoting to Sergeant this time, many people meet conditions. He has only one Second Courage; not hard enough."

Tan Shuangxi nodded. Originally Second Courage was rare. What could be obtained in peace time were mostly Second, Third Class Meritorious Service Medals. Courage Medal requires participation in direct military action to be qualified to obtain. Originally very few people obtained it. But after Mainland Strategy, Second Courage suddenly became universal. Now the whole company not counting those left team due to injury/sickness and posthumous conferment, about one-third of people had Second Courage. Just this one strip (criterion) was indeed not enough.

"Speaking of seniority, he is about there. But not senior enough." Sergeant Ma said, taking a deep drag of cigarette, then blew it out, "I found someone to calculate. He still lacks a medal."

What person he found to calculate didn't need asking to know. High probability was the Battalion Headquarters Clerk. He was clear about various rules, regulations, and award standards.

"...This time back for Grand Rest and Reorganization, there is another award assessment. It is a comprehensive evaluation of performance during the whole campaign period, issuing First, Second, Third Meritorious Service Medals. You also know, as long as having Second Courage, getting a Third Meritorious is no problem."

Tan Shuangxi understood his underlying meaning. If only a Third Class Meritorious Service Medal, Ma Kui still couldn't stand out. Must go up one story higher.

But Second Class Meritorious Service Medal had a quota for every battalion. Those with manifest meritorious deeds were easy to say. Long service time, participating in many campaigns, getting many "Close Combat Medals," or having gotten higher level "First to Ascend" "Flag Capture" medals... Naturally ranking in front. These were hard indicators; no one could compare. The rest depended on "Service Performance." This was the operation space.

He didn't know Ma Kui's specific situation, but Sergeant Ma's words showed he had deficiencies in hard indicators. This Second Meritorious was imperative to get.

Regarding award assessment, sergeants of each company had great right of speech. After all, officers didn't deal with soldiers every day; sergeants did. Soldiers' situation, sergeants were clearest.

Immediately laughed: "Thought what matter. This doesn't count as anything. But there are quite a few sergeants in the battalion. Besides I and he are not in the same company..."

Sergeant Ma had a well-thought-out plan (bamboo in chest), "Doesn't matter. You just say whether can do it!"

"No problem." Tan Shuangxi knew him speaking to this extent mostly meant having already bribed well.

"Refreshing!" Sergeant Ma raised thumb, and lowered voice again, "This kindness, Ma Kui won't forget."

"A small matter." Tan Shuangxi said, opening Sergeant Ma's cigarettes, took out a box to open, inhaled a mouthful, praised: "Good smoke! Much stronger than Army Supply Grand Production!"

"If you like, take another carton." Sergeant Ma beamed with joy. Took out another carton from satchel. Pushed to his hand, "Take care of Ma Kui more in the future."

"Where do I have this ability." Tan Shuangxi hurriedly was humble.

"Don't hide it," Sergeant Ma laughed slightly obsequiously, "Heard you are about to apply for officer candidate soon."

"Doesn't this still need application? Besides this Class B Diploma isn't easy to get." Tan Shuangxi said, "Also don't know if there will really be a Grand Rest and Reorganization. If can rest for three months, I'll sign up for a cram school. Strive to take it down."

"This I actually know." Sergeant Ma said somewhat mysteriously, "Grand Rest and Reorganization is definite. Whole body vacation for three months. Just hasn't been announced yet. Estimate it's a matter of these few days. Discharge matter is also settled. Relevant documents all came down."

"So saying, really stopping fighting?" Tan Shuangxi was somewhat disappointed. Not fighting, even if he became a Warrant Officer, it would take Monkey Year Horse Month (a long time) to promote.

"Grapevine news says the Court wants to negotiate peace," Sergeant Ma blew smoke rings slowly, "Don't know true or false. But people meeting discharge conditions are not many..."

Speaking to here he probably felt he revealed too much: "Who knows! One thing I know, that is troops are going to be reorganized."

"Reorganized?"

"Reorganization starts after rest and reorganization finished." Sergeant Ma said, "Fighting for two years, personnel changed quite a lot; establishment is also a bit chaotic. Above wants to reorganize troops anew—Discharge is also a part of reorganization."

"Since reorganization, means there are still battles to fight."

"Afraid of no battles to fight?" Sergeant Ma laughed suddenly, "Isn't Chongzhen still being Emperor. Sky has no two suns; country has no two lords. Can Senators tolerate?"

"That's true."

"Fighting earns a background (status), good thing. But, fighting kills people." Sergeant Ma stared at the hurricane lamp on the table, saying faintly, "Dying myself is just that, just afraid of dragging down brothers under hand. I just can't pass this ridge in my heart."

"Since ancient times swords and guns have no eyes. Going into battle each depends on Heaven's decree. Not something you old brother alone can influence." Tan Shuangxi comforted him.

"Not talking about these." Sergeant Ma shook head smiling, "Old brother going back for matchmaking this time, have an object?"

Sergeant Ma was one of the few among sergeants who had a wife. His wife was like him, also of Tanka origin. Married when teenage. So Sergeant Ma wasn't old, but already had three or four children at home. Originally came to be a soldier to earn a few more money to support family.

"If having why still matchmake." Tan Shuangxi smiled bitterly, "My family condition is average. If not promoted to Sergeant, matchmakers wouldn't be willing to come to door. Family sent word saying local girls are unwilling to marry soldiers. This time also village came forward; otherwise probably no one willing to come for matchmaking."

Unwilling to marry soldiers was nothing more than "fearing death in action" "fearing injury and disability." Being a soldier also meant husband and wife separation. If stationed near hometown it was okay, but now "overseas deployment" was more and more; separation time became longer and longer.

"...My dad said, can't blame girls unwilling to marry. Magpie Bridge meeting is also once a year! You guys went to mainland for almost two years. Which girl is willing to keep this living widowhood!" Tan Shuangxi sighed, "I really envy you who can discharge. Go back to manage family property properly. I don't seek getting rich. Marry a wife, born a few children, whole family earn warmth and fullness, living days harmoniously is enough."

"Don't speak this spineless words. Fishing and farming, that's trade done by people with no way. You are younger than me; military merits are also many. Have great future in troops." Sergeant Ma joked, "Maybe a Big Chief in the future!"

"Ai ai ai, you stop making fun of me. Chiefs are Senators. Which scallion am I? Satisfied if can be a Battalion Commander in the future." For Tan Shuangxi, Lin Fu was his biggest idol.

"If this matchmaking succeeds, don't forget to invite me to drink wedding wine." Sergeant Ma blinked eyes, "The fish for your banquet I cover all. Guarantee goods best, price lowest."

"Matter hasn't even the first stroke of character eight." Tan Shuangxi waved hand. He looked at the ceiling, saying faintly, "Coming back from battlefield alive and kicking, and having opportunity to be officer candidate, count as lucky enough. Dare not have too many presumptuous thoughts."
