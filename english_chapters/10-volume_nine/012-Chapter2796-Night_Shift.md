# Chapter 2796: Night Shift

It wasn't until the entire army reorganized for combat readiness before the conquest of Guangdong and Guangxi that he truly encountered such things. Some soldiers would suddenly leap up in the middle of the night, throw on their uniforms, and scream about wanting to "die on the battlefield." Others would sit on their bunks through the night, half-asleep and half-awake, mumbling numbly: "I won't go... I won't go..."

After arriving on the battlefield, such incidents occurred even more frequently. The legendary "mutual hacking and trampling" never materialized, but there were always soldiers exhibiting various manic behaviors. Waking them promptly had a good chance of restoring them to normality. Some, however, broke down entirely—unable to hold a rifle anymore. These had to be sent back to Hong Kong for treatment.

Troops returning to camp should, reasonably speaking, feel they had come "home" with their feet on solid ground. People would truly relax. But the emotions of fear, anger, and hatred accumulated over hundreds of days and nights, all converging together, were very likely to erupt suddenly when their spirits were most at ease.

Regarding the problem of Camp Howl, Tan Shuangxi had listened to a course lectured by a Section Chief Deng from the Mental Health Institute when he was promoted to Corporal at the Training Corps. Though he only half-understood—grasping little more than terms like P-T-something-D, "hysteria," and "collective unconsciousness"—he did learn one simple fact: the trampling and hacking during Camp Howl incidents were largely done intentionally by those taking advantage of the chaos. Repaying grievances with grievances. Repaying hatred with hatred.

Even knowing how Camp Howl came about, officers and sergeants still felt their scalps go numb at the term. In a dormitory of thirty or forty men, someone howling at midnight was creepy enough, even if it didn't trigger a riot.

"Everyone sleeps while we're on duty. We really drew the short straw," Sergeant Ma said in the duty room, freshly brewed strong tea in hand.

"It's nothing much. These past few days on the ship, I slept and woke, woke and slept. I've had my fill of rest." He made a gesture of shuffling mahjong tiles. "How about gathering a game tonight?"

"Gather a game?" Sergeant Ma laughed. "Leave orders haven't been issued yet! Playing cards during duty—you're preparing to squat in the confinement room."

"Such consciousness! A pity you didn't continue as a soldier," Tan Shuangxi said with a grin. "If we can't play cards, then we'll have to chat." He took out a pack of cigarettes from his satchel. "Come, come—strong tea with cigarettes, the duty ration!"

Sergeant Ma produced a carton of cigarettes from his own satchel. "Smoke mine!"

Tan Shuangxi was an old smoker himself. One glance and he laughed. "You street lamp hanger! These aren't Army Supply Grand Production. They're White Saint Ship! Even officers can't usually bear to smoke this stuff. Where did you get so many?"

"What do you mean 'get'? You think I stole them? This carton counts as my gift to you. Keep them and smoke slowly."

"You're being awfully generous. There must be something behind this." Tan Shuangxi didn't open the cigarettes. Instead, he took out his Army Supply Grand Production from his pocket and lit one. "Out with it. What's the matter?"

"Ma Kui from Grenadier Company—you know him?"

"I know him." Tan Shuangxi nodded. "A tall, strapping young lad. Only supplemented in last year. Your relative?"

"A distant cousin, outside the five degrees of mourning. His family was originally from Wenchang. He's been in for more than a year now, and the lad even earned a Second Class Courage Medal. The battalion wants a large-scale promotion this time, and he's a candidate for Staff Sergeant."

"Isn't that quite good?"

"You know how it is. Many people meet the conditions for promotion to Staff Sergeant this time. With just one Second Courage, it's not enough."

Tan Shuangxi nodded. Second Courage had once been rare. What could be obtained in peacetime were mostly Second or Third Class Meritorious Service Medals. The Courage Medal required participation in direct military action to qualify. Originally, very few people obtained it. But after the Mainland Strategy began, Second Courage suddenly became universal. Now, not counting those who had left due to injury or sickness and those who received posthumous conferment, about one-third of the company had Second Courage. That criterion alone was indeed insufficient.

"Speaking of seniority, he's about there. But not quite senior enough." Sergeant Ma took a deep drag of his cigarette and blew out the smoke. "I found someone to calculate. He still lacks a medal."

Who he had found to calculate didn't need asking. It was almost certainly the Battalion Headquarters Clerk, who knew every rule, regulation, and award standard inside out.

"This time back for Grand Rest and Reorganization, there's another award assessment. It's a comprehensive evaluation of performance during the whole campaign period, issuing First, Second, and Third Class Meritorious Service Medals. As you know, having Second Courage makes getting a Third Meritorious no problem."

Tan Shuangxi understood the underlying meaning. If Ma Kui only received a Third Class Meritorious Service Medal, he still wouldn't stand out. He needed to go one level higher.

But Second Class Meritorious Service Medals had a quota for every battalion. Those with manifest meritorious deeds were easy to assess—long service time, participation in many campaigns, many "Close Combat Medals," or higher-level "First to Ascend" or "Flag Capture" medals. Such men naturally ranked at the front. These were hard indicators that no one could dispute. The rest depended on "Service Performance." That was where there was room for maneuvering.

He didn't know Ma Kui's specific situation, but Sergeant Ma's words showed he had deficiencies in hard indicators. Getting that Second Meritorious was imperative.

Regarding award assessments, sergeants of each company had considerable influence. After all, officers didn't deal with soldiers every day—sergeants did. No one knew the soldiers' situations better.

Tan Shuangxi laughed. "I thought it was something serious. This doesn't count as anything. But there are quite a few sergeants in the battalion, and we're not even in the same company..."

Sergeant Ma had clearly thought this through. "That doesn't matter. Just tell me—can you do it?"

"No problem." Tan Shuangxi knew that if he was speaking this openly, he had probably already arranged everything else.

"Refreshing!" Sergeant Ma raised his thumb, then lowered his voice again. "This kindness—Ma Kui won't forget it."

"A small matter." Tan Shuangxi opened Sergeant Ma's cigarettes, took out a box, and lit one. He inhaled and praised: "Good smoke! Much better than Army Supply Grand Production!"

"If you like them, take another carton." Sergeant Ma beamed with joy. He produced another carton from his satchel and pushed it toward him. "Take care of Ma Kui in the future."

"Where do I have such ability?" Tan Shuangxi said humbly.

"Don't hide it." Sergeant Ma laughed, slightly obsequious. "I heard you're about to apply for officer candidacy soon."

"I haven't even applied yet. Besides, the Class B Diploma isn't easy to get." Tan Shuangxi said. "I don't even know if there'll really be a Grand Rest and Reorganization. If we can rest for three months, I'll sign up for a cram school. Try to pass it in one go."

"Actually, I know something about that." Sergeant Ma said with an air of mystery. "Grand Rest and Reorganization is definite. Full leave for three months. It just hasn't been announced yet. I estimate it's a matter of days. The discharge matter is also settled—the relevant documents have all come down."

"So we're really stopping the fighting?" Tan Shuangxi felt somewhat disappointed. Without fighting, even if he became a Warrant Officer, it would take ages to get promoted.

"Grapevine says the Court wants to negotiate peace," Sergeant Ma said, blowing smoke rings slowly. "Don't know if it's true or false. But the people meeting discharge conditions aren't many..."

He seemed to realize he'd revealed too much. "Who knows! One thing I do know is that the troops are going to be reorganized."

"Reorganized?"

"Reorganization starts after rest and reorganization is finished." Sergeant Ma said. "Two years of fighting—personnel have changed quite a lot, and the establishment is a bit chaotic. The higher-ups want to reorganize the troops anew. Discharge is also part of the reorganization."

"If there's reorganization, that means there are still battles to fight."

"Afraid there won't be battles?" Sergeant Ma suddenly laughed. "Chongzhen is still Emperor. The sky cannot have two suns; a country cannot have two lords. Can the Senators tolerate that?"

"That's true."

"Fighting earns you status—that's a good thing. But fighting kills people." Sergeant Ma stared at the hurricane lamp on the table, his voice fading. "Dying myself is one thing. I'm just afraid of dragging down the brothers under my command. I can't get past this ridge in my heart."

"Since ancient times, swords and spears have no eyes. Going into battle, each man depends on Heaven's decree. It's not something you alone can influence, old brother." Tan Shuangxi comforted him.

"Let's not talk about this." Sergeant Ma shook his head with a smile. "Old brother, going back for matchmaking this time—do you have a prospect in mind?"

Sergeant Ma was one of the few among the sergeants who had a wife. She was like him, also of Tanka origin. They had married as teenagers, so though Sergeant Ma wasn't old, he already had three or four children at home. He had originally enlisted to earn more money to support his family.

"If I had one, why would I need matchmaking?" Tan Shuangxi smiled bitterly. "My family's circumstances are average. If I hadn't been promoted to Sergeant, matchmakers wouldn't even come to our door. My family sent word that local girls are unwilling to marry soldiers. This time, the village had to come forward on my behalf; otherwise, no one would be willing to arrange anything."

Unwilling to marry soldiers meant nothing more than fear of death in action, fear of injury and disability. Being a soldier also meant separation between husband and wife. If stationed near home it was manageable, but now "overseas deployment" was becoming more and more common, and the separation stretched longer and longer.

"My father said we can't blame girls for being unwilling to marry." Tan Shuangxi sighed. "The Magpie Bridge meeting comes only once a year! You went to the mainland for almost two years. What girl is willing to keep that kind of living widowhood?" He sighed again. "I really envy you—getting to discharge and go back to manage your family affairs properly. I don't seek wealth. Just to marry a wife, have a few children, earn enough for the whole family to eat warmly and dress warmly, living harmonious days together—that would be enough."

"Don't speak such spiritless words. Fishing and farming—that's the trade for men with no better options. You're younger than me, and your military merits are many. You have a great future in the army." Sergeant Ma joked, "Maybe a Big Chief someday!"

"Ai, ai, ai, stop making fun of me. Chiefs are Senators. What kind of figure am I? I'd be satisfied if I could become a Battalion Commander someday." For Tan Shuangxi, Lin Fu was his greatest idol.

"If this matchmaking succeeds, don't forget to invite me for wedding wine." Sergeant Ma winked. "I'll provide all the fish for your banquet. Guaranteed best quality, lowest price."

"The matter hasn't even begun to take shape." Tan Shuangxi waved his hand dismissively. He looked up at the ceiling, his voice fading. "Coming back from the battlefield alive and kicking, with a chance at officer candidacy—I'm already lucky enough. I don't dare have too many presumptuous thoughts."
