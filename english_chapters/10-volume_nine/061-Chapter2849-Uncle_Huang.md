# Chapter 2849 Uncle Huang

The two worked and chatted. With laughing and talking, in just over an hour, they'd tidied up over a hundred meters of channel.

"You haven't forgotten your skills." Perhaps chatting with Tan Shuangxi had lifted his spirits—Caiwang's expression had relaxed too.

"At the end of the day, we're still farmers." Tan Shuangxi sat on the channel bank, looking at the just-repaired channel. Sun shining on his body felt warm but not unpleasant. He could feel sweat flowing on his skin. The fatigue and satisfaction from labor made him feel mentally refreshed.

"Shuangxi, do you remember when we used to herd cattle together as kids?" Caiwang asked.

Tan Shuangxi laughed. "Of course I remember. Back then we'd always sneak off to swim in the river. Old Chen would see us and stamp his feet cursing."

They both laughed. Those childhood memories seemed like just yesterday.

"Back then the ox was Old Chen's." Caiwang said wistfully. "I kept thinking, when would our family have our own big water buffalo? I'd happily herd it every day."

Tan Shuangxi nodded. "Yeah, back then our dreams were simple—just hoping to have our own ox."

Caiwang laughed: "Your dream wasn't having your own ox. Back then you said: when could you go to Qiongzhou Prefecture to look around? That would satisfy you."

Tan Shuangxi laughed a bit sheepishly. "So naive back then. Just thought Qiongzhou Prefecture was like heaven. Didn't even know about Guangzhou—just knew there was a provincial capital somewhere."

"Now you've even been to Guangzhou. In the future, maybe you'll go to the capital, to even farther places." Caiwang said earnestly. "You've achieved your dream."

Tan Shuangxi looked at him, heart somewhat heavy. He knew Caiwang didn't have grand ideals—just thirty *mu* of land, an ox, wife and kids. If land and cattle could be more, if he could build a presentable big house, even better. Under Senate rule, such wishes shouldn't have been too hard to achieve... How fate toyed with people!

Seeing it was near noon, Tan Shuangxi said goodbye to Caiwang and returned home. His parents hadn't come back from the fields. Shuangqing had returned though, loading lunch into a basket to take to the fields.

When Tan Shuangxi had left to join the army, Shuangqing had still been a teenager. Now he was a proper young man. Just compared to other village youth, he still seemed quite slight.

Tan Shuangxi looked at the dishes in the basket and shook his head: "No meat!"

Tan Shuangqing laughed: "Meat's expensive. It's not busy farm season right now—no need for extra nutrition. Just eat your fill of rice."

"At least boil some eggs. The human body needs protein..."

"Dad says save the eggs to sell. Can't bear to eat them."

"How much can an egg sell for? Don't tell me they're trying to squeeze your bride price out of the chicken's ass." Tan Shuangxi laughed. "Tell me—how much bride price does the girl's family want?"

Mentioning his life's major event made Tan Shuangqing awkward: "Sixty dollars. Family can't scrape it together at once. Haven't formally settled yet."

Hearing "sixty dollars," Tan Shuangxi felt a jolt—was this the market rate?

"Where's the girl from?"

"Salt Field Third Village." Tan Shuangqing said. "Elementary school education. Can read and do math. Can work the fields too."

Tan Shuangxi felt another jolt, nearly blurting: "She doesn't want to keep studying, does she?" Afraid of dampening his brother's spirits, he acted casual and asked: "What's her name? I have quite a few comrades from the salt fields—might even know her family."

Tan Shuangqing seemed surprised: "She's from the Hou family. Pet name is Baihua."

"Hou Baihua." Tan Shuangxi silently repeated this name several times, memorizing it. He planned to go to the salt field tomorrow, pretending to visit comrades while secretly inquiring.

He changed the subject:

"Nobody collects eggs here? Does Mom still take them specially to Maniao to sell?"

Because the Senate vigorously promoted village chicken-raising, almost every rural household raised a few chickens. Eggs became the most common cheap protein source on the market. But rural consumption was limited—most still had to be sold in towns.

"Don't need to go to Maniao." Tan Shuangqing said. "Old Chen's family is now an agent. Specially collects chicken and duck eggs in the village."

"Agent—for the Senate?"

"Not the Senate—some merchant from outside. Heard he bought some 'patent' from the Senate and opened an egg factory. Specially processes eggs. Once the factory processes them, they can last a long time. Can be shipped far away to sell. They're even planning to supply the military."

Such talk would have sounded like fantasy to Tan Shuangxi a dozen years ago. Now it didn't surprise him at all. After all, the impression that the Senate could do anything had long taken root in his mind.

"Old Chen really knows how to make money!"

"He's so clever, see!" Tan Shuangqing picked up the food basket and water jug and left. Tan Shuangxi had just turned back to eat lunch when suddenly someone called from outside: "Brother Shuangxi! Brother Shuangxi!"

He hurried out to look—it was Uncle Huang from the village. Uncle Huang wasn't old in years, but already looked quite aged. In the village, he counted among the poorest. In the past, his family had no land and long-term rented others' fields. Later when the Heavenly Land Society collectively cleared wasteland, they sold reclaimed land to his family at low prices with long-term low-interest loans—thirty *mu*. Only then did they have their own land.

Though they had land, Uncle Huang's family hadn't improved much. From "cold and starving" to "barely getting by." Misfortune seemed to constantly hover over his family. First the ox the Heavenly Land Society had loaned them died. Not two years later, the wife they'd nearly bankrupted themselves to get for their son also died of illness. Then last year, Aunt Huang passed too. Of over two hundred households in the village, even refugees who'd arrived with nothing—once settled for a year or two—were living better than his family.

Seeing him, Tan Shuangxi sighed inwardly. Before the mainland expedition, he'd come home on leave. Uncle Huang had come to borrow money for his daughter-in-law's medical treatment. Originally his father hadn't wanted to lend, but Tan Shuangxi felt as a military household, their family should set an example in the village. He persuaded his father to lend six dollars. But when he'd returned a few days ago, his father had mentioned that not a cent had been repaid these years—naturally, the family's situation hadn't improved much either.

Looking at him, his complexion seemed okay, but his eyes were evasive. Clearly he wasn't here to repay.

Not here to repay meant not here to catch up either. Being poor and in debt, villagers had almost no dealings with his family. Coming to visit, he was obviously here to borrow money again.

But Tan Shuangxi always remembered the military's teachings—"Military and civilians are one family." He couldn't bring himself to turn him away. He could only smile: "Uncle Huang! Had lunch yet? If not, come in and eat with us..." He made to invite him inside.

But Uncle Huang waved his hand, saying quietly: "No need. I'll just stand here and talk." He glanced around as if he had something unspeakable to say.

"What is it?"

"I want to ask about something." Uncle Huang said. "You're in the military, and you're an officer now. You definitely know more than others."

"I'm not any kind of officer." Tan Shuangxi quickly disclaimed. "Just ask—whatever I know, I'll certainly tell you."

"The village is recruiting for the autumn draft. My son signed up too..."

Tan Shuangxi was surprised: "Dalo? Isn't he an only son? Doesn't need to serve."

"Not soldiering means no way out staying home." Uncle Huang's face was bitter. "The recruiter said if he's willing, he can volunteer and get an extra ten dollars settling-in money."

"Why put yourself through this!" Tan Shuangxi became incoherent. He was about to say there's fighting now—new recruits will very likely be sent to the front to fill ranks. What if he's wounded or killed? But he thought saying this might be "undermining morale." He was preparing to apply for candidate officer—couldn't say the wrong thing now.

After thinking, he changed to a more tactful approach: "Well, your household only has you three—grandfather, father, and son. If Dalo goes to soldier, what about your land? What about your grandson?"

"Land—I'm not farming anymore." Uncle Huang lowered his head. "The way my family's going, we can't repay the Heavenly Land Society debt..."

He said no more, then asked: "I just want to ask you something..."

"Please, go ahead."

"This draft—Old Chen's youngest boy is also on the enlistment list. A few days ago he came to discuss with me. Says he's willing to switch with Dalo..."

"Switch?" Tan Shuangxi was puzzled. "Switch what?"

It turned out that for volunteers like his son, they could choose to serve in National Army units stationed in relatively stable areas. This batch of National Army was being assigned to Taiwan—relatively safe. But correspondingly, the settling-in money was only half of Fubo Army's. Even with volunteer bonus, it was only twenty-two dollars.

This Fubo Army batch of recruits, rumor had it, was being assigned to the Second Battalion in Sanya. This battalion had always served as reserve in Sanya.

Now Old Chen was approaching him—if they were willing to swap enlistment slots, he'd give him a hundred dollars.

"...I just want to ask—that battalion in Sanya, will they be sent to fight on the mainland?"

Tan Shuangxi's heart churned with mixed feelings. He thought of the scene at the Daya Village banquet, and what Zhang Laicai had said. His heart was blocked up.

"I don't know the Second Battalion's situation. Don't know if they'll fight on the mainland." He said rather reluctantly. "I can only say any unit might get sent to the front."

This answer clearly didn't satisfy Uncle Huang, but he didn't press further. He just lowered his head with a long sigh, apparently unable to decide.

Tan Shuangxi couldn't help advising: "If you really want to soldier, better go National Army."

Uncle Huang shook his head with resignation: "Going National Army, the settling-in money won't even clear the loan."

The Heavenly Land Society land loan came due next year. Seven years, principal plus interest—over ninety-three dollars. That money he naturally couldn't produce.

"If it's seized, it's seized. You and Dalo could work as farm laborers and still have food and clothes. Why take this risk? If nothing else, the Nanyang Company is recruiting migrants for the South Seas. Go there and they give you land, plus settling-in money..." Tan Shuangxi had abandoned "caution" and was urging earnestly.
