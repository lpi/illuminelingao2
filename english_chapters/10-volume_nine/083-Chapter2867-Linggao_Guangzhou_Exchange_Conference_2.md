# Chapter 2867: Lingao-Guangzhou Exchange Conference (2)

Fu Bu'er sat in the Four Seas Pavilion, facing more than a dozen gentry from Lingao and Guangzhou arrayed around a round table draped in an ornate gold-threaded tablecloth. He felt thoroughly out of place. Though he bore the title of "Progressive Gentry," he had nothing whatsoever to do with the gentry class—he was simply a prosperous local farmer. Under the Great Ming, these Guangzhou elites would not have deigned to spare him so much as a contemptuous glance.

He understood his own position clearly enough. As one of the "first aboard," the Chiefs naturally trusted him more than these latecomers. Yet facing this assembly of provincial sophisticates with their dignified bearing and cultivated discourse, he could not suppress a creeping sense of inadequacy. His words came haltingly.

The gentry in the private room were mostly engaged in industry and commerce. Not a single pure farmer like himself among them. After exchanging a few pleasantries, conversation withered. Moreover, the Guangzhou delegation had spent recent days on "study tours," and this was their first meeting with the Lingao contingent. Unable even to recall one another's names, the gathering turned cold. Some gentry half-closed their eyes, feigning rest. Others debated the merits of the plates and chopsticks with their neighbors. A few took to studying the structure of peanuts in the cold appetizer dishes with scholarly intensity. Only when the serving girls glided lightly across the threshold did the gazes of these men—whose every gesture followed propriety—fix upon the dishes the girls carried. Or upon other things near the dishes.

Today's cuisine was something special. Since the Great Song's arrival, its thunderous reputation had spread not only goods but also gastronomy. Lingao gentry were thoroughly familiar with Australian dishes, and even prominent figures in Guangzhou had long sampled Ziming Tower's "foreign fare"—Scrambled Eggs with Tomato, Stir-fried Cauliflower and Broccoli, and the like. Serving these again would win no favor. Therefore, for this banquet, Zheng Shangjie had decided to innovate by introducing "Kaifeng Cuisine." First, to offer the gentry some novelty. Second, to promote it grandly on this occasion, establishing Kaifeng Cuisine as the new standard of refinement and fashion.

Led by Mayor Qian, several Senators from the commercial, agricultural, and industrial sectors visited each private room to toast and convey the Senate's sincere hope of mutual support and shared development with all present. Then service staff in form-fitting dresses brought out large serving platters topped with domed metal covers. When the staff lifted the covers in unison, steam billowed and dispersed, revealing the curious items beneath. More than a dozen plates held various offerings, accompanied by several large bowls of soup. One central platter bore a heap of golden, glistening chunks. Upon closer inspection, they appeared to be fried, but their surfaces were studded with small, round flat pieces—quite unlike any ordinary fried food. Another plate held more than a dozen round cakes, flat on the bottom and domed on top, with a dark brown layer sandwiched in the middle. A piece of emerald-green lettuce poked out from the edges of the brown substance. In form, they somewhat resembled stuffed buns, yet what stuffed bun displayed its filling so brazenly? One gentleman at the table mentioned that in the northwest, there was a food called "Rou Jia Mo"—the meat sandwich. Though he had never seen one himself, descriptions he had heard matched what lay before them. It was probably a variety of meat sandwich, but what the Australians meant by serving them this northwestern fare, he could not fathom.

The gentlemen exchanged glances, none willing to raise their chopsticks first. Courtesies flew back and forth:

"Elder brother, please—you first."

"Ah, worthy brother, please—you first."

"Since ancient times, there has been an order by age and seniority. How dare I presume? Please, you first!"

"Not at all. Worthy brother, have you not heard the story of Boyi yielding to Shuqi? Please, use your chopsticks first."

"Oh no, no. In ancient times, there was Kong Rong yielding pears. Today, please, elder brother—take the first bite!"

A table of rotund gentlemen exchanging courtesies with considerable enthusiasm. The service staff standing by covered their mouths and giggled, causing several faces to flush and several pairs of eyes to widen.

Gao Ju, as the earliest Guangzhou gentry to follow the dragon, was also seated at the table. He had subtly become the head of Guangzhou's Kun-affiliated gentry. Watching this endless yielding spiral nowhere, he grew uneasy. If the Australians took offense and grew resentful, the consequences would be severe. At this thought, beads of sweat appeared on Gao Ju's forehead. The Australians might well be deliberately testing those present.

Gao Ju straightened in his seat and cleared his throat. The gentry at the table understood the stakes and fell silent at once, looking to him for guidance.

Gao Ju cupped his fists and spoke in a ringing voice: "Everyone, we gentry and merchants of Lingao and Guangzhou, devoted to the Great Song—though residing in two places, we share one heart and mind. Our hearts are pure as ice, our loyalty undivided. To be graced with a banquet from our superiors today is truly a blessing cultivated over many lifetimes!"

"What Master Gao says is absolutely right!" The gentry at the table understood perfectly. Secretly alarmed, they hurried to agree in unison.

Gao Ju continued: "Consider our Great Song—crossing from beyond thousands of miles of waves, a nation rich and abundant. Its cuisine represents the pinnacle of the world's achievements!" Here Gao Ju raised his joined arms high, praying toward the heavens: "Long live our Great Song Emperor for ten thousand generations! Long life to Chairman Wang and State Councillor Ma! May District Chief Wen enjoy fortune and longevity!" The gentry at the table hastened to follow suit, bowing and offering endless praises.

After the prayer, Gao Ju steadily raised his chopsticks. "Everyone, this foolish elder will rely on his modest reputation to take the first bite." With that, he picked up one of the golden pieces, placed it in his mouth, closed his eyes, and chewed slowly, saying nothing. Seeing Master Gao take the lead and not wishing to appear ungrateful—thereby inviting trouble—the other gentlemen each shakily picked up a piece. They bit off small, timid mouthfuls, swallowing as if drinking bitter medicine while pinching their noses. But after the food slid down their throats, a fresh fragrance welled up from within. This thing... was actually quite good! Having tasted its flavor, their courage grew, and their chopsticks gradually became more active.

Fu Bu'er was timid by nature. During the earlier exchange of courtesies, he had cowered to the side. Others, noting his neat clothes but vulgar appearance, had no desire to engage with him. Only after everyone had begun eating did he timidly pick up a piece from the edge of the platter and take a small bite. The moment the food touched his tongue, the rich fragrance of deep-frying combined with the crispy coating burst across his palate. Beneath that richness, a fresh sweetness lingered on the tip of his tongue, refusing to fade. Fu Bu'er had dined at fine restaurants in Lingao, but this texture was entirely new to him. After a few bites, his courage grew. Seeing others pick up the stuffed cakes to eat, he boldly reached out to take one. But the cake was large and difficult to grasp with chopsticks. In his eagerness, Fu Bu'er simply reached out and grabbed it with his hand. Lin Quan'an, seated beside him, shot him a sidelong glance and cursed silently: *Country bumpkin!*

Fu Bu'er could not hear Lin Quan'an's unspoken ridicule. With the stuffed cake in his mouth, he felt thoroughly satisfied. The meat patty, rich with fat, and the bun's base, brimming with the fragrance of grains, were enough to satisfy any medieval commoner's mind and stomach alike. As for the piece of lettuce on top—that was merely decorative.

Despite being the famous "farm owner" of Hainan, with multiple farms across northern Qiong and several tropical crop plantations in southern Qiong and the Wuzhi Mountain area—listed first on the agricultural sector's "Above-Scale Planting Enterprise" registry—Fu Bu'er still maintained the traditional farmer's virtues of thrift and diligence in his personal life. His everyday meals rarely included meat. Only during busy farming seasons did the fare improve. When it came to various "Australian pleasures," he had actually experienced less than these Guangzhou elites who had traveled from afar.

Fu Bu'er bit into the stuffed cake while his eyes fixed on someone at the table picking up yellow strips and dipping them in a deep red sauce. He hesitated—should he swallow the cake first, or set down the cake and grab his chopsticks to secure some?

A scholar at the table intoned with swaying head: "Just now, Chief Xiong mentioned this is Kaifeng Cuisine. This humble one hails from Kaifeng, yet I have never encountered such dishes. I imagine our Great Song ancestors, dwelling myriad miles distant, still harbored their ancestral temples in their hearts, thus bestowing this name—signifying that one must never forget one's ancestors and homeland. Such loyalty truly inspires profound admiration!" Others echoed: "Indeed! Indeed!"

While everyone offered praise, the door opened and service staff filed in to deliver drinks. There was fine Lanling Wine and Guoshi Wushuang. Even the rarely seen Languiren and Princess Datang were among the offerings—though rumors had long circulated in Guangzhou that Princess Datang was brewed with rhubarb and proved extremely laxative. Ordinary people dared not try it. It was said that red-haired foreigners overseas adored this wine tremendously, paying dozens of gold pieces for a bottle. Common folk speculated that foreigners, loving to eat raw meat like "beef pie," found it hard to digest—their stomachs must become blocked. Unable to defecate and bloated with agony, they relied on this potent wine for relief. Whenever this topic arose, everyone laughed and scorned.

Besides wine, several accompanying sweet drinks were brought in. Rumors among the common folk held that Australians called these "yin niao"—"drink urine"—causing all who heard to shake their heads and sigh at the Australians' utter crudeness for making such vulgar remarks without shame. However, a later expert in Australian studies pointed out this should be "yinliao"—"beverages"—meaning sweet drinks so delicious they proved addictive. There was pale yellow Kvass, dark red Kombucha, and various fruit juices with colorful ingredients suspended within. Especially eye-catching was a black liquid in a large crystal bottle—its color dark as ink, still as a deep pool. Truly novel.

Fu Bu'er watched the girl delivering drinks place this large bottle of black water before him. She announced the drink names to everyone, and he learned this black water was called "Cola."

Fu Bu'er had seen but never tasted this substance. It had only appeared recently and was expensive; he could not bring himself to spend the money. Never mind this novelty—even Kvass and the various sodas that had gradually become common locally, Fu Bu'er was usually reluctant to drink. Whenever he saw the children enjoying them, he would inevitably lecture them on frugality.

"Pop!" With a crisp sound, the girl deftly pried off the bottle cap, startling Fu Bu'er. Then a fine fizzing reached his ears, making his teeth ache. The girl poured half a glass of the black water into the transparent crystal glass before him and said softly, "Please enjoy, sir," before moving on to serve others.

Fu Bu'er savored the girl's soft voice while carefully studying the tiny bubbles rising through the dark surface in his glass. These fine bubbles climbed to the surface, creating the gentle rustling sound he had heard. The black water must have been chilled before serving, for the glass wall was beaded with condensation. Without even tasting it, he already felt refreshed and cooled.
