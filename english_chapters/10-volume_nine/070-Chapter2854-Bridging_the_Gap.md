# Chapter 2854: Bridging the Gap

As soon as the pot lids were lifted, steaming white vapor mixed with the aroma of oil, cured meats, seafood, vegetables, and scorched rice rose into the air. The three were immediately attracted by this intense fragrance.

"Try it. This is the shop's signature dish. It is said the ingredients all come from Fujian. Old Cantonese love to eat it!" Guo Xi'er's brows danced with joy.

The three began to taste this delicacy. The clay pot rice here was indeed a signature dish: the cured meat fragrance was rich, the soy sauce savory and sweet, and the rice was cooked to the perfect texture. The scorched rice at the bottom, in particular, was golden and crispy without any bitter taste.

After finishing the clay pot rice, the waiter served three bowls of sweet soup, perfect for clearing the palate after such full enjoyment.

Guo Xi'er hadn't had a chance to speak just now, so taking advantage of the leisurely moment while eating sweet soup, she asked about the photo studio. She was very interested in this matter, so she grabbed Chen Shixin and asked relentlessly.

Chen Shixin was also happy to talk about this. He said he originally worked in the Propaganda Department of the Guangzhou Municipal Government and didn't have to come to the photo studio for an internship; he had fought for this opportunity purely out of curiosity.

"...Although photography is black and white and cannot reflect colorful hues like painting, its black and white tones and the different grayscale transitions between them have an indescribable charm. Especially the changes of light and shadow during shooting... this instantaneous art looks simple, but compared to painting, it has another completely different flavor..."

Obviously, Guo Xi'er wasn't interested in Chen Shixin's eloquent discourse; what interested her was how the photo "printed" people onto paper. This question was easy to ask but difficult to explain completely. Guo Xi'er fell into "One Hundred Whys," and Chen Shixin soon reached the limit of his vocabulary.

"...I'm just parroting what I've heard. The Chief's knowledge is too profound, and I am dull-witted by nature, so I really can't fully understand it," Chen Shixin said modestly.

"You really are modest." He Xiaoyue smiled, her fondness for the young man before her growing. "You just said you were originally in Guangzhou?"

"Correct, I worked in the Guangzhou Municipal Government as a propaganda officer," Chen Shixin said. "Besides doing propaganda, I painted murals, wrote big slogans, and so on..."

"So those big slogans and murals were all done by you?"

"Not all of them; colleagues in the Propaganda Department did them together." Chen Shixin suddenly realized something. "Is Miss He also from Guangzhou?"

"Mm-hmm, but I worked in the Civil Affairs Department." He Xiaoyue immediately recounted her work in the shelter.

"Oh my, I heard them talk about it. Later, the Chief even organized a collective wedding. It was truly remarkable. I didn't expect Miss He to have personally participated in such a grand event!"

Speaking of participation, as a member of the propaganda sector, Chen Shixin had naturally participated actively, but a clever girl like He Xiaoyue could surely figure that out.

"Propaganda Department..." He Xiaoyue seemed to remember something and lowered her head to drink a few spoonfuls of sweet soup. A moment later, she finally couldn't help asking, "Since you have been working in the city, you must know a lot of people, right?"

"I know most of the people in the Municipal Government," Chen Shixin said.

"Then... do you know a detective in the City Police Bureau named Li Ziyu?"

Chen Shixin was stunned, then suddenly laughed: "Of course I know him. Speaking of which, we are good friends."

"Good friends?!"

"Yes, we were classmates in the community school. Back then, we hung out together reading Australian books. After I came to Lingao, I didn't know his specific situation for a long time. Later, I found out he took the police exam..."

He Xiaoyue was both surprised and delighted, pressing, "Really?!"

"Of course it's true." Chen Shixin smiled. "I didn't expect that punk to have such bright official prospects..."

"How is he now? Is he doing well?"

"Official prospects are bright, as I said. He earned merits in several consecutive cases. His current rank is several levels higher than mine."

"That puts my mind at ease." He Xiaoyue touched her chest, tears glistening in the corners of her eyes. "Amitabha."

Probably feeling she had lost her composure and fearing a misunderstanding, He Xiaoyue hurriedly explained: "This Officer Li... is my benefactor. He saved me back then." With that, she recounted the past events in detail. "Without him, I would have... I would have..."

At this point, she was on the verge of weeping.

"So that's how it is!" Chen Shixin nodded repeatedly. "There was such a past! It seems Ziyu's bright official prospects are also due to the merit he accumulated in his daily duties."

"I've always wanted to see him and kowtow to him..."

"Aye, aye, aye, that is quite unnecessary." Chen Shixin waved his hands frantically. "As a police officer of the Great Song, serving the Senate and the people is Ziyu's bounden duty. Actually, it wasn't him who saved you, but our Senate, which is wholeheartedly devoted to the people! If Heaven had not sent down the Senate, eternity would be like a long night!"

Chen Shixin was a cadre of the propaganda sector, able to compose essays orally. The two young women couldn't help but praise him secretly: "Truly a talent."

"What you said is wonderful!" He Xiaoyue said excitedly. "What a phrase: 'If Heaven had not sent down the Senate, eternity would be like a long night'!"

"Mm-hmm-hmm!" Guo Xi'er nodded repeatedly. Seeing Chen Shixin only smiling slightly, she couldn't help asking, "What about you?"

"Me?" Chen Shixin laughed dumbly, then pondered for a moment and said, "I am unlike many comrades. Without the Senate, I would probably be an oil painter craftsman like my father, toiling in poverty, but likely managing to scrape through a life. Although the Senate did not save my life, it was like opening a pair of new eyes for me to see a brand new world..."

"Yes, a world turned upside down!" Guo Xi'er said.

Chen Shixin nodded, but He Xiaoyue knew his meaning lay not there. Her gaze met his in the air, and they smiled at each other unknowingly.

Guo Xi'er, however, was full of interest in photography. As the group closest to the Senators, she had had her photo taken many times and was very curious about the principles inside. She pestered Chen Shixin with questions.

Chen Shixin actually didn't know much himself. Seeing her attitude of "breaking the casserole to ask to the end" (getting to the bottom of things), he had to say, "Since Miss Guo is so interested in photography, tomorrow is my internship day. If it's convenient for you, come to the photo studio to take a look."

"Good, good, good! I will definitely go!" Guo Xi'er was elated.

He Xiaoyue quickly pulled her, reminding her: "Not going to work tomorrow?!"

"Oh, oh, right, right." Guo Xi'er realized tomorrow was a workday. According to the Senate's schedule, there were two rest days per month. Their next rest day was still three days away.

"It's fine, it's fine; a few days later is okay too." Chen Shixin laughed. "I will be interning in Lingao for a phase. Once I completely master the technology, I'll return to Guangzhou—Guangzhou is going to open a photo studio too."

"So you will go to Guangzhou to manage the photo studio?"

"Hehe, that won't happen." Chen Shixin laughed. "The one in Guangzhou will definitely be privately run. It will be bid out to merchants. Rich moneybags will bid for it. Speaking of which, if any family has spare money and wins this bid, they will definitely make a fortune."

"Aren't you a Guangzhou local? Why don't you let your relatives bid for it?" Guo Xi'er asked carelessly.

Chen Shixin shook his head: "My family is small and humble; where would we have rich relatives? We can only look at this way to get rich. Besides, I have to avoid suspicion."

"That's true too."

Seeing Sister Guo about to speak again, Chen Shixin feared she would say something "shocking" again. He stopped talking about the photo studio and steered the conversation back to fashion design, complimenting their design ingenuity. Then, changing the subject, he talked about fabrics.

"Looking at *Lingao Spring*, whether it's Wanzi Pavilion or other clothing societies, they have clothes of all fabrics, but they rarely make fur apparel."

"No market." He Xiaoyue shook her head. "In Lingao, the coldest it gets is five or six degrees, and only for a few days a year. Making clothes with wool is enough to be exquisite. Wearing fur would be too hot."

"But across the strait, there is demand in Guangzhou. Guangzhou's winter is much colder than here!"

Both Guo and He had experience spending winter in Guangzhou and knew he was telling the truth. In the 17th century, winter temperatures in Guangzhou often dropped below freezing, and there was ice and snow every year. The need for cold protection was much stronger than in Hainan.

Compared to cotton-padded jackets and wool, fur had stronger heat retention and was moisture-proof and waterproof. Therefore, dignitaries in the Qing Dynasty...

"We have seen many Australian fur clothing designs in the reference materials, but they can't be sold locally. We want to make them, but we lack the ability."

"I heard in Guangzhou," Chen Shixin said leisurely, "that Wanzi Pavilion will expand to Guangzhou in the future and open a branch..."

"Right, right, right, I heard that too!" Guo Xi'er nodded.

He Xiaoyue hesitated and said, "There is such a rumor."

"Once in Guangzhou, won't there be a market for fur clothing?" Chen Shixin said. "Right now, you can plan ahead and start making them."

"Making them is possible," He Xiaoyue said. "Last time, the Director said we could design some fur clothes first and let the factory make patterns and samples. But now we don't even have raw materials..."

"Yes, I saw in the reference materials there are dozens of types of fur. Just mink fur has many differences based on body parts; it makes my eyes blur. I don't even know what they look like or what texture they feel like. The Director said the best mink fur is soft gold, very, very valuable..."

Chen Shixin smiled: "Speaking of which, Brother Ziyu has a distant relative. His family was originally from Jiangnan and had been processing fur for generations. The business couldn't go on, so they came to Guangdong. Now they are preparing to open a factory in Hainan. If you are interested, I can ask him to send some samples over another day."

"That would be great, of course, but we can't pay for the goods..."

"Since they are samples, naturally no payment is needed. You can try making them first. Just in case you want to make fur clothes in the future." Chen Shixin said, "I heard from Trini that wearing fur clothes is also very popular in Europe now. Dignitaries almost all have to buy them. And they update styles very quickly..."

Chen Shixin spoke extravagantly, and Guo Xi'er listened with gusto. He Xiaoyue, after all, had some experience and knew Chen Shixin's words were bridging a gap, setting the stage for future cooperation. However, she didn't dislike what he was doing. After all, this was also a new growth point. Moreover, this Huang He was said to be Li Ziyu's relative... She said immediately, "We can give it a try. How do we contact him?"

"This is his calling card." Chen Shixin took out a small plum-red card from his pocket, which read "Huang He, New Jiangnan Leather Company."
