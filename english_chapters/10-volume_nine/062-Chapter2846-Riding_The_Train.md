# Chapter 2846 Riding the Train

"And there's all the debts piled up over the years." Uncle Huang shook his head stubbornly. "Times have been bad—I've borrowed over twenty dollars from various families in the village. Your family alone, I owe six dollars. If I really become a farm laborer, I'll probably never be able to pay it back. Going to the South Seas is even worse—running away from debts is something I can't bring myself to do."

If he agreed to the swap, just the Fubo Army settling-in money would be twenty-four dollars, plus ten dollars voluntary enlistment bonus, plus the hundred from the Chen family. He could not only clear the land loan but also pay off village debts. Might even have a bit left over.

"...I've thought it through. At this point, there's no choice but to gamble." Uncle Huang said quietly. "I've figured it out. Once the debts are cleared, the land is mine. I can contract it out to village folks—there'd be a little income each year. I can still work myself. No problem supporting my grandson. If he comes back safely from service, we take back the land, and our family will have turned things around. If his luck is bad..." He paused here. "Between the death benefits and the land rent, I can still raise the grandson and leave him an inheritance..."

Tan Shuangxi couldn't think of what to say to dissuade him. He could only offer a few phrases like: "Better to think it over carefully," and "The debts can be paid back slowly." Weak and ineffectual words.

After seeing Uncle Huang off, Tan Shuangxi's mood took an inexplicable blow. The joy of reuniting with his childhood friend had vanished completely.

From Uncle Huang's words, more likely than not this deal would go through. Actually, he understood—if they didn't do it, their family's land would have to be returned to the Heavenly Land Society.

Farmers viewed land as their lives. Tan Shuangxi understood what was at stake here.

"Forget it. Better just study. Try to get the Class-A diploma." He thought to himself.

Tan Shuangxi wouldn't be called "brilliant." Years in the military had gotten him the Class-B diploma, but Class-A represented a major leap in depth of knowledge. Fangcaodi students took five years of study to get the higher elementary diploma. The Class-A diploma, as an equivalent qualification, wasn't as broad or deep as the school diploma, but for someone without proper schooling, it was still a major challenge.

Looking at the *Self-Study Series (Class-A)* he'd specially borrowed from the Maniao Fort library, Tan Shuangxi sighed deeply: This stuff was too hard!

What gave Tan Shuangxi the biggest headache was mathematics. Chinese, natural science, social studies—all fine, just require memorization. But math didn't work that way. He recognized every word in the math book, but put together, he couldn't understand the meaning. Come to think of it, the four arithmetic operations on the Class-B exam had already made Tan Shuangxi miserable.

"Better just sign up for a training class." After struggling with "self-study" for a while, Tan Shuangxi finally made up his mind: spend some money and get it done. Go directly to Fangcaodi and sign up for the equivalent qualification training class.

The Senate's main educational institutions—the Women's College of Arts and Sciences went without saying—the vocational schools, normal college, and the National School's elementary, higher elementary, middle school, and study departments all had separate campuses within the Fangcaodi Education Park with strict access control. They didn't accept over-age students, nor was it convenient to openly admit continuing education students. So the Education sector had early on built an independent building not far from Fangcaodi, establishing adult education classes for "equivalent qualifications." Sharing faculty with the National School, vocational schools, normal college, and women's college, it served backbone naturalized-citizen cadres and employees from Senate-affiliated enterprises and institutions seeking to improve their cultural literacy. Various aspiring local youths who wanted to enroll could also participate, as long as they could afford the tuition.

This tuition wasn't cheap. The Senate's knowledge was valuable. Moreover, once you obtained an equivalent qualification diploma, it meant you'd unlocked the pass to employment within the Senate's "system." Even if you didn't plan to work for the Australians, this diploma had plenty of gold content—you could easily become a "teacher" at some large trading house.

He checked the sun—just past noon. If he went to Bairen Town now, he could still make it back before dinner. Decision made, Tan Shuangxi took his military ID, gathered his things, and hurried out the door.

Outside-the-Field Village was within the Lingao city rail network's coverage. After walking just over twenty minutes, Tan Shuangxi reached Maniao Station and caught the train bound for Bairen Town.

The locomotive belching black smoke slowly pulled out of the platform, heading for Bairen Town. It wasn't rush hour, so there should have been few people in the carriage. Instead, it was fifty or sixty percent full. All young able-bodied men—some in uniform, some in civilian clothes—but one look at their posture and bearing showed they were all soldiers home on leave.

Tan Shuangxi chose a window seat, somewhat bored, watching the scenery flash by outside.

The soldiers in the carriage were in high spirits. From their freshly shaved blue-shadowed chins and newly trimmed short hair, they must have just returned from the mainland recently. Pockets stuffed with silver dollar certificates, ready to have a good "wild time" in Bairen.

This kind of indulgent pleasure Tan Shuangxi had already fully tasted. Now he only felt the weariness that came after indulgence. Years of military life had given him a constant tension, keeping his mind and body always strung tight. Relaxing after coming home actually made him somewhat uncomfortable.

He really needed to adjust his state quickly. He thought: passing the exam in one go within three months would be quite challenging.

After signing up for the training class, should he rent a room in Bairen Town to stay? His home wasn't far from Bairen, and the city rail connected them—transportation was very convenient. But studying at home, there would always be distractions. Villagers came to chat with him almost every day. Shuangqing's happy occasion was approaching, with more people coming and going—every day something or someone to divide his attention.

It seemed he'd have to spend a bit more money and go study elsewhere. But this rare leave would mean being separated from family again.

Nearby, several soldiers were discussing whether contracting land counted as buying land.

"...I paid real money. How doesn't that count as buying?"

"Buddy, if you bought it, where's the deed? Did the Land Office issue you a deed?"

"They did! Some kind of land business license..."

"You know what business rights mean?" one soldier laughed. "Means the land isn't yours, but you can farm it! Whatever grain or cotton you grow is yours..."

"But I'm also the one paying the grain taxes."

"They let you farm it—who else would pay the tax? Think about it: doesn't the contract have a term? Should be twenty-five years, right? What you call buying is actually just leasing twenty-five years of business rights!"

"So? This 'buying' is actually pawning?"

"Exactly, it's pawning. The deed they issued you can't be resold!"

"That's no fun. All this fuss and the land isn't even mine!"

"Whether the land is yours doesn't matter. What matters is whether the produce from the land is yours."

...

Tan Shuangxi half-listened to their chat. The city rail began slowing down. Tan Shuangxi knew Bairen Station was still three stops away and didn't pay attention.

Suddenly a graceful figure appeared before him and said softly: "Excuse me... General, is this seat taken?"

Locals rarely called soldiers "General." Tan Shuangxi was quite surprised. Looking up, he saw a woman.

Women riding the Lingao city rail wasn't unusual, but this one was quite different. The dress she wore was called something like "Han elements"—actually a hybrid of original Ming Dynasty clothing and Australian-style garments. This style preserved traditional clothing forms while fully demonstrating the advantages of "Australian-style clothing" in cutting and fit. It was very popular among local wealthy families, especially wealthy immigrant families.

Though he'd only glanced briefly, the woman's appearance had already left a deep impression. He couldn't help looking a second time. The woman before him was around thirty, strikingly beautiful. She didn't have the shoulder-length hair or braids common among female naturalized citizens, but rather a "reformed" hair bun. Combined with her outfit and the small leather handbag in her hand, she was clearly some wealthy family's lady.

But such a lady going out would usually have accompanying servants or maids. She had no one with her.

This made him immediately cautious. He unconsciously shifted his body and said: "No one. Sit wherever you like."

The woman thanked him and sat in the opposite seat. Tan Shuangxi couldn't help glancing at her a few times. He saw her brow furrowed, eyes downcast, as if worrying about something.

A mysterious beautiful woman was most alluring. But the rational voice in Tan Shuangxi's mind told him clearly: this woman had something off! So he just looked out the window, not giving her another glance, lest she try to start a conversation.

But the more you fear something, the more it comes. He heard the woman's voice again: "Gen... General! Does this train go to Bairen?"

Now he couldn't pretend not to notice. He had to turn and say: "Yes, it goes to Bairen."

"Um, I need to go to Wanzi Pavilion," the woman said with a touch of anxiety. "Which station should I get off at?"

Tan Shuangxi didn't know any Wanzi Pavilion. East Gate Market or Bairen Town had hundreds if not thousands of shops—how could he remember them all? He shook his head: "I don't know this place."

The woman seemed slightly disappointed. Bairen Town was now quite large, with a city rail transfer station and four different stops altogether. Getting off at the wrong station meant walking an extra *li* or two. For ordinary people that was fine, but for this woman who clearly had "liberated feet," that would be difficult.

Thinking of this, Tan Shuangxi kindly added: "If that's the case, just get off at Bairen Main Station. There's a rickshaw waiting area there. Getting a ride anywhere isn't expensive."

"How... how much would that cost?"

Tan Shuangxi thought: you're asking me this too! But having already spoken up, he couldn't not answer: "Within Bairen Town, at most just a few cents..."

"A few cents?" The woman's expression wavered. She looked at her handbag. He wondered to himself: this woman clearly came from a wealthy family—could she not even have a few cents in her bag?
