# Chapter 2868: Lingao-Guangzhou Exchange Conference (3)

Fu Bu'er picked up the glass and licked it with the tip of his tongue, inwardly exclaiming as his mouth stretched to his ears—*What is this stuff!* Sweet yet bitter and astringent! Like a medicinal brew that had sugar added and then gone sour. But looking around, all the experienced gentlemen were savoring this black water with apparent enjoyment. Not daring to put down the glass and show weakness, he could only hum and pretend to enjoy it. But after forcing himself to sip for a while, he gradually found that this black water was sweet within its bitterness, and after the sourness and astringency passed, an indescribable sweet fragrance spread back on his tongue. He just felt energized throughout his body; the fatigue from a whole day of rushing about was swept away, and even his mind seemed much more alert. He couldn't help marveling inwardly—these Australians really had their ways, able to make all sorts of strange things!

Fu Bu'er didn't know this was the "Coca-Cola" that Lingao Pharmaceutical Factory had painstakingly reverse-engineered—the beverage formulation itself wasn't anything special. Cola's ingredients weren't rare, and with their capabilities, it wasn't difficult to formulate. The real difficulty was how to add carbon dioxide to the beverage. In earlier years, Lingao's carbonated beverages, like Kvass and fruit sodas, relied on natural fermentation of grains or fruits. It wasn't until just before the Guangzhou landing that this knockoff cola was put into production, finally solving the process of injecting carbon dioxide into liquid and maintaining it.

However, because Director Shi had an innate distrust of coca and "the most basic conscience of an intellectual," she had been half-resisting the market release of this knockoff cola. In the end, it was Deng Boyuan (now wherever there was a revenue stream, there was Senator Deng's rotund figure) who patted his chest and guaranteed that the extract dosage used by the pharmaceutical factory was "negligible," and presented relevant data from America, before Director Shi finally uttered those two words: "Approved."

Thinking that once this thing came out, his own wastrel children would inevitably follow the trend and buy it, Fu Bu'er felt another wave of unhappiness at the thought of his children.

These past few years, with the support of the Tiandihui, Fu Bu'er's fortunes had been smooth sailing. His land grew more and more, to the point where he felt he "couldn't look after it all." The children at home naturally were all put to use. Yes, just as he used to drive the children to do farm work, now he drove them to "manage."

Although Fu Bu'er wasn't very educated, he had a talent for driving people to work. Among his children, the most promising was naturally Fu Fu, whom he had once treated as a "discarded piece." He had joined the army and become an officer over the years. In military uniform with an Australian sword at his waist, he was majestic walking down the street. But Fu Bu'er hadn't gotten any benefit from him. After years in the army, he hadn't earned a single penny for him. And as soon as he became an officer and came back, he opened his mouth to propose marriage, wanting to marry Fu Yijin.

Back then, Fu Bu'er had personally promised Fu Fu that once he became an officer, he would give his daughter to him in marriage. Now that he had become an officer, and Yijin was already over twenty and couldn't be delayed any longer, he formally engaged them. Fortunately, marrying into a Fubo Army officer family wasn't a loss. After all, this was an era when military men were valued. Having the status of a military family wasn't a bad thing.

But apart from this "military family" status, he hadn't gotten anything. The local bride price was certainly high, but before the engagement, several officers from the "Political Department" had come, gently reminding him to "respond to the New Life Movement" and "promote new wedding customs." The core issue was, of course, the bride price. Fu Bu'er's heart bled, but he could only "actively respond." As a result, he didn't receive a single penny in bride price, only getting eight categories of engagement gifts. Although there were some valuable pieces of jewelry among them, these would have to go back with the daughter as dowry anyway.

In the end, he got nothing. Fu Bu'er was deeply displeased. One money-losing proposition wasn't enough—there had to be two! Fu Fu had also grown up eating his rice!

Then there was Fu Xi. Back then, following the advice of Chief Wan, he had sent her to "learn accounting." The result was that after three or four years of study, she came back as another Fu Fu—after graduation, she directly took a position with the Tiandihui. She had become a "public servant." That manner, that bearing—not only he, but even his wife, who used to beat Fu Xi until she rolled on the floor begging for mercy, instantly felt three inches shorter seeing her.

Fortunately, Fu Xi didn't hold grudges and was quite attentive to him as a "model household." But she wasn't family anymore—he couldn't use her, and didn't dare to.

Luckily, ever since Fu Fu's glorious homecoming, he had kept his wits about him and made special efforts to win over the other adopted children. Not only did their living standards improve dramatically, but through several intense episodes of domestic violence, he prohibited domestic violence against the children. Moreover, he declared multiple times that "they're all children of his family, and none would be treated unfairly." Fu Yue, Fu Qing, and Fu Xiang, after reading for a bit, all came back to help with the family. Now they were all important cadres of "Bu'er Agricultural Limited Company." As for his two biological sons, the younger one, San Tong, was very clever and currently studying in middle school. The whole family could be said to be quite prosperous.

Only his most valued eldest son, Er Yin, gave him the biggest headache. Er Yin had also been sent to study, originally hoping he would learn agriculture or finance to help the family business in the future. But unexpectedly, this Er Yin wanted to study medicine.

Studying Australian medicine was indeed an excellent livelihood these days. Even if one didn't want to work in a large hospital, opening a small clinic meant money rolling in. But now Fu Bu'er's family enterprise was large, and he looked down on this small change. Er Yin, as his eldest son and future heir, could study agriculture, could study business—why did he go and study medicine!

Father and son had quarreled about this several times. Fu Bu'er couldn't win against his son, and Senator Fu had come to put in a word, saying his son was "promising material." He couldn't refuse a Senator's face, so he had to bear it and prepare to "work on it gradually."

The banquet was reaching its climax. On one side, pretty girls brought out dishes like flowing water. On the other side, gentry clinked cups freely. Fu Bu'er had things on his mind and inevitably drank a few more cups. Strong liquor paired with Cola—he just felt the alcohol rushing to his head, and his capacity seemed to have decreased compared to before. Dizzy and blurry-eyed, he leaned back in his chair watching the gentry at the table, who after a few cups had already shed their reserved manner and were toasting and chatting freely, with great camaraderie. Although he had no one to talk to, he inexplicably felt happy inside and just kept grinning.

In the midst of the merriment, Fu Bu'er felt a blur before his eyes as a beautiful woman in a green dress seemed to float in through the door like a cloud—with red lips and white teeth, just like a fairy from an opera.

Only to see this fairy "float" in through the door, openly curtsey, and speak in a clear voice: "Blessings to all the gentlemen. This humble servant Qingruo wishes all the gentlemen well."

Gao Ju had recently gained increasing favor from the Australian superiors. Not only had he become Chairman of the Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce, but he had also recently taken on the role of Advisor to the Guangzhou Municipal Government. On this trip to Lingao, Chairman Wang had personally received him, praising his "firm stance" and "active pursuit of progress" during the currency reform. Moreover, a project he had bid on recently had smoothly commenced; it was about to go into production. Everything was going well, and he was feeling quite expansive. Just now at the table, his fellow countrymen had been very complimentary, frequently toasting him, so he had drunk a few cups more than usual. Now, seeing such a girl enter, whose manner was that of someone in charge, he steadied himself and said with dignity: "That's enough formality. What is your business, miss?"

Only to see that Qingruo remained in her curtsey without rising, speaking in refined language: "How can the gentlemen's golden evening banquet be without music for entertainment? Our establishment has a clear-singing troupe with quite fine voices. Shall I have them come in to sing a fashionable tune to add to the elegance?"

Since Ziming Tower's reconstruction, the clear-singing troupe, under Senator Pei's cultivation, had seen their skills skyrocket. Newly arranged ditties like "Story of a Small Town" and "Sweet Honey" had become wildly popular in Guangzhou, driving the city's young lotharios mad with obsession. Today, having them specially perform for the gentry of both regions was also an important part of fully demonstrating the Great Song's soft power.

Gao Ju was about to agree with a chuckle when suddenly someone at the table shot to his feet and said with a smarmy smile: "What do we need those little hussies for? Miss, you're so... so ravishing, you must be an old hand at this. Why not just stay and drink and sing with us?" Before the words had finished, an oily hand reached straight for Qingruo's shoulder.

Gao Ju frowned. He recognized this as the eldest son of Boss Mi, Mi Yijing. The Mi family were old "night soil lords," having monopolized the city's night soil routes for generations—you could say they made a fortune daily. They also had the power to make anyone's home "stink to high heaven" at any time. Even the city's top gentry had to give the Mi family some face.

Since the Australians entered Guangzhou, under the pressure of circumstances, the Mi family had proactively surrendered their night soil routes, donated large sums for military expenses, and purchased many shares of South Sea Company stock—basically exchanging all this for a safe landing. Now they had invested in several new enterprises, which were operating quite well, barely maintaining their status.

For this trip to Lingao for study, Boss Mi couldn't get away. Feeling that his son was already in his thirties and should see the world and build connections with Senators, he sent this young master as a representative to Lingao.

This Mi Yijing wasn't exactly a good-for-nothing who only knew how to eat, drink, and play. He could hold his own in business. But this young master was also the ringleader at pleasure quarters and the leader among the ladies of the night. After a few cups of liquor muddled his wits, seeing Qingruo enter, half-drunk and half-looking for trouble, he reached out to grab her.

Gao Ju was about to intervene when, before he could speak, he saw Qingruo's smile unchanged. She simply stepped back slightly. Mi Yijing, being drunk and unsteady, missed his grab and lurched forward about to fall. Qingruo, her hands withdrawn into her long sleeves, grabbed his arms through the fabric and said sweetly: "Thank you, sir." With that, she stood up straight, as if Mi Yijing had kindly helped her rise.

Mi Yijing steadied himself with that grab. He stood frozen for a moment before coming to his senses, feeling both annoyed and angry, only to find cold sweat breaking out all over his body. His face was flushed red from the strong liquor in his stomach. He decided to go all out and brazenly stepped forward, snatching up two wine cups from the table and thrusting them into Qingruo's hands: "Let's not rush, miss—there's a saying at the drinking table: 'Wine in the cup, not drinking makes you a pup.' Let's drink a wedding toast today, shall we?" Several drunk gentry at the table, seeing there was entertainment to be had, slanted their gazes to watch the show.
