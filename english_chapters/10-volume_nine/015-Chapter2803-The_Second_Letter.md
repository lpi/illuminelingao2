# Chapter 2803 The Second Letter

"Come press on this, quick!" Tan Shuangxi ordered the soldier to apply pressure while he freed his own hands. There was no time to undo Guo Dapeng's clothes or turn him over, so Tan Shuangxi could only shove his clothes upward with both hands to feel for the wound's location. Tan Shuangxi started feeling up from the waist. He expected the rear exit wound might also be on the right back, but before his hands even reached up, the middle finger of his left hand sank into the body. The wet, slick sensation startled Tan Shuangxi, and he quickly pulled his hand out, shouting, "The wound is here!"

Another hole was on the back right waist. The wound was much larger; the lead shot had exited sideways, tearing a one-inch gash. The shot had hit a rib inside the body and changed direction. The soldier beside him handed over another first-aid packet. Tan Shuangxi unfolded it and bound it on him. Before he could finish tying it, the medic arrived, felt Guo Dapeng's neck, and said, "Don't bother. He's already dead!" Both his tone and voice sounded resigned.

Tan Shuangxi looked up at Guo Dapeng's face. He had long since stopped breathing, his lips slightly parted, his eyes wide open but unfocused... From the moment that terrifying cannon shot rang out in the bushes to the cessation of his "Oh! Oh! Oh!" breathing, it had only been a few dozen seconds.

He had expected to be extremely angry, filled with murderous intent. Yet he wasn't. The pitch-black night, the cold mountain wind, the sound of guns and cannons in his ears, the roars of slaughter, the wailing of the dying... For a moment, his heart was filled with a sense of powerlessness. Fear gripped his heart, depriving him of the strength to stand up for a time.

"...To tell the truth, I was really scared at that moment! Terrified! My legs wouldn't stop trembling, my heart kept sinking, that feeling was like a hand tearing at my heart!" Tan Shuangxi's hand holding the wine glass was also trembling. "Don't laugh at me. I count as a veteran, having seen combat dozens of times and experienced big scenes, but I had never been so scared that I couldn't move like that day..."

"And then?" Zhang Laicai pressed.

"It took a while before I felt 'alive' again. At that moment, I only felt filled with rage, wishing I could immediately poke the ambushing bandits full of holes! But there were no enemies in front of us at all, only abandoned corpses and two firelocks. They must have lit the fuse and ran. The forest was dense and the grass tall; walk a few steps in and you wouldn't know north from south." Tan Shuangxi wiped his eyes. "Old Zhang, you know? When we fought so fiercely in the Chengmai Battle, moving corpses, transporting the wounded, and repairing fortifications on the earthen embankment, I wasn't scared at all. But this time, every time we marched near the edge of a forest, my heart panicked terribly, feeling like a cannon shot would ring out the next moment."

"Did you send out point men?" Infantry drill manuals require point men in front and on the flanks of the main body during marches. When encountering complex terrain like forests, they must search as they advance. This is a basic combat requirement.

"Do you know why Guo Dapeng didn't even get a 'Three Excellents' in the end? Because he was the point man, and he thought it was hard to walk in the dark forest..." Tan Shuangxi let out a rough breath here, threw his head back, and took another big gulp. "Can't blame him either. From enlistment to sacrifice, he only served half a year."

"New recruits die fast; those who survive become veterans." Zhang Laicai drank until his eyes were red. "Look at our platoon; more than half are new faces."

"Once the wounded and sick return, we'll be over strength."

"Isn't that why they say we're reorganizing?" Zhang Laicai said. "Probably expanding again. I heard we're going to fight a big war with the Imperial Court! Fight straight to the capital and sit on the Dragon Throne!"

"Sitting on the Dragon Court is a matter of time. Do emperors take turns sitting too? There are several hundred Senators."

"Probably similar to how it is now."

"How many years can a person live? I wonder how many Senators will be unhappy in their hearts." having drunk wine, Tan Shuangxi grew bolder and spoke out the doubts hidden in his heart.

"What are you saying that for?!" Zhang Laicai sobered up instantly, looking around timidly. "Where do you think we are!"

Tan Shuangxi also felt he had misspoken and quickly continued drinking. The two tacitly didn't mention the matter again. They started talking about tomorrow's business.

"Tomorrow we're delivering to Hu Weide's family." Tan Shuangxi sighed as he spoke. "He and his wife were very loving, and newly married too. I'm afraid she'll cry her eyes out tomorrow."

"I heard he was a live-in son-in-law?"

"Yes, he was a Fulao, a 'Shooting Plough' person. His father-in-law is a local. A small wealthy landlord even."

"Since he's a live-in son-in-law, surely he has no brothers at home. How could he come out to be a soldier?"

"Originally he didn't need to be a soldier," Tan Shuangxi sighed. "There's a policy. Naturalized citizens with a Class B diploma can be promoted to candidate officer after serving voluntarily for one year, so he came to be a volunteer soldier. If he hadn't fallen, he would be at least a second lieutenant when he came back this time. Sigh!"

"What a pity!" Zhang Laicai also sighed.

"He was muddled too. With that Class B diploma, he could have done anything—passed the civil service exam, the military academy exam, entered a factory—he qualified for all of them. Yet he ran off to be a volunteer soldier! Lost his little life in a muddle. Probably didn't even leave a cub behind."

Despite their sighing now, neither Tan Shuangxi nor Zhang Laicai liked Hu Weide much. Zhang Laicai didn't like him simply because he was a Fulao; most locals didn't like outsiders. Tan Shuangxi didn't like him because Hu Weide loved to brag about his wife everywhere. The intensity of his bragging was such that the whole company knew: a pauper actually married into a small landlord's family in Botang Village as a live-in son-in-law. It showed how annoying this guy was. Even more annoying was that he often showed off ambiguous romantic affairs until he was beaten up severely by a few soldiers who had been single since birth, which finally quieted him down.

But orders were orders, and out of respect for the dead, Tan Shuangxi and Zhang Laicai still had to fulfill their responsibility to Hu Weide.

Early the next morning, they set off from Fushan. Along the way, they first went to several other places to deliver death notifications. It wasn't until close to noon that they headed towards Botang. But this Botang Village wasn't near a railway station, and there were no public carriages in the countryside. The two had to rely on the iron feet trained in the army, asking for directions as they walked along the country roads. It was already afternoon when they arrived.

The two had walked the whole way. There were no markets on the road, so they could only rely on grass rations to satisfy their hunger. Reaching Botang, they were tired and hungry. Asking at the village office, they learned that Botang was a large village with sixteen *paijia* under it. Hu Weide's home was in the Eleventh Jia, still almost five *li* away from the village office.

"I'll get someone to guide you. It's not easy being on official duty," the village head said, then asked, "From your looks, I guess you haven't eaten yet?"

"Really haven't." Tan Shuangxi couldn't care about politeness anymore. "Where is there a food stall here? We'll eat a meal before going."

"Where would a countryside place get a restaurant? Besides, you're here on official duty; how can we ask you to spend money?" The village head called over a half-grown boy, "Go tell your mother that comrades have come to the village on duty. Make food for two and bring it here!" Then he greeted them: "Comrades, sit and rest a while. The food will be ready soon!" He brought a large teapot and poured herbal tea for the two.

Normally, they would have to decline based on discipline. Now, burning with hunger, they couldn't care less. They sat down and waited for the food.

While waiting, Zhang Laicai inquired about Hu Weide's family situation. After all, they knew very little about this comrade-in-arms. Except for the wife he properly bragged about, he had never mentioned anything specific about his family situation.

"His family," the village head said, "His father-in-law is named Fang. The Fang family is a major clan in this village. His father-in-law was originally a landlord, owning dozens of *mu* of land, farming himself and hiring a few long-term laborers. He's prospered greatly these past few years and is a model household for the Heaven and Earth Society."

"So the family is very rich..."

"Rich implies naturally, but he's very stingy." The village head laughed. "Hu Weide was originally a long-term laborer in his family. He looked upright and could read and calculate. In no time, he charmed the Fang girl so much she wouldn't marry anyone else. Originally, Father Fang looked down on him, firstly because Fulao have no roots, and secondly because this Little Hu usually acted quite flippantly, fearing he was unreliable. But the daughter insisted on marrying. Although he let him marry in, he never had a kind word for him."

"Any children?"

"None." The village head sighed. "He went to be a soldier only three months after getting married. Father Fang scolded him thoroughly, saying he was seeking his own death... Now, sigh, sigh, sigh! Poor Fang girl, widowed at such a young age."

Tan Shuangxi understood in his heart. Nine out of ten times, the father-in-law had nothing good to say, so Hu Weide signed up for the army in a fit of pique, wanting to earn a future and hold his head high.

Unexpectedly, he lost his life just like that.

No need to guess much; the Fang girl would recruit a new husband within a year or two at most. And Hu Weide would ultimately lie in obscurity in the Chaozhou military cemetery, forgotten by people.

Thinking of this, Tan Shuangxi felt a blockage in his heart. He couldn't help but let out a rough sigh. Suddenly thinking of something, he asked, "Does Little Hu have other relatives?"

"He was a Fulao who came to Hainan as a 'Shooting Plough' settler. Where would he have any relatives locally?" The village head shook his head. "I heard him say: his family used to get by, but later met with misfortune. They really couldn't go on, so the whole family sold everything, and the siblings each took some travel money to find their own way. That's how he came to Hainan. It's been over ten years, adding up before and after; the family is probably long gone."

"Since he's from Fujian, exactly where is he from?" Tan Shuangxi wouldn't give up and asked again.

"Not sure. Who cares?" The village head smiled. "Ask the Fang girl when you see her. She probably knows."

As they were talking, the half-grown boy came carrying a large bamboo basket, hailing them: "Officers, please eat!"

"Eat, eat." The village head opened the bamboo basket and took out two large bowls of fragrant rice noodles—white rice noodles topped with shrimp meat and vegetables, looking very appetizing.
