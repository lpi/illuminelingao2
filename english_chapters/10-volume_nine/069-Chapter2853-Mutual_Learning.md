# Chapter 2853: Mutual Learning

He Xiaoyue and her friend had originally planned to visit Apricot Blossom Tower, but since they had invited Chen Shixin on impulse, that venue no longer seemed appropriate. The establishment was too grand; for a first meeting, its opulence might make him apprehensive and give rise to misunderstandings about their intentions. After a moment's consideration, she decided to find something more moderate.

Such a place stood not far away, bearing the signboard "South Country." Its owner had come from Guangdong to establish the restaurant. The business opened each morning with tea and dim sum, positioning itself as "mid-range" to specifically target "middle-class families." The architectural decor was exquisite yet tasteful, the menu extensive, and the prices reasonable. Morning tea service ran through the forenoon, while a dedicated banquet hall accommodated larger feasts. This combination attracted a steady stream of local middle-class patrons: high-ranking naturalized cadres, factory technicians, farm owners, and small to medium merchants. Business flourished.

The shop proudly advertised "Authentic Canton Prefecture Flavor," serving "Cantonese Cuisine" and "Cantonese Dim Sum." In truth, both differed considerably from their seventeenth-century counterparts in the old timeline. Many celebrated dishes and dim sum of Cantonese cuisine had been "pioneered" by Senators in this timeline. Moreover, in the past, restaurants and tea houses belonged to separate trades, and by guild rules, restaurant proprietors could not simultaneously operate tea houses. South Country's "two-in-one" business model was unprecedented in the seventeenth century; even in the twentieth, this format only gradually took shape during the 1930s. So in essence, the establishment still carried a distinct "Kun flavor." Rumor held that both the owner and the cook had received guidance from a Senator named Li.

South Country Restaurant's frontage was considerably more modest than high-end establishments like Apricot Blossom Tower, and its location somewhat more secluded. However, its facade was elegantly appointed, emphasizing an antique aesthetic—though this "antique flavor" was actually that of the old timeline. For a Guangzhou Senator, the style would evoke nostalgic dreams of the City of Rams. But to the common people of the seventeenth century, this was unmistakably "Australian flavor."

South Country Restaurant rose three stories high. As night descended, its lights scattered like stars across the building. Two red lanterns hung prominently on either side of the entrance, their glow illuminating a wooden signboard bearing four large characters—"South Country Restaurant"—painted in gold lacquer. The signature beneath read "Hong Huangnan." Marble steps led to the door, polished to a spotless shine.

Evening service had just begun, and the restaurant's interior was gradually coming alive. Two hostesses stood at the entrance wearing figure-hugging cheongsams with side slits and high collars, greeting guests with smiles and authentic "Guangzhou Mandarin." Their voices were gentle and sweet.

Chen Shixin was a Guangzhou native, and He Xiaoyue also hailed from Guangzhou Prefecture. Hearing the familiar dialect of their hometown, warmth stirred in their hearts. Even before stepping inside, they already felt favorably disposed toward the place.

Entering the lobby, they were greeted by a stone feng shui pool with a rockery bonsai serving as a decorative screen. A school of colorful goldfish glided through the water. Along the walls, more than a dozen pots of orchids were tastefully arranged.

Numerous octagonal palace lanterns hung throughout the hall. Round tables stood in neat rows, each draped with a red tablecloth embroidered with golden dragon and phoenix patterns—festive yet dignified.

At this hour, evening guests were settling into their seats one after another. Families gathered together, pairs and trios of close friends chatted, and traveling merchants entertained clients. Some conversed in hushed tones while others laughed heartily. The air was rich with the aromas of cooking and oil, suffused with an atmosphere of ease and contentment.

Since they needed to "discuss business," the three went upstairs. The second floor consisted of semi-open private booths separated by screens, offering a measure of privacy without the minimum spending requirements of formal private rooms. They chose an elegant booth by the window and took their seats. Looking outside, they saw ten thousand lights glittering and crowds flowing through the street. The night scene was mesmerizing, and they remained entranced until a waiter came to take their order, breaking the spell.

"I don't know how many times I've seen it, but every time, I can't help but stare..." He Xiaoyue remarked wistfully.

Chen Shixin smiled. "When I first came to Lingao, the streets were far less magnificent than they are now, let alone having such brilliant illumination. But back then, having just arrived from Guangzhou, when had I ever seen an entire street lit up? Standing on the street of East Gate Market, I truly felt as if I had arrived in heaven."

"You two certainly know how to talk," Guo Xi'er said with a frown. "Order, order!"

"You know best about food and drink—we leave it in your hands!"

"I rarely come here either!" Guo Xi'er protested immediately. Even as she spoke, however, she lowered her head and began flipping through the menu.

Within moments, she had ordered several dishes. The signature offerings here were Roast Goose and Clay Pot Rice. The ingredients were exquisite, considered top-notch among Lingao's mid-range restaurants, so she ordered both. Spotting a new item—Rose Lily Water Chestnut Drink—which she had never tried before, she added that as well. He Xiaoyue requested Lotus Seed Red Bean Soup. As for Chen Shixin, he chose Coconut Milk Sago.

He observed the two young women seated before him. He Xiaoyue wore a pink cross-collar waist-cinched cotton jacket above and white gauze Song pants below. The ensemble was neither as boldly unrestrained as the usual "Song style" nor as loose and figure-concealing as Ming attire; she appeared graceful and ethereal, revealing a hint of femininity within a young girl's purity. Guo Xi'er, meanwhile, wore a sky-blue dress whose hem fell to her ankles, revealing a section of jade-white instep, its collar exposing a glimpse of collarbone...

As a painter, he had seen many beautiful women. The models in Trini's studio were mostly Senators' Life Secretaries, among whom S-class beauties were not uncommon. In terms of physical appearance alone, He and Guo were far from their equals, but in spirit and vitality, they far surpassed them. Could Section Chief Fang have been right when he said, "Women are most beautiful when they're working"?

The three chatted as they ate, ranging from fashion design styles to painting techniques, then to the principles of photography, growing more engrossed with each topic. Even Guo Xi'er, who usually struggled to string together a coherent sentence, listened with fascination—this man before her knew so much! Especially regarding matters of beauty, he could draw upon examples effortlessly and explain them with logic and clarity. For instance, though they understood the basic principles of color matching when designing clothes, in practice they mostly applied color schemes directly from "Clothing Reference Materials." Chen Shixin, however, could explain color coordination systematically and offered many insights on specific applications they had never encountered—some even completely contrary to what their training class textbooks taught.

"Did the Italian teach you all this?"

"Some came from Mr. Trini, some from the Chiefs." Seeing their growing captivation, Chen Shixin felt secretly pleased.

"Comrade Chen, you know so much—you must come from a family of painters, right?"

"Not at all. My father was an oil painter craftsman, specializing in painting eaves, pillars, and furniture. I suppose that counts as a slight connection."

Chen Shixin continued: "...Although I loved painting, being a craftsman painter would only barely keep one fed and warm. So my parents supported my schooling, hoping a schoolbag would turn my fate around. But I simply wasn't cut out for it. I failed at studying in the community school and only loved reading 'Kun books'..." At this point, he caught himself and laughed. "Slap my mouth, slap my mouth. Speaking of the past, I let the old slang slip out again..."

"Never mind, never mind—it doesn't matter. What happened then?" Guo Xi'er gnawed on a chicken foot and asked eagerly.

"At that time, many Australian magazines and comic books circulated through Guangzhou's markets, available for rent at bookstalls. My childhood friends and I went to read them every day, growing more and more fascinated. Later, when construction of the Great World began along the Pearl River, many machines and ships arrived. To me, they were all novelties, so I often went to the riverside to sketch. One day, I was fortunate enough to meet a Chief..."

He recounted how he had met the Chief, how the Chief had guided his painting, and how he was eventually sent to Lingao to study.

"...Actually, regarding painting, both my father and I considered it something that couldn't be put on the table. For literati and refined gentlemen, it's an embellishment after obtaining an official degree. But to rely on it for a living places one in a lower class. When I came to Lingao, I still harbored the idea of learning a trade well so I could eat in the future."

At this, Chen Shixin grew somewhat emotional. "Thinking back, I underestimated myself. Only after arriving in Lingao did I learn there was such a thing as 'Art' in this world! From that moment on, I truly began to study painting seriously."

He spoke with mounting enthusiasm: "Take fashion design, for example. What connection could there possibly be between tailoring and painting? But later, seeing the reference materials the Chief gave me, I realized that to make good clothes, one must first possess a sense of beauty and keen eyes capable of discovering the beauty in life..."

He Xiaoyue nodded to herself: *This meal today was absolutely worth it.*

"That's wonderful! I want to properly learn the tricks of the trade as well," He Xiaoyue said. "I wonder if Mr. Trini is still accepting apprentices?"

Chen Shixin laughed heartily. "He's in high demand right now—it's difficult even to sign up for his apprentice class!"

"Then... how about I take you as my master?" He Xiaoyue boldly proposed once again.

"Me?" Chen Shixin was taken aback, then smiled immediately. "You trust me that much, Miss?"

"Of course. My eye for people is very sharp." He Xiaoyue was quite confident, having completely forgotten the past incident where she had been deceived by a man and sold.

"There's no need for a formal apprenticeship. If you truly want to learn, I'll teach you for free." Chen Shixin's gaze swept across their faces. "To have the opportunity to exchange ideas and learn alongside two rising stars of fashion design—I couldn't ask for more!"

Had this been said in the Great Ming, it would have implied flirtation. For them, however, it carried only the meaning of a compliment. He Xiaoyue smiled radiantly. Guo Xi'er, however, said, "If you teach for free, we'd feel embarrassed."

"It doesn't matter at all. We'll be learning from each other. But I must say this upfront: my time is limited, so we'll need to arrange the schedule carefully. What does your schedule look like?"

"We're basically free after work. We can spare an hour or two each day."

"That works well. I'll arrange the time." Chen Shixin took out a notebook and jotted down the details. He and He Xiaoyue also exchanged correspondence addresses. For all naturalized cadres, their correspondence address was not a residential location or work unit but a numbered mailbox. This ensured that wherever they went, mail would reach them accurately.

Just as they were talking, a loud call from a waiter announced the arrival of three clay pots, freshly removed from the charcoal fire and trailing wisps of white steam, carried over with iron tongs—the restaurant's signature Clay Pot Rice had arrived.
