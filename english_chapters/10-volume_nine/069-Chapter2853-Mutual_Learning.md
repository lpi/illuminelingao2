# Chapter 2853: Mutual Learning

He Xiaoyue and her friend had originally planned to go to Apricot Blossom Tower, but since they had invited Chen Shixin on the spur of the moment, going there wouldn't be quite appropriate. The place was too grand; for a first meeting, it might make people feel apprehensive and lead to misunderstandings about themselves. After thinking for a moment, she decided to find a mid-range shop.

There was such a shop not far away, with the signboard "South Country." The owner had come from Guangdong to open the shop. Its business model started with selling tea and dim sum in the morning. Its positioning was "mid-range," specifically targeting "middle-class families." The architectural decoration was exquisite and upscale, the variety of dishes was extensive, and the prices were moderate. It also sold morning tea in the forenoon. It had a dedicated banquet hall for feasts, thus attracting a large number of local middle-class people: high-ranking naturalized cadres, factory technicians, farm owners, and small and medium merchants. Business was quite booming.

This shop flaunted "Authentic Canton Prefecture Flavor," serving "Cantonese Cuisine" and "Cantonese Dim Sum." In reality, both were very different in the 17th century compared to the old timeline. Many famous dishes and dim sum of Cantonese cuisine were "pioneered" by Senators in this timeline. Moreover, in the past, restaurants and tea houses belonged to two different trades. By rule, the restaurant industry could not simultaneously operate as a tea house. South Country's "two-in-one" business model was unique in the 17th century; even in the 20th century, it only gradually took shape in the 1930s. So essentially, this shop still had a "Kun flavor." It was said that both the owner and the cook had received guidance from a Senator named Li.

The frontage of South Country Restaurant was much smaller than high-end restaurants like Apricot Blossom Tower, and its location was slightly more remote. However, its facade decoration was quite exquisite, emphasizing an antique flavor—of course, this antique flavor was actually the "antique flavor" of the old timeline. For a Guangzhou Senator, this style would evoke his old dreams of the City of Rams. But for the common people of the 17th century, this was "Australian flavor."

South Country Restaurant was three stories high. At this moment, as night fell, the lights of the restaurant were like scattered stars. Two red lanterns hung high on either side of the entrance, illuminating the wooden signboard with the four large characters "South Country Restaurant" written in gold lacquer. The signature was none other than "Hong Huangnan." In front of the door were marble steps, wiped clean.

It was now the start of evening business hours, and the inside of the restaurant was gradually becoming lively. Two hostesses stood at the door, wearing cheongsams with side slits and high collars tailored to their figures, smiling and welcoming guests in authentic "Guangzhou Mandarin." Their voices were gentle and sweet.

Chen Shixin was a Guangzhou native, and He Xiaoyue was also from Guangzhou Prefecture. Hearing the familiar dialect of their hometown, their hearts felt very warm. Even before entering the shop, they felt a few degrees of goodwill.

Entering the lobby, they were met with a stone "Feng Shui pool" and a rockery bonsai acting as a screen. A school of colorful goldfish swam in the pool. Along the walls, more than a dozen pots of orchids were displayed.

Many octagonal palace lanterns hung in the hall. Round tables were arranged neatly, each covered with a red tablecloth embroidered with golden dragon and phoenix patterns, appearing both festive and solemn.

At this moment, evening guests were taking their seats one after another. There were families, groups of two or three close friends, and traveling merchants banqueting clients. They either conversed in low voices or laughed heartily. The air was filled with the smell of cooking smoke and oil, full of relaxation and joy.

Since they needed to "talk business," the three of them went upstairs. The second floor consisted of semi-open private booths separated by screens, offering some privacy without the minimum spending requirements of formal private rooms. They chose an elegant booth by the window and sat down. Looking out the window, they saw ten thousand lights outside and heads moving in the street. Watching this night scene, they couldn't help but be entranced. It wasn't until the waiter came to take their order that they snapped back to reality.

"I don't know how many times I've seen it, but every time I do, I can't help but look..." He Xiaoyue lamented.

Chen Shixin smiled: "When I came to Lingao, the streets were far less luxurious than now, let alone having such brilliant lights. But back then, having just arrived from Guangzhou, when had I ever seen a whole street lit up! Standing on the street of East Gate Market, I really felt like I had arrived in heaven."

"You two really know how to talk," Guo Xi'er frowned. "Order, order!"

"You know best about eating and drinking; we entrust it to you!"

"I rarely come here either!" Guo Xi'er immediately explained. As she spoke, however, she lowered her head and began to flip through the menu.

In a few moments, she ordered several dishes. The signature dishes here were Roast Goose and Clay Pot Rice. The ingredients were exquisite, considered top-notch among Lingao's mid-range restaurants, so she ordered both. Seeing a new item, Rose Lily Water Chestnut Drink, which she had never tried before, she ordered a portion. He Xiaoyue asked for Lotus Seed Red Bean Soup. As for Chen Shixin, he ordered Coconut Milk Sago.

He looked at the two young women sitting in front of him. He Xiaoyue wore a pink cross-collar waist-cinched cotton jacket on top and white gauze Song pants below. It was neither as bold and unrestrained as the usual "Song style" nor as loose and figure-hiding as Ming attire; she appeared graceful and ethereal, revealing a hint of femininity within a young girl's purity. Guo Xi'er, on the other hand, wore a sky-blue dress, the hem falling to her ankles, revealing a section of jade-white instep, and her collar exposing a section of collarbone...

As a painter, he had seen many beautiful girls. The models in Trini's studio were mostly Senators' Life Secretaries, among whom there was no lack of S-class beauties. In terms of looks alone, He and Guo were far inferior, but in terms of spirit and vitality, they far surpassed them. could it really be as Section Chief Fang said: "Women are most beautiful when working"?

The three chatted while eating. They went from fashion design style to painting creation, then to the principles of photography, getting more and more engrossed. Even Guo Xi'er, who usually couldn't string together a coherent sentence, listened with fascination—this man in front of her knew so much! Especially regarding "beautiful" things, he could pick them up at his fingertips and speak logically and clearly. For example, although they knew the basic principles of color matching when designing clothes, in practice, they mostly applied the color schemes from "Clothing Reference Materials" directly. Chen Shixin, however, could explain color matching issues logically and offered many insights on specific applications they had never heard of, some even completely contrary to their textbooks in the training class.

"Did the Italian say all this?"

"Some were said by Mr. Trini, some were taught by the Chiefs." Seeing them getting increasingly captivated, Chen Shixin felt secretly pleased.

"Comrade Chen, you know so much; you must be from a family of painters, right?"

"Not at all, not at all. My father was an oil painter craftsman, specializing in painting eaves, pillars, and furniture. I guess that counts as a bit of a connection."

Chen Shixin continued: "...Although I liked painting, being a craftsman painter would only barely keep me fed and warm. So my parents supported my schooling, hoping a schoolbag would turn my fate around. But I just wasn't cut out for it. I failed at studying in the community school and only loved reading 'Kun books'..." At this point, he quickly laughed, "Slap my mouth, slap my mouth. Speaking of the past, I exposed the old slang again..."

"Aye, aye, aye, it doesn't matter. What happened then?" Guo Xi'er gnawed on a chicken foot and asked anxiously.

"At that time, there were many Australian magazines and comic books in Guangzhou markets available for rent at bookstalls. My childhood friends and I went to read them every day, getting more and more fascinated. Later, the Great World began construction by the Pearl River, and many machines and ships arrived. To me, they were all novelties, so I often went to the riverside to sketch. One day, I fortunately met a Chief..."

He recounted roughly how he met the Chief, how the Chief guided his painting, and later sent him to Lingao to study.

"...Actually, regarding painting, both my father and I felt it was something that couldn't be put on the table. For literati and refined guests, it's an embellishment after gaining an official degree. But relying on this to eat puts one in a lower class. When I came to Lingao, I also held the idea of learning a trade well so I could eat in the future."

Speaking of this, Chen Shixin felt somewhat emotional: "Thinking back, I underestimated myself. Only after arriving in Lingao did I know there is such a thing as 'Art' in this world! From then on, I really started to learn painting seriously."

He spoke with increasing enthusiasm: "Take fashion design for example. What connection is there between being a tailor and painting? Later, seeing the reference materials the Chief gave me, I realized that to make good clothes, one must first have a sense of beauty and keen eyes good at discovering the beauty of life..."

He Xiaoyue nodded secretly: *This meal today is so worth it.*

"That's wonderful! I also want to learn the tricks of the trade properly," He Xiaoyue said. "I wonder if Mr. Trini is still accepting apprentices?"

Chen Shixin laughed loudly: "He is red-hot right now; it's hard even to sign up for his apprentice class!"

"Then, how about I take you as my master?" He Xiaoyue boldly proposed once again.

"Me?" Chen Shixin was stunned, then smiled immediately. "You trust me that much, Miss?"

"Of course, my eye for people is very sharp." He Xiaoyue was quite confident, completely forgetting the past incident where she was deceived by a man and sold.

"There is no need for a formal apprenticeship. If you really want to learn, I'll just teach you for free." Chen Shixin's gaze swept across their faces. "To have the opportunity to exchange and learn with two rising stars of fashion design—I couldn't ask for more!"

If this were said in the Great Ming, it would imply flirtation. For them, however, it contained a meaning of compliment. He Xiaoyue smiled beautifully. Guo Xi'er, however, said: "If you teach for free, we'd feel embarrassed."

"It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. We are learning from each other. But I have to say this upfront: my time is limited, so the schedule needs to be arranged carefully. What about your schedule?"

"We are basically free after work. We can spare an hour or two every day."

"That's good. I'll arrange the time." Chen Shixin took out a notebook and jotted it down. He and He Xiaoyue also exchanged correspondence addresses. For all naturalized cadres, their correspondence address was not a residential address or work unit, but a number mailbox. This ensured that wherever they went, they could be accurately notified by mail.

Just as they were talking, with a loud shout from the waiter, three clay pots, just taken off the charcoal fire and steaming with white puffs, were brought up with iron tongs—the signature Clay Pot Rice of the shop was served.
