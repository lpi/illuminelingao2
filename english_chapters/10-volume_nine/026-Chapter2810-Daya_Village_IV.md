# Chapter 2810 Daya Village (IV)

"The person can't come back," Elder Sister Li said while crying. "Having a little of his ashes to bring back would be better than having nothing left..."

"Lieutenant Li's ashes are now buried in the Fallen Soldiers' Cemetery in Nanning," Tan Shuangxi said with his head bowed. He dreaded this question most these past few days. "If you want to have him moved back, that's also possible. But Guangxi isn't fully pacified yet, and the roads aren't very safe. Wait a while before you arrange this."

"In autumn, I'll definitely bring him back and bury him beside Father and Mother," Elder Sister Li said.

Elder Sister Li began going through Li Anze's effects, which was just that small notebook, reading page by page very carefully. The brother-in-law tried to lean in, but Elder Sister Li pushed him away. "I can read. I'll look myself. I know Anze's handwriting."

The sea breeze blew through the trees, leaves rustling. Swallows flew past the eaves returning to their nest, and the fledglings began their clamor. Paper pages turned one by one, the sound of tears falling on paper like rolling thunder in the heart.

The damp and cold sea breeze at dusk swept a cloud across the horizon, blocking the setting sun. Sunlight dyed the clouds golden, draping the seaside village in a hazy yellow. The brother-in-law still kept Tan Shuangxi company. A pile of cigarette butts lay on the ground; the book he had been reading earlier had fallen there, and he remained oblivious. He asked unrelated questions in fits and starts, eyes betraying bewilderment. Tan Shuangxi knew the composure earlier was merely the last of his reason; this present absent-mindedness was the normal reaction. By now, Tan Shuangxi had gained considerable experience with such things. Several villagers who had come upon hearing the news sat nearby, eagerly asking about battlefield stories from the newspapers. Some of it Tan Shuangxi knew something about, but many figures and battles he had never even heard of.

Seeing that dusk was falling and the mission was complete, just as Tan Shuangxi rose to take his leave from the brother-in-law, Elder Sister Li emerged from the room, supported by another woman. She had obviously been crying for a long time. The radiance from when they first met had vanished without a trace. She didn't bother about the tear stains on her face; she was weak as if she'd been seriously ill.

"Safe travels, comrades." Elder Sister Li said weakly, then signaled the woman supporting her to hand over a rush basket. "Nothing fancy. It was some food I'd prepared for Anze. You are all his comrades-in-arms; please don't disdain it..."

Zhang Laicai was about to decline, but Tan Shuangxi said: "Thank you, Elder Sister Li! We love the food you've prepared. We'll come visit you again..."

Not long after walking out, the village head arrived and invited them to eat.

"It's already dark. You won't make the coach in time. Stay at the village office tonight." Then he added another sentence: "Everyone heard you came and wants to see you."

The village head led them through the village's twists and turns, arriving at a compound. A crowd of people was already gathered at the hedge gate, a dense mass of forty or fifty villagers, all high in spirits. Though night hadn't fallen, lanterns were already lit in the courtyard, and two gas lamps were hoisted high on bamboo poles, radiating brilliant white light.

This setup was clearly not a "dispatched meal." The courtyard had a dozen or so tables of various sizes laid out. Looking at the dishes and drinks on the tables, it counted as a "banquet" already.

"Isn't this a bit much?" Zhang Laicai muttered.

Tan Shuangxi quickly said: "Village Head, your hospitality is over standard."

"Over what standard? Someone's paying; it's not public funds!" The village head didn't care. "Besides, it wasn't decided by me alone. Everyone agreed, right?"

The villagers chorused: "Right!"

With that, the two were ushered and pushed to the seats of honor at the head table. Before the bench was even warm, a familiar face walked in: it was Private First Class Chen Kefa from the platoon.

Tan Shuangxi suddenly remembered—Chen Kefa was from this village. He wore a clean set of "labor clothes," but he reeked of fish from head to toe. Obviously straight off the fishing boat.

Though only a few days apart, Chen Kefa greeted them like a long-lost reunion, first giving Tan Shuangxi a military salute, then moving in for a hug. Tan Shuangxi fled without returning the salute—this was his new uniform, issued after returning to Lingao! The Private saw everyone else backing away and could only grin sheepishly. He greeted the village head, then invited everyone to sit.

"This is your house?"

"That's right, my house." Chen Kefa grinned. "The courtyard is newly built. How is it? Not bad, right?"

The Private's house was quite large, an open-style three-sided compound. His wasn't a small family; he shared the courtyard with two uncles, three households living together, cooking and fishing as one. For fishermen, capital requirements were heavy, so such clan-style operations were quite common.

By Tan Shuangxi's standards, the food and drink were very lavish. Chicken, duck, fish, and meat—nothing was missing. Especially the seafood dishes, prepared in a dazzling variety. According to Chen Kefa, this was the handiwork of his Third Uncle-in-law—he had apprenticed at the Commercial Hall Restaurant in Bairen Town and now "did the rounds" on his own.

The liquor wasn't local homebrew either; they had specifically bought crates of Wenlan River beer from a nearby town and chilled them in well water. As for fruit brandy, soft drinks, and kvass, everything was fully stocked.

"This is too extravagant." Tan Shuangxi was somewhat shocked. Zhang Laicai was even more at a loss. Out of season for any festival—what was all this for? On the other hand, the village head, the stationed police, and other locals sharing the meal seemed perfectly at ease. Apparently, one meal was no longer a big deal for this prosperous village.

"Not extravagant. I'm just—what's the phrase—presenting Buddha with borrowed flowers, is that right?" Chen Kefa looked to the village's "culture person," the village accountant, who nodded with a smile and said, "Close enough."

"Let's go with that." Chen Kefa had already downed half a bottle of beer. "This banquet was originally to send off the village's new recruits..."

"New recruits?" Tan Shuangxi was somewhat puzzled. "Where are the new recruits?"

"Still at the docks sorting out the boat. They'll be here soon!" Chen Kefa said. "He's a fishing hand on my family's boat."

Zhang Laicai interjected: "Wasn't it your cousin's turn for this round of conscription?"

"That's right, it was supposed to be him." Chen Kefa was nonchalant. The Chen family had many people and sons locally, so besides Chen Kefa serving in the army, this time another son was due. According to age, it was Chen Kefa's cousin Chen Kecai. But Chen Kecai had just graduated from the "Mechanical Technician Training Class" and received his technician certificate, so the Chen family couldn't do without him. Hence the idea of finding a substitute came up.

"This is allowed?" Tan Shuangxi was somewhat surprised.

"What's not to allow? The county only says how many people the village has to send, not specifically who goes." The village head said bluntly. "The young man is willing too. Says there's no future in being a fishing hand. Joining the army is a good opportunity too."

Just then, several young men came in from outside. The Chen family patriarch immediately went up to greet them quite warmly.

"Look, the substitute has arrived." Zhang Laicai muttered in a low voice.

"What nonsense!" Tan Shuangxi hissed under his breath to scold him. "What kind of talk is that!" Though he also felt something wasn't quite right about this, there seemed nothing to say about it either.

"Come, come, these are the new recruits we're seeing off this time." The village head brought the young men before Tan Shuangxi and the others. Chen Kefa grinned even wider: "This is Sergeant Tan and Corporal Zhang. Say 'Hi, Squad Leaders!'"

Six young men formed a crooked line and called out together: "Hi, Squad Leaders!"

Tan and Zhang laughed and cried at the same time, hurrying to stand and return the salute.

"Everyone sit, sit." The village head kept urging everyone to take their seats, busying himself with toasting at each table alongside the Chen family patriarch.

Zhang Laicai asked: "Chen Kefa! This banquet is from your family?"

"My family's paying. Where would the village get this money?" Chen Kefa was quite proud. "My dad and two uncles all want me to leave the army and come back to work together. I'm not coming back—wind and waves are nothing compared to being a soldier! After my leave is over, I'm going back to the unit. Doesn't matter where we fight. Come, come, drink up!"

Several rounds of wine later, everyone warmed up and the conversation flowed. The village head was a local; due to Tan Shuangxi's grandmother, they even counted as distantly related. So they talked more. He chatted with Tan Shuangxi in Lingao dialect, showing off a bit of local superiority. But Tan Shuangxi, mindful that the stationed police officer was a northerner, insisted on answering in New Speech.

The conversation at the banquet table started from the host family. The village head said enviously: Chen Kefa's family was doing well now. Not only did they have two new fishing boats built in Hong Kong, but they'd also opened a seafood processing plant. Catches went straight from the boat to the plant for processing into various products. Far more profitable than selling fresh fish or salted goods. Especially their roasted fish fillet, which had become a county specialty.

"...The women in his family all work at the processing plant now. Their own fishing can't even keep up; they have to buy more at the harbor. Spanish mackerel gets oven-dried into fish fillets right at the factory, then sold to East Gate Market. Business is booming."

"Roasted fish fillets? In the past, the village used to make those too..." Tan Shuangxi remembered as a child visiting grandmother, she would roast fish jerky for him as a snack.

"This is not the same as before. You'll know when you taste it." The village head continued boasting.

As they spoke, a distinctive fragrance began wafting through the air. Villagers helping serve dishes brought out large wooden trays to each table. On them were enormous oil-paper packages stamped with the "Daya Chen's Fish Fillet" mark.

"Come, come, homemade, self-marketed. Best with drinks!" Chen Kefa peeled open the oil-paper wrapper with his hands. A rich aroma hit them. Inside were thin pressed sheets of roasted fish. "No chopsticks needed. Tear it with your hands—that's the real flavor!"

Tan Shuangxi took a piece and tore off a small strip to put in his mouth. Full ocean flavor, full salty-savory taste filled his palate. A few light chews unleashed endless delight. As a complement to drinks, it was indeed exquisite.
