# Chapter 2853: A Dilemma of a Letter

Thus, the matter went through the "Summary Procedure" like the various trivial disputes that occurred daily in East Gate Market. After the police arrived, the Qu family offered apologies, compensated for the damage to store items, and paid a fifty-yuan fine for "disturbing business order," bringing the matter to a close.

Of course, He Xiaoyue and Guo Xi'er also warned the Qu family group that this was Australian Song, not the Great Ming. If they did anything excessive to Zhou Suniang after returning, they would face legal sanctions. However, apart from this, there was really nothing else they could do.

When Zhou Suniang left, He Xiaoyue glanced at her, thinking of how she had taken such a great risk to come here for Wu Xinsheng, yet she herself had tried every means to decline. She couldn't help but feel guilty. Just as she opened her mouth to say some comforting words, Zhou Suniang turned and left before she could speak. He Xiaoyue watched as she disappeared at the end of the corridor, surrounded by several maids.

"What a mess!" Guo Xi'er let out a long sigh. "Zhou Suniang is really something! What's so good about Old Wu? It has to be him."

He Xiaoyue didn't speak. She felt there was something inappropriate and guilt-inducing about today's events.

Now that Zhou Suniang had gone back, she would inevitably suffer. Even though she was favored, a female family member going out privately was a "felony" in any wealthy household. The Madam had every justification to punish her—not to mention her protective talisman, Master Qu, was away.

Thinking of this, she felt even more guilty. If she had known earlier, she should have accepted the letter, saving her from risking trip after trip to deliver it.

However, if she really helped her connect with Wu Xinsheng, wouldn't the aftermath be even harder to clean up? Sigh, actually, if they just eloped, it would be clean and done with. The Qu family could only stare in anger...

While she was wavering, a discerning salesgirl had already brought fresh tea for guests to help them "calm their nerves."

The fragrance of the tea wafted through the studio, rich and aromatic, soothing their momentarily chaotic states of mind.

"A perfectly good day ruined!" Guo Xi'er continued to mutter continually. "I originally wanted to draw two more sketches this afternoon."

He Xiaoyue had no mood to chat. She casually pulled up the blinds. The sunlight was blindingly white, making her dizzy.

She suddenly felt a familiar fear—when she was young, her own mother had been ostracized by the first wife in the family. It was that feeling of being helpless, alone, and trembling with fear, afraid that others wouldn't love her anymore, wouldn't want her anymore, and that she would have to abandon all dignity just to kneel and survive...

He Xiaoyue vaguely felt she shouldn't think about it anymore.

She took a deep breath, shook her head, and was about to return to the design room when, in a glance, she discovered a paper edge sticking out from the crevice of the sofa in the reception room.

The color and pattern... it seemed to be the letter Zhou Suniang had just asked her to give to Wu Xinsheng.

Regardless of further thought, He Xiaoyue hurriedly pulled the paper out—it was indeed the letter! The envelope was the kind custom-made for wealthy families, with very subdued tones and patterns. There wasn't a single word on the cover, only Zhou Suniang's personal mark affixed to the seal.

The contents of the envelope felt very thin; there was likely only a single sheet of letter paper inside, with no additional enclosures.

This was probably stuffed in there deliberately by Zhou Suniang. He Xiaoyue thought to herself, *She still harbors that intention.* Sighing inwardly, she no longer felt as repulsed by the matter as before. After thinking for a moment, she stuffed the letter into her pocket.

She didn't tell Guo Xi'er about the letter. Not only would Guo be unable to come up with an idea, but she would also likely blab about it until the whole world knew.

Back in the design room, she immediately got busy. Recently, Wanzi Pavilion had hired Senator Liu Shuixin as a "Consultant" and was pushing "New Fashion." Besides meeting the needs of wealthy households, they also began to consider the "light luxury" demands of the upper-middle class of naturalized citizens. Following her creative direction, He Xiaoyue had been racking her brains drawing new design drafts.

Since the "Drizzle on Duckweed" design she first led achieved good performance, both the long and short versions had garnered considerable success—of course, the short version orders were mostly from female Senators and those close to Senators. The matter of skirt length simply couldn't be rushed.

However, He Xiaoyue had since become a key candidate for Liu Shuixin's cultivation. Anyone could read fashion books; copying styles from the old timeline would be enough for them to use for decades. But cultivating a "fashion sense"... that was a discipline both scientific and metaphysical. Designers like Guo Xi'er, who relied on flipping through *Reference Materials* and piecing things together, would be dime a dozen in the future, but individuals with a certain fashion intuition were hard to find.

Talents like He Xiaoyue were likely numerous among the naturalized citizens, just not yet discovered. When Pei Lixiu was in Lingao, she had said she would bring fashion magazines to Guangzhou to start a new wave of fashion and excavate fashion talents. Back then, Liu Shuixin had only echoed her sentiments, but now she was seriously considering it.

Liu Shuixin knew well that changing clothing habits wasn't something achieved overnight. She had always sneered at the rhetoric of some people claiming "changing customs must start with skirt length." The conservatism or openness of women's clothing was directly linked to social environment and social status. Women in the civilized world of the old timeline could unscrupulously wear short skirts and off-shoulder tops because, in that environment, such attire was ordinary in the eyes of others, and they wouldn't face moral criticism or physical attacks for it.

In today's Lingao, women's clothing had become much more open over the past ten years. While the trend-following effect brought by the Senate's power played a part, the most essential reason was the improvement of women's social status. He Xiaoyue's transformation was the best proof.

Changing customs was easy to say but hard to do. Lingao was a blank sheet of paper easy to draw on, but Guangzhou had deep-rooted traditional culture, and its public order couldn't compare to Lingao's.

Liu Shuixin pondered hard on how to open the market and how to "change customs." Promoting through Purple Ming Pavilion was the wrong path; this was normal clothing, and it shouldn't be too associated with the... special service industry of Purple Ming Pavilion, lest people be afraid to wear it out. Opening a shop in the Great World? It looked simple but had big problems; who would buy these things? Female family members of Guangzhou's wealthy households? They couldn't be counted on.

Liu Shuixin thought long and hard. Apart from opening a Guangzhou version of Wanzi Pavilion—which had some practical significance—she couldn't come up with other methods, so she had to shelve the matter for now.

Although there was no method yet, talents could be cultivated first. Under her instruction, He Xiaoyue was formally appointed by Wanzi Pavilion as an Assistant Designer to undergo systematic design knowledge study. Assistant Designer was a step up from her previous position as Trainee Designer.

This afternoon, Liu Shuixin was coming to "guide the work" at Wanzi Pavilion and incidentally check the "homework" she had assigned to He Xiaoyue.

What she was currently drawing on the drafting board was a women's outfit intended for sale in "New Areas" like Guangzhou. Thematically, it was "Han Element" fashion. This type of fashion was a common project for Wanzi Pavilion; He Xiaoyue had designed several before. But this time, Liu Shuixin emphatically raised the concept of sales regions: "We must fit the needs of customers in New Areas like Guangzhou."

This statement was worth pondering. It meant not only did it have to be "good-looking," "new style," and "contain traditional elements," but it also had to cater to "demand."

Yet this demand was the most elusive. Liu Shuixin had discussed concepts like "customer personas" and "cultural conflict" with her, but for He Xiaoyue, understanding and applying these concepts was still a bit too profound. No matter how she pondered, the resulting drafts were always lacking something.

"This Australian NewspEAK is really hard to understand." He Xiaoyue looked at the sketch on the drafting board and sighed. Let alone Liu Shuixin, even she herself was dissatisfied looking at it.

While she was worrying, the salesgirl pushed open the door of the design room again, peering in tentatively.

"What is it?" Guo Xi'er was startled.

"Master Wu is here!"

Now, both He Xiaoyue and Guo Xi'er revealed incredulous expressions: *Did these two arrange this?!*

After Wu Xinsheng returned, he had sent a liaison letter. Originally, besides bringing the female workers from the Nansha Mill back for training, he also brought two other female workers—they were scheduled to learn lace-making techniques at Wanzi Pavilion's garment factory to promote it as a household sideline industry upon their return.

But when he contacted them regarding business that time, Wu Xinsheng hadn't shown anything unusual, nor had he expressed interest in any customer.

Could this be just a coincidence? He Xiaoyue was full of suspicion.

Should she give the letter to him? In her heart, she sympathized greatly with Zhou Suniang. Zhou had gone to such lengths, risking danger time and again to transmit the letter. If she heard no response at all, wouldn't it be too cruel?

But if she gave him the letter, the situation would become uncontrollable. If it caused a disturbance, harming Zhou Suniang and Wu Xinsheng aside, she herself would be implicated.

She struggled internally for a long time, unsure whether to hand over the letter.

Before she could make up her mind, Wu Xinsheng had already arrived. Since leaving for Nansha, he had become thinner and darker, but his complexion was much sharper than when he was at Wanzi Pavilion. Upon entering the design room, he greeted them enthusiastically.

"Sister Xi!" "Xiaoyue!"

"Oh my, Brother Xinsheng!" Guo Xi'er didn't have the letter, nor did she have as many thoughts as He Xiaoyue. Seeing an old acquaintance, she immediately welcomed him warmly. "What brings you here?"

"Coming to catch up." Looking at Wu Xinsheng's expression, he seemed very happy, without a trace of worry. "Also coming to ask a favor."
