# Chapter 2815 Lingao Sights

What appeared before the Persian girl at Meimei Department Store were, first of all, the famous eight display windows. The large, all-glass transparent display cases alone were unmatched anywhere outside Lingao; even within Lingao, these set the record for size and number.

Drawing on old-timeline commercial display design, each window was an artistic and commercialized representation of a life scene, changed according to the seasons. From a bedroom with a woman in sexy sleepwear and lingerie with beautiful bedding, to a kitchen with lovely linen aprons, gleaming Australian-style cookware, and fine white porcelain tableware; from groups of girls in Australian-style short and long skirts holding stylish new parasols, to classical beauties wearing traditional styles but tailored the Australian way in "Han-style" fashion—countless people formed their first impression and endless longing for the Australian way of life through these windows.

Particularly worth mentioning were the various wooden mannequins serving as protagonists in the windows. Since display mannequins had never appeared in this timeline, commissioning this batch had troubled the responsible staff.

Clothing display mannequins fell roughly into two types: the traditional "realistic" style and the more fashionable "abstract body" style that came later. The biggest difference was that the former had "head and face," trying to imitate real human models, while the latter was just an abstract human form with a "torso."

Whether one or the other, difficulties arose when production began. Traditional Chinese human figures were basically only two types: divine Buddhist statues and "wengzhong" stone figures in front of tombs—both with fixed poses and expressions. So when the design drawings first came out, the figures made by the woodworking factory's workers never quite captured the essence.

If they asked Trini's students to make them, the results were exquisite, but they treated it as art—productions were too slow for mass manufacturing.

In the end, local puppet makers in Lingao were found. Under guidance from Trini's students, they finally produced this batch of poseable human-shaped clothing racks that astonished locals. Due to the superb carving and lifelike images made from old-timeline photographs, rumors circulated that these wooden figures were originally live people whom the Baldies had enchanted into this form.

What most captivated the Persian girl's heart was the display showing an Australian-style walk-in closet. The lady of the house, wearing a sexy nightgown, stood before an L-shaped floor-to-ceiling wardrobe selecting clothes. The wardrobe was not only lined with rows of beautiful long and short skirts and tops, but also featured a row of horizontal shelves facing the viewer, displaying various purses, backpacks, and handbags. Some bags were real leather; some were simple canvas. Some sparkled; some had subtle colors. But without exception, every one showed careful design and exquisite craftsmanship. Every time she saw this scene, Zahra couldn't help casting herself into it for a delightful fantasy.

Past Meimei Department Store came the Lao Jiefu Silk Bureau, specializing in high-end silk and custom tailoring. This was a private shop, though it had exchanged shares for technical and equipment upgrades from the Light Industry Department. Through the glass, bolts of beautiful silks introduced from Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Nanjing were displayed in rows, including some "internal" varieties. They were also made into various lovely clothes and decorations: capes, headscarves, dresses, even tablecloths, curtains, and pillowcases. The shawl Zahra now wore had been bought here when Senator Xu accompanied them shopping last time.

Next to Lao Jiefu was an authentic native merchant, one of Lingao's largest outside traders: "Qionghai Treasures Shop." The Qionghai headquarters was in a quiet area a few streets away, occupying a large tract of land but mainly engaged in wholesale of bulk goods. This "Treasures Shop" opened in the bustling commercial district mainly sold ginseng, furs, pearls, and various "Liaodong goods" Li Luoyu obtained from Liaodong, along with bird's nests, shark fins, and other precious Southeast Asian specialties resold from the two East India Companies. Zahra couldn't understand the radish-like plants with long whiskers displayed in the window, but that didn't stop her from understanding the astonishing prices above them.

Across the street were the First Food Store run by the Agriculture Committee and Light Industry Department. Its main offerings were various candies, pastries, prepared foods, convenience foods, and high-end meat and seafood products. To be approachable and enticing, the First Food Store had opened a street-facing sales window selling small packages of candies and pastries as snacks. From time to time, children or young women handed over circulation vouchers and received bags of their long-desired candy treats.

Even for someone like Zahra, who had access to the Senate's special supply stores, these dazzling, eye-catching goods still made her overwhelmed and full of desire to buy. After all, the South Sea Farm's special supply store mostly sold ingredients; it didn't have candy snacks like these.

Beside the First Food Store, facing Qionghai across the street, was the flagship "Runshitang" General Store of a local Lingao merchant family. Runshitang's facade was much more traditional. Through the glass, one could see rows of neatly arranged Chinese medicine cabinets. Stepping over the high wooden threshold, one would see several resident physicians examining patients lined up. Walking at the junction between the two shops, one could smell a mixture of candy's sweetness and the pungent scent of Chinese medicines—rather peculiar.

Walking farther, crossing a cross street perpendicular to East Gate Avenue, came the just-opened "Dongfeng Famous Carriage Sales and Service Company." As the first Dongfeng Carriage 4S shop designed and opened according to Director Hong's wishes, the section facing East Gate Avenue was mainly for the display and sales of two-wheeled Dongfeng carriages and four-wheeled Hongqi carriages. The entrance on the cross street led to the department responsible for maintenance and servicing. Particularly worth mentioning: to promote the products, Director Hong introduced the old-timeline concept of car show models, specifically purchasing two large Western maidservants as part of the carriage display environment, attracting enthusiastic gawking from the masses.

Carriages were rarely purchased even in Lingao. Due to climate, horses were extremely expensive to keep in Lingao with persistently high mortality. So mostly only "official" entities used them. Even Senators couldn't afford the expense of keeping horses and mostly used rickshaws. So this shop essentially served only Senate-affiliated agencies; private customers were few and far between. Director Hong running this shop was essentially losing money. But even at a loss, he had to keep it open—selling carriages was all about face. Even without a single customer, the storefront had to be maintained.

Zahra didn't spend time crossing the street to observe her fellow maidservants because her destination was near: the Cooperative General Society, renowned as the "Crystal Dragon Palace" and once featured in the widely circulated "Eight Sights of Lingao" ranking. As Lingao's first large-scale department store, the Cooperative General Society's atrium roof was one huge iron-framed glass dome. When sunlight shone through the glass, it illuminated the three floors brilliantly, making each glass-fronted treasure case sparkle with enchanting radiance—evoking the treasure-filled Crystal Dragon Palace of the Eastern Sea. As a landmark of Lingao, this was where Sonya and the Persian girl had agreed to meet.

With the new round of commercial district renovations largely complete, specialized stores represented by Meimei Department Store and First Food Store had risen, greatly challenging the Cooperative General Society's status. To maintain its leading position in Lingao's commercial system, the Cooperative General Society had also launched its own renovation and expansion project. While keeping the traditional Crystal Palace as a wholesale window for outside merchants, they had requisitioned adjacent land and begun construction of a new building more focused on retail and lifestyle consumption.

According to the plan, this new building would be an unprecedented super-tall structure for this timeline. The commercial floors were planned at six; from the seventh floor was a club for elite clientele. The ninth through twelfth floors and the rooftop observation deck were planned as Senate-exclusive venues for external hospitality and internal activities, along with several high-rise panoramic apartments. To accommodate this design, the Commercial Department had already coordinated multiple times with the Machinery Division, preparing to install Bairen Town's first scenic-view elevator here.

Having its own club wasn't the Commerce Department's sudden whim. The success of the Farm Café was an important factor, and the recent battle for development rights to Xuetian Manor had further inflamed the issue. The Farm Café, opened shortly after D-Day, had successfully combined a nice natural environment with nostalgia for the old timeline, becoming the Senators' de facto socializing and consumption venue. Wu Nanhai and the Agriculture Committee not only gained decent economic returns but, leveraging their home advantage, had converted it into a major lobbying platform outside the chamber.

Using the café as a venue and dispensing constant small favors, Old Wu had successfully rallied and bought off a large batch of soy sauce Senators. This was abundantly clear in recent BBS and Senate discussions about Xuetian Manor. What's more, a group of people openly encouraged Wu Nanhai to run for the next term's Senate Chairman or Speaker, putting the matter even more plainly on the table. Beyond jealousy, under the behind-the-scenes instigation and incitement of a batch of homebound factions, the commercial system decided to build its own territory and strive for a voice.

For the Persian girl, these power struggles among the big shots were still far away. What she saw now was just a big construction site enclosed by walls. However, the thick gray-white cement frameworks rising from the ground and crisscrossing showed this would not be an ordinary place. The Senate would once again demonstrate its magical, incredible power to the world. Considering the building height, the new structure would use standard frame construction. Combined with the dazzling debut of the elevator, this was truly an epoch-making event in this timeline's architecture.
