# Chapter 2822 Re-bottling

"...Right now, the cultural market on the mainland is the Sahara Desert, thirsting for the downpour of arts and entertainment!"

The dearth of entertainment life was something all Senators who had deeply engaged with native commoner life felt. Slightly older Senators, if they'd come from rural areas or remote county towns, had also personally experienced severe deprivation of spiritual and cultural life.

When farming was slack, people gathered to shoot the breeze, gamble, go to market... that was roughly all of rural entertainment. When traveling film projection teams came to show movies, or when hosts of weddings or funerals hired performers—that was considered a major artistic event. Going to town or the county seat to watch a who-knows-how-many-times-rerun film was something that happened only once or twice a year. As for buying books, magazines, or even newspapers—you had to go to town or the county seat.

This deprivation was like drought-stricken land. Any artistic work you poured in, as long as it didn't exceed their comprehension, would be absorbed indiscriminately—with especially obvious effects.

In the 17th century, the situation was similar. Of course, for the turbulent, disordered north and central regions, the need for survival was greater. But Ming still had quite a few peaceful areas. In these regions with relatively stable social order, where commoners could manage to get by, they still had a certain demand for spiritual life.

Cultural products manufactured in serialized-drama mode could be updated regularly. Language-based arts could practically follow current events. Subtly paving the way for the Senate. Dingding painted this picture for the Council of State: In teahouses and theaters in Ming cities, at storytelling stands in township markets, tens of thousands of grassroots performers would use various folk art forms to tell artistic works approved by the Senate one or two months earlier.

This picture was indeed beautiful, immediately capturing the leaders' attention. The special nature of cultural products was their self-propagating quality. Once a certain coverage was achieved in a region, they would spread spontaneously—unstoppable.

Seeing the picture-painting succeeded, Dingding was greatly encouraged and immediately added fuel to the fire. In terms of content: the two principles of "Promote the happy life in Australia-Song, reflect the dark rule of Ming" were subdivided into multiple themed serialized dramas. *Short-Hairs' Amazing Tales* was a series of criminal investigation stories, using plots to embody Australia-Song's advanced justice, investigation, and trial systems, inducing audiences to resonate with "This would be another miscarriage of justice in Ming," and fantasize about "Australia-Song is the world of light and justice." *Pleasant Village Stories* was a comedy reflecting rural life, taking the path of replacing scholar-beauty romances with rustic love stories, but details revealed how different Australia-Song's countryside was: three meals of unlimited rice daily, rice yields of over a thousand *jin* per *mu*, fair and reasonable land taxes, convenient public ox-carts... To enhance credibility, some unfulfilled but simple new agricultural techniques also appeared in the plots—as long as someone got curious and tried them, they'd be thoroughly convinced of the content's truth.

Dingding introduced several cases in one breath. Seeing the leaders all gazing off into space, he couldn't help wondering if his speech had a hypnotic quality. Actually, quite a few had indeed sunk into distant memories, immersed in reveries from when they'd watched American dramas like *Growing Pains*.

Culture's influence far exceeds science—this was undeniable fact.

Clap, clap, clap—someone in the meeting room began applauding. Dingding nearly teared up. Someone who understands me... Sikade? What did this have to do with him?

Sikade first put a high hat on Dingding as "pioneer of modern arts," then sincerely stated that the Colonial Trade Department's stations in Tianjin, Hangzhou, Shandong, and Later Jin would do their best to recruit talent for the Mainland Cultural Infiltration Strategy and support the dissemination of artistic works. Then, amid Dingding's tearful thanks, he diplomatically made a suggestion: "There should be content in the serialized dramas reflecting Australia-Song's commercial activities. People say we 'Short-Hair bandits' are good at all crafts and especially skilled at commerce—we should let them see just how skilled we are. Not only are we good at making money, but everyone who does business with us can make money too. That way, people will definitely come with goods to trade. Why not add the goods we need right into the scripts, haha..."

Damn, Sikade you profiteer—a hundred thousand alpacas stampeded through the Senators' minds. But cursing aside, a massive product placement campaign was thus unveiled.

Ma Qianzhu returned from the restroom, shaking his hands as he walked into the conference room, and found the lively discussion still ongoing. *Pleasant Village Stories* had already evolved into *I Love Xiyang Town*. Ma Qianzhu quickly patted Xiao Zishan's shoulder and whispered something, then both laughed happily.

Ma Qianzhu walked back to his seat with a smile: "Let's stop here. For specific artistic creation issues, please discuss privately with Dingding or start a new thread on the BBS. Don't take up everyone's time here." This kind of topic where everyone could chime in required constant steering of discussion direction; otherwise, it could drag on for days without conclusion.

Then he changed tack, saying to Dingding in a questioning tone: "As a strategic direction, I don't see any problem. The main work is all in cultural product content, which isn't what this meeting is reviewing anyway. But as a proposal, yours seems to have no budget."

"I only covered the first strategic direction just now—cultural carrier delivery. Everyone's valuable suggestions can be discussed privately." Even in his triumphant state, Dingding couldn't resist putting in another plug for himself before turning around. His right hand swept through the air and pressed heavily on the table. "This proposal of mine—I don't need budget, only policy!"

This gesture was a classic shot from *Lenin in 1917*. Dingding had rehearsed it thousands of times in his mind. Originally, he'd wanted to finish the whole story, then end with this stylish move and the resounding words "Don't need money" to win a round of amazement. But the Chairman's unconventional question had forced it out early, halving the impact.

Simply put, in the process of delivering cultural products, commercial operations would be used to make money, subsidizing the upstream collection, organization, and processing stages. After Dingding finished his cost and revenue estimates, several leaders with some financial sense had their eyes glazing over. Dumping books could make money—everyone could understand that. But how could folk arts and drama make money? By charging copyright fees to performers and troupes?

Intellectual property was often ignored even in the old timeline, let alone the 17th century with basically no such awareness. Many "century-old brands'" multiple-sibling phenomenon in China had fully illustrated this point. As for "stealing skills," that could even become a "legend."

The scripts painstakingly created by the Propaganda Department might sell for a good price at first, but once started, they'd most likely be widely pirated. Dingding shouldn't expect to receive any income.

Ma Qianzhu looked at Wu De, then at Cheng Dong. The confusion written all over their faces showed they didn't believe Dingding's plan either. Their silence also indicated that neither Finance nor Planning wanted to offend anyone. Who knew what work Dingding had done beforehand, or maybe they felt the whole thing didn't matter anyway.

Cheng Dong's thoughts at this moment were indeed as Ma Qianzhu imagined. Poking holes in Dingding's plan from a budget rationality angle wouldn't be difficult, but what was the necessity? If Dingding couldn't find money and the plan fell through, Finance Ministry had no losses. When necessary, it could even be used as a bargaining chip.

While Ma Qianzhu's gaze wandered, Wu De was actually also observing the audience's expressions. Finance and the Chairman both silent at once—could there have been some dirty deal beforehand? Anyway, this matter had little to do with Wu De either way, wouldn't consume any materials—let Propaganda handle it.

For the leaders with real power present, Dingding's proposal was essentially theoretical. Never mind him voluntarily requesting no funding—even if he did, it wouldn't cost much budget, negligible to overall finances. As for results, since there was no budget, there'd be no performance evaluation either. Moreover, cultural infiltration work had been done to varying degrees through various channels over the years. Though this proposal integrated things at the strategic level and proposed some entirely new operational models, in essence, it was somewhat reheating cold rice.

The prospects were tempting, with sufficient operability, but essentially there didn't seem to be much need for discussion.

Dingding looked somewhat awkwardly at the silent conference room. All the passionate rhetoric he'd prepared had no chance to be deployed. He could only swallow and continue his introduction. In an era without communication tools, except for paper novels and similar carriers that could be delivered remotely, all other information exchange depended on personnel mobility. Therefore, in promoting personnel exchange, Dingding listed over a dozen plans in one breath.

"...Establish a study-abroad system to attract mainland youth, including five steps: selection, preparatory, study, employment, and return—letting young people from Ming personally experience Australia-Song life..."

"...Expand Australia-Song Postal Service's business scope, establishing post offices in places like Tianjin and Shanghai where conditions permit, promoting civilian exchange between Ming and Australia-Song..."

"...Establish short-term arts training courses at overseas stations, continuously passing Australia-Song cultural products on to traditional performers..."

Listening, Ma Qianzhu began to smile. This section sounded like a lot, but actually little was new. Most was already in other work plans—like postal service. Li Yunxing's Postal Bureau had already opened branch offices in Kaohsiung and Jeju Island and was currently cooperating with Qiwei on postal agency business for Ming and other East Asian countries. Whether Dingding had conspired with these departments beforehand or just copied others' plans from work briefings was unknown.
