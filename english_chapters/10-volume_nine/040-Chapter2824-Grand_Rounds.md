# Chapter 2824 Grand Rounds

"You're right." Dingding couldn't help feeling deflated.

"Just a small personal view—naturally you should seek cooperation from other departments, but you should also build on your own unit's resources..." He waved his hand, indicating not to interrupt. "I know, you're going to say you just push pens with no resources. Actually, your resources aren't small either. Our mouthpieces are all in your hands—how can you say you have no resources?"

"That's how it's said, but the power to decide propaganda policy isn't in my hands." Dingding was equally blunt. "Everyone calls me Goebbels, but what kind of Propaganda Minister am I? I can't even decide what stories to run—everything has to be decided by Senate meetings..."

"Can't put it that way." Ma Qianzhu habitually drew out his tone. "Newspapers, magazines—these are gold mines. You should dig more into their potential value. I think many departments and institutions would like their work to be discovered and understood by everyone..."

If there were an election for the most respected Senator, Shi Niaoren would definitely be in second place looking up at first. Feudal superstitious titles like "Divine Healer," "Medicine King," and "Medical Immortal" could no longer describe his status. According to his ambition, all therapy prefixes in "Australian Medicine" textbooks could be changed to his name. Of course, this was impossible—at minimum, half the naming rights would have to be split with other livestock-raising Senators.

At this moment, it was the weekly Shi Niaoren Time, meaning the Bairen General Hospital inpatient department grand rounds. Since this system was established, livestock-raising Senators privately called it "Senator Shi Holding Court."

Dr. Shi hadn't initially realized his grand rounds held such significance. Later, as the Health Department and Bairen General Hospital expanded in scale and medical personnel increased, with the deliberate and unconscious involvement of numerous naturalized-citizen medical staff, these rounds took on an increasingly strong ritualistic quality.

Every Monday morning, grand rounds began, as always, with a high-pitched cry from Zhang Ziyi, the Lingao General Hospital Nursing Director and Chief Nurse: "Dr. Shi's rounds!"

With this call, all wards immediately fell into wordless tension. Each ward's head nurses, duty nurses, and inpatient doctors immediately tidied their appearance. They parted left and right, standing in the corridor in order of education, seniority, and hierarchy.

As the fifth-floor elevator doors of the inpatient building slowly opened—to accommodate patient transport requirements, the newly built Bairen General Hospital inpatient building was also equipped with elevators—Shi Niaoren's not-so-tall figure appeared at the corridor's end. Fu Qiliang and several other Senator physicians immediately gathered around, greeting with familiarity or warmth: "Good morning, Dr. Shi!" In the hospital, everyone preferred using "Director" rather than "Minister." After all, this title felt warmer, more like "one of us."

After Shi Niaoren exchanged pleasantries with the Senator physicians, he began his rounds along the corridor. Scores of naturalized-citizen doctors standing apprehensively on both sides of the corridor, along with an even larger number of female nurses, all bowed together, welcoming the Senator physician into the ward. This scene always reminded Shi Niaoren of emperors setting out in costume dramas, which was why he never tired of it.

Actually, he just glanced casually at the ward rooms. In terms of specialty, Shi Niaoren wasn't exactly an authority on conventional hospital departments like surgery and internal medicine, since his field was "infectious diseases." But back then he was the oldest, and his University of Pennsylvania (Perelman) School of Medicine MD degree was indeed impressive—which was how he'd gained enough credibility to assume the Health leadership position.

Of course, these years of high-intensity work had also rapidly increased Dr. Shi's clinical experience. It was just that due to objective material conditions, many diseases still couldn't be treated. This gave him some regret. However, in infectious diseases, Dr. Shi had made considerable professional advances—if his mentor traversed here now, he'd probably be outmatched.

Today's focus was the "Combat Injury Ward." Originally, the Health Department had no such discipline. Only after the Mainland Campaign began and casualties surged did this discipline open, at the strong recommendation of Senator physicians at the front lines.

Bairen General Hospital's Combat Injury Department wasn't large, because the biggest, most specialized hospital in this system was the Army General Hospital at Maniao. This one in Bairen was mainly for research, headed by Fu Qiliang, who'd returned from the front.

Today, in the duty doctor classroom, Fu Qiliang was about to lecture for residents in training. This was another major invention of the Senate's health system. After all, their own trained doctors had too short study periods, and gaps were too many—they could only take this "work while studying" path.

Though Dr. Shi wasn't particularly interested in this department, as Director, it was his responsibility to personally visit.

The classroom was packed, everyone holding their breath and staring.

"Let's look at this case." Fu Qiliang switched a transparency on the slide projector. This projector was produced by the Optical Equipment Factory, a replacement for projectors they couldn't manufacture themselves. The thing was structurally very simple—essentially a big light bulb plus a lens set. Its biggest advantage was that supplies could be self-produced.

Cases and photos were photo-developed onto glass slides. As for text and images, that was even simpler—just hand-drawn directly. A well-made set of slides could be used for ten or twenty years.

"Patient 11, male, 17 years old, shot in the chest. Fragment entered above the sternum, causing a penetrating neck wound. After emergency hemostasis, evacuated to field hospital. Under field conditions, X-ray couldn't be taken. This is his surgical exploration result. Everyone discuss—based on this probing, how should this patient's condition be assessed? How should treatment and nursing proceed?"

After a bout of whispering, naturalized-citizen doctors began raising hands to speak.

"If the carotid artery was hit, he wouldn't have made it to the field hospital..."

"Since there's no suffocation, the trachea should be uninjured..."

"The criterion is whether blood foam is sprayed during breathing..."

"There'd also be violent coughing..."

"Local cleaning, removing foreign matter, avoiding airway obstruction..."

Fu Qiliang felt both gratified and frustrated. Gratified that naturalized-citizen doctor training was showing some effect—especially those who'd been through battlefield rescues. Their treatment plans looked presentable; obviously they'd encountered similar wounds. Frustrated because most still knew the "what" without knowing the "why"—couldn't think from an anatomical perspective about what tissues were there, what injuries were possible, then propose structured investigation approaches.

Fu Qiliang shook his head slightly. Had to start from basics again. He moved the human anatomy chart to the blackboard's center and tapped with the pointer: "Who can tell me what organs are in this area?"

Another bout of whispering. The naturalized-citizen doctors' habit of not daring to speak made Fu Qiliang quite frustrated. Sometimes they clearly knew the answers but just didn't dare answer, preferring to exchange privately. Under Fu Qiliang's encouraging gaze and increasingly dark expression, someone finally raised a hand: "Blood vessels, trachea, and esophagus."

"Very good." Fu Qiliang appropriately encouraged. "Theoretically, a fragment passing through could injure all three. We need to assess them in order of importance. Everyone just said: vascular damage causes major bleeding. Tracheal damage causes suffocation. This case happens to be the third kind—esophageal damage—which is why the patient could hold on two days traveling from Guilin to the hospital. Since we've identified the damage, who can describe the treatment plan?"

"Double-layer inverted suture..." This time someone quickly raised a hand.

"If conditions permit, drainage tube should be placed..."

"Battlefield wounds usually aren't just simple cuts. Debridement and trimming are likely needed..."

"Clean subcutaneous foreign matter, watch for fragments, dirt, residual tissue, emergency gauze, and other foreign objects that easily enter wounds..."

Fu Qiliang nodded. Once theory was solved, the rich clinical experience of those naturalized-citizen doctors who'd been on the battlefield began to take effect. This clinical experience was extremely valuable. "Veterans teaching newcomers" largely depended on these doctors who knew the "what" but not the "why."

"In this case, the patient reached Zhaoqing and had esophageal suturing surgery immediately. Now post-op—what nursing work should be done?" Fu Qiliang turned his gaze to the nurses.

"Timely dressing changes, monitor temperature changes, watch for post-op infection..."

"Should be fasting, right..."

The nurse girls were much bolder than the naturalized-citizen doctors. Daily patient care had made their personalities much more forthright. Plus Senator Fu Qiliang's looks weren't bad—second only to Dr. Hippo, who'd gone to Sanya. Dr. Hippo's first wife was a nurse just like them, so...

Fu Qiliang smiled, thanking the nurse girls for their answers and burning gazes.

"After esophageal damage, once esophageal leakage occurs, strongly irritating gastric contents and bacteria-laden oral secretions and food rapidly enter the mediastinum through the breach, causing severe mediastinal infection. Moreover, since the mediastinum is loose connective tissue, plus negative pressure and cardiac pulsation, inflammation easily spreads rapidly, even eroding through the pleura into the chest cavity... In short, consequences are very serious! Therefore, such patients should maintain a seated posture, fasting and no water, reducing esophageal leakage risk."

"This patient ultimately didn't survive. Despite taking sulfonamide anti-inflammatory drugs, he died of severe purulent mediastinitis. I didn't have time to perform an autopsy to determine the cause, but through inquiry, I can basically confirm the main reason was infection caused by the patient eating on the medical ship, creating mediastinitis before surgery. Regrettably, this young man survived Ming army artillery fire but died from field ration crackers. I want everyone to remember this lesson firmly."
