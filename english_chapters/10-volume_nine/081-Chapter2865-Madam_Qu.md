# Chapter 2865: Madam Qu

Xia Zhongde returned to his study, physically and mentally exhausted. This bail had cost him much effort, and even more money. Only then had he made a connection. Although he had only bought a few words, they had turned the tide and allowed him to successfully process the bail.

The bail was processed, but the matter wasn't over. Although Xia Zhongde had never been a litigation master before, he had been a steward specifically dealing with government offices under the Great Ming. He was very familiar with official matters. After arriving in Lingao, he had specially studied the Australians' various laws and regulations. Whether he understood them or not, at least he had memorized them all by rote.

Currently, although the legal wife and others had been bailed, the case wasn't closed. Zhou Suniang was still in police custody. Who knew what other "inappropriate" things she might say?

With the case unresolved, the legal wife and others remained "suspects" who could be remanded and re-interrogated at any time. Once prosecuted and brought to court, prison time was inevitable.

Even if the legal wife and others "got what they deserved," he would have no face to face Master Qu. His own livelihood would also be finished.

What to do?

In the Great Ming, spending money on bribes could have silenced her in prison. That wouldn't work with the Australians. Things had to be done "according to law."

By following the law, he had managed to get people bailed out. Now, how could he make the legal wife's case dissipate like smoke?

Just as he was pondering, a servant came to report: the Legal Wife requested his presence.

Xia Zhongde straightened his attire and followed the servant into the inner residence.

Madam Qu had already bathed and changed clothes, but her hair wasn't dry, only loosely pinned in a bun. These few days of imprisonment had given her a wan complexion.

She was a noble lady from a great family, pampered since childhood. After marrying into the Qu family, she was famous for her skill in household management: clear in rewards and punishments, decisive in judgment, and ruthless in methods. She kept the large household in perfect order. No matter how many concubines and maids the family had, each was managed to be submissive under her hand, yet she could avoid her husband's resentment and earn the reputation of "virtuous."

Xia Zhongde had served in the Qu household for many years and knew her methods. Coming before her, he held his breath and concentrated, not daring to be the slightest bit lax.

"Master Xia, please sit."

"Yes, thank you, Madam."

"This time I've really troubled you!" Madam Qu said.

"I don't deserve such words. It's all due to Madam's deep blessings."

"Master Xia, you've been in the household for many years now. You're an old hand who came along from the beginning. And we're in this Hair Rebel territory, all in the same boat. How exactly should this case be concluded?"

Her tone was extremely calm, yet her eyes revealed a trace of guilt and a hint of panic.

Xia Zhongde understood her point of pain: the halo of household management she had built over the years had been shattered by Zhou Suniang. She herself was implicated in the case—whether in the Great Ming or here with the Australians, getting entangled in such a lawsuit could bankrupt a family. Most critically, the master was away on the mainland. Originally, he wasn't expected back for several months. Because of this case, a telegram had already been sent to him, disrupting his itinerary and business. Moreover, even if he received the telegram and immediately went to Shanghai to book a ship ticket, it would still be at least a week before he could return. During this time, there was absolutely no one to consult.

The Qu family master and wife had seven or eight children between legitimate and concubine-born. The eldest son was only sixteen. The rest were either girls or young children—all unreliable.

"Madam, please be at ease," Xia Zhongde bowed. "Although this case is dangerous, there's no great peril."

"Please elaborate."

"Yes!" Xia Zhongde had already calculated many times. However, before speaking, he needed to ask clearly.

"This student is bold to ask: these few days with the Australians, what has Madam said? I must know everything clearly in order to plan."

"What else could I say? Nothing but old accounts!" Though the words were calm, fear showed on her face. Needless to say, these few days of interrogation had been hard to endure.

The old cases Zhou Suniang had exposed were two: one was that the legal wife had beaten a concubine to death while administering household punishment; the other was that the legal wife had secretly ordered someone to dispose of a maid who had violated household rules, putting her to death.

"Regarding these two matters, Madam must have told the Australian police about both?"

"Yes." Madam Qu looked ashamed. When first summoned, she had been calm and composed, her heart unmoved by the impending interrogation. Unexpectedly, the Australians broke down her composure in just a few rounds.

What happened next she couldn't quite remember. She only remembered it being all a blur, losing the distinction between day and night. The interrogators kept changing, going over old matters repeatedly. Her usually sharp mind became muddled. She answered whatever was asked, saying many things that shouldn't have been said.

"This Zhou concubine is truly my nemesis!" Madam Qu gnashed her teeth. Thinking it over, everything traced back to her. Previously, she had handled these groups of concubines and maids with practiced ease. Yet whenever she encountered Zhou Suniang, a nameless fire would rise, and she would do many rash things—yet she never went all the way and disposed of her cleanly!

"Madam, please don't panic. Just tell me everything you said to the Australians, so I can consider the situation." After speaking, he gestured, "Please dismiss the attendants."

"Yes." Madam nodded. This matter involved old murder cases. The fewer people who knew, the better—even close confidants.

Under normal circumstances, she would never let herself be alone in a room with a man. But now she couldn't be bothered with such proprieties.

She dismissed the attendants and roughly recounted the interrogation contents. Xia Zhongde had always had an excellent memory. He didn't take notes, just listened silently.

Of these two matters, he knew about beating the concubine to death. He had personally handled the official paperwork, finally reporting it as "sudden death from acute illness," and had her taken out and buried to close the matter. But disposing of the maid was news to him. Hearing Madam describe it now, he secretly felt alarmed: *What ruthless methods this Madam has!*

"...These two matters are both old history. Who knows where that rotten hoof heard about them!" Madam Qu gnashed her teeth. "Most likely those two cheap maids Fuyue and Ruilan!"

Seeing her gnashing her teeth, Xia Zhongde hurriedly advised:

"Now is not the time for making more trouble. If Madam wants to deal with them, it's not too late to wait until things have settled."

"You're right." Madam Qu exhaled a murky breath. "Please continue."

Xia Zhongde thought for a moment and said: "Although the people have returned, the Australian police probably aren't willing to let this go. They'll continue investigating these two cases. Now that they have confessions, they still need physical evidence and witness testimonies..."

Being bailed wasn't being declared innocent. She still had to stand trial in court. If the evidence was conclusive when the time came, Madam couldn't avoid prison time—and if it truly came to that, he needn't continue being a Private Secretary; he might as well pack his things and leave.

At this point, Madam Qu's expression noticeably tensed.

"...Fortunately, both these cases occurred under Ming rule. Time has passed and circumstances have changed. Although a few people know, it's all uncorroborated testimony, and there aren't even any aggrieved parties. Zhou Suniang merely reported based on hearsay; it doesn't count as evidence..."

"But the confessions..."

"No matter how iron-boned someone is, what confession can't be extracted in the hands of constables and bailiffs? The Australians know this themselves. So conviction based solely on confession isn't acceptable."

Simply put, the court also understood that uncorroborated evidence couldn't stand alone and conviction would be difficult, which was why they had agreed to grant him bail. So now he had confidence to say "although dangerous, there's no great peril."

But risks still existed—namely, Nanny Bao and Cheng Wu, the legal wife's confidants who had been arrested at the same time. Although he hadn't spoken to them yet, they had probably spilled everything like beans from a bamboo tube.

Confessions might be uncorroborated evidence, but as long as the confessions of the three people could corroborate each other, it became what the Australians called an "evidence chain." Xia Zhongde knew the Australians placed the most emphasis on the "evidence chain" when handling cases. If this chain of evidence fit perfectly, it wouldn't be so easy to muddle through.

"In that case, what should we do now?" Madam Qu asked anxiously. "Who knows when the Master will return..."

"Distant water cannot quench a nearby fire." Xia Zhongde knew clearly that even if the Master returned home immediately, it wouldn't help. True, the Master had some connections among the high-ranking naturalized officials, but these high-level cadres would most likely be unwilling to wade into this muddy water. Unless they could connect with a Senator. But why would a Senator stand up for the Qu family?

"How about we go back?" Madam Qu was in a panic. "At worst, we don't want the money!"

"No, no, absolutely not!" Xia Zhongde quickly shook his head. "Three thousand yuan is nothing, but the Master's entire family fortune is in Lingao. If you flee after bail, wouldn't the family business be ruined!"

Madam Qu covered her face and wept: "Had I known it would come to this, why did we come to Lingao! Staying nicely in the Great Ming, there wouldn't have been any trouble! That damned old coffin! Wuwuwu..."

Xia Zhongde felt very awkward and could only offer a few words of consolation.

Madam Qu cried a few times and composed herself. She said: "The Master hasn't returned. I've lost all sense of what to do. Please help me come up with a plan. Get us safely through the current crisis. There will be rewards for you afterward." With that, she stood up, took out a pair of heavy gold bracelets from the Japanese lacquer mother-of-pearl cabinet, and placed them on the table.

"A small token of appreciation."

But Xia Zhongde didn't reach for them: "I appreciate Madam's generosity in my heart. There will be many places requiring expenses ahead. Please keep these bracelets, Madam; there may be other uses."

Madam Qu understood his meaning and didn't stand on ceremony: "In that case, Master Xia, whatever you need for entertainment and expenses, just tell me."

"What needs to be done right now are two things. First, Nanny Bao and Cheng Wu must be kept under watch. No more unexpected changes—especially, they mustn't have second thoughts."

Madam Qu nodded.

"Second, the old servants in the household, especially the old servants around Madam, need to be kept secure to avoid further issues. As for Fuyue and Ruilan, I don't know what they know or how much they know, but they must also be kept in hand. The entire household must keep inside words in and outside words out."

"Those two have been old servants in the household for over ten years. They know quite a few things. And they've always been close with Zhou Suniang..." Madam Qu said grimly.

"Madam!"

"It's fine. I know what's prudent." Madam Qu smiled. "I can still distinguish between priorities."
