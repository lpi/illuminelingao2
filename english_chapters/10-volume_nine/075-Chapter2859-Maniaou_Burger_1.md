# Chapter 2859: Ma'niao Burger (1)

Tan Shuangxi clutched the photography coupon tightly, his heart swelling with gratitude. Without her help, today's outing would likely have been for nothing.

Bringing his parents to Bairen Town had not been easy. The difficulty lay not in transportation, but in convincing them to "go into the city" at all. His parents were traditional country folk who harbored an instinctive wariness of urban places. Generations of accumulated wisdom had taught them that "going to town" meant "getting swindled" and "spending big money." For them, attending the local fair at the "market" constituted the most formal outing imaginable. As for the county seat or prefectural capital—those were places one simply never went unless absolutely necessary. Even after the Australians arrived and their son enlisted as a soldier, the elderly couple's range of activity remained confined to the area around their village. The "market" they frequented was nearby Ma'niao Town, which they considered quite bustling—a place that "had everything," rendering trips elsewhere unnecessary.

He glanced back at his parents. They surveyed their surroundings with visible trepidation, as though everything appeared simultaneously fragile and threatening. His mother was still chiding his father for dawdling and making them miss the public carriage. Salt Field Village wasn't far from Bairen Town, especially with the public carriage and city rail available; a round trip in a single day was perfectly relaxed. Yet he—a son who had traveled all across Liangguang—had inexplicably failed to bring his parents on such an outing for so many years. The realization stirred a wave of guilt in Tan Shuangxi's chest. He resolved to treat them well today.

Leaving the photo studio, the family strolled through Bairen Town, visiting the famous large shops. As noon approached, Tan Shuangxi planned to find a respectable restaurant where his parents could experience the pleasure of a proper meal. However, his choice of dining venue met with resolute resistance. Passing by Peony Tower, he had already stepped inside when his parents dragged him back out, muttering "It's so expensive—practically robbery!" as they hauled him away, leaving him rather embarrassed.

Next, they tried South Country, but his parents rejected that as well. His father requested a simple bowl of Lingao rice noodles from a roadside stall; his mother hoped to find a tea stall where she could rest her feet, claiming she had brought dry rations. Tan Shuangxi understood that his parents were partly unaccustomed to eating at restaurants and partly driven by an instinct to save money, but he refused firmly nonetheless.

"We've finally come out for a trip—we should eat something good," he urged. "Besides, I have money now. Plenty of it."

"You haven't even taken a wife yet! And when you retire and come home, won't you need to establish some property? Do you know how much prices have risen? Land has value but no buyers!"

"Yes, you're paid well now, but what about the future? Can you be a soldier and draw wages forever? You have to think ahead!"

Tan Shuangxi talked until his mouth went dry, yet he couldn't sway his parents. Instead, they scolded him for "not knowing how to live frugally." Amid this tug-of-war, the three of them found themselves at the entrance of an inconspicuous little eatery.

Posters were pasted by the door:

"Delicacies from the Fubo Army—the favorite of Army brothers!"

"The Army's strongest weapon is still the Ma'niao Burger!"

"50% discount for soldiers during the trial operation period!"

The three stood before the eatery, studying the signboard in confusion. What was a Ma'niao Burger? Tan Shuangxi knew that Ma'niao Fort was the formal name for the Army's Ma'niao Base—essentially just a place name.

The eatery's facade was simple in an "Australian style," unlike the ornate luxury of the cooperatives. Without the words on the signboard, one would never have guessed it was a restaurant.

Though he didn't understand what Ma'niao Burger meant in this context, he gathered that it sold cheap fast food with a "military style."

"How about we sample our unit's food? They're even offering half-price."

This argument easily swayed Tan Shuangxi's parents. The family walked inside.

The restaurant's layout resembled a military canteen. More than a dozen four-person tables stood in neat rows. There weren't many customers—half the tables sat empty—yet no waiter came to greet them. Just as they stood there bewildered, a voice called out from within: "Guests at the door—find a seat yourselves, then come here to order!"

Tan Shuangxi looked toward the voice. Behind a half-height counter inside the restaurant, a man who appeared to be the owner was waving at him. After settling his parents at a table, Tan Shuangxi approached the counter.

The owner wore an old uniform stripped of rank and branch insignia, with an apron printed with "Ma'niao Burger" tied over it. On his chest, uncovered by the apron, a red war wound ribbon was pinned. Clearly, this was a veteran.

"Sergeant Comrade, what would you like to eat? Our shop just opened!" The owner introduced the fare with animated enthusiasm. "Military-style food! Especially the Grassland Series..."

At the mention of "Grassland Series," Tan Shuangxi's stomach instinctively recoiled. *Wait—are they actually selling grassland dry rations?* For a moment, he regretted stepping inside.

Seeming to read his fellow soldier's thoughts, the owner quickly explained: "Everything we sell here is military-style, market products improved upon unit meals. Premium ingredients, superb flavor, suitable for all ages..."

As he spoke, he produced an illustrated menu for Tan Shuangxi to peruse. Though he recognized every character, Tan Shuangxi couldn't identify a single dish. After studying it for a moment, he simply laid several bills on the counter.

"There are three of us. This is the money—prepare whatever you think best."

This was his budget for today's proper meal. He would let this unknown comrade decide what to serve. Even if it wasn't delicious, he could consider it helping a retired fellow soldier.

"This is far too much!" The owner laughed, taking only one bill and pushing the rest back. "I'll have it ready for you shortly. Satisfaction guaranteed!" He handed over a number plate.

Returning to the table, Tan Shuangxi found his parents examining the morning's purchases one by one. His mother stroked the fabric of the new clothes lovingly while complaining about Tan Shuangxi spending money recklessly and blaming his father for choosing such a bright color. His father watched his wife's nagging with cheerful contentment, putting on and taking off the new straw hat.

The East Gate Market hadn't been particularly lively that morning. Only a handful of shops had opened, and most of the shop assistants had been lazy, showing little enthusiasm for sales. Nevertheless, Tan Shuangxi, holding filial piety close to his heart, had bought new clothes and fabric for his parents. Watching them demur with their words while honestly cherishing the items, he felt an unprecedented satisfaction. The joy of seeing his loved ones happy somewhat compensated for the regret of spending years in the army, unable to share in his parents' burdens.

"Customer Number 12, please come to the window to collect your meal." Following the owner's call, Tan Shuangxi rose and went to the counter. It seemed this shop didn't employ servers to bring dishes; customers had to retrieve their own orders when their number was called.

Tan Shuangxi arrived at the pickup window—a large glass partition with the kitchen visible inside. Dishes were transported from there to the pickup counter outside. Several plates now sat on a large tray, covered with oil paper lids to retain warmth. A rich aroma of spices and grease wafted out, causing Tan Shuangxi to swallow involuntarily.

The owner personally introduced the food: "Three Chicken Steak Ma'niao Burgers. Eat them while they're hot—they get a bit greasy when cold. Six braised chicken wings. This is the Grassland Nutritious Porridge. The blanched vegetables are complimentary—no charge. Come get more if it's not enough. There are also three bowls of Miso Soup; take these over first, then come back for them."

The small dining table was filled to the brim with food, creating a lavish spread. The fragrance made all three of them salivate, yet for a moment, none knew quite how to begin. Though chopsticks were provided, this thing—two thick buns sandwiching meat and vegetables—gave them pause. If it were a steamed bun or biscuit, they would simply pick it up and eat. But this was clearly not a steamed bun. And if they tried to lift it with chopsticks, something this large would almost certainly fall apart.

Feigning experience, Tan Shuangxi stole a glance at the surrounding customers. Seeing them all eating with their hands, he relaxed. Mimicking the others, he picked up a so-called Ma'niao Burger with the oil paper and introduced it to his parents: "Time is tight when the Fubo Army is marching and fighting. Often, we eat directly with our hands like this." So saying, he took a generous bite. Instantly, a rich, fatty fragrance flooded his mouth. The Ma'niao Burger was two toasted rice cakes sandwiching a chicken meat patty. The patty was crispy on the outside and tender within, juices bursting forth with each bite. Tiny explosions of flavor seemed to detonate across his tongue, releasing the taste wrapped in rich meat essence, sprinting from tongue tip to forehead. In an instant, his face grew slightly damp with perspiration, and fragrance lingered on his lips. The rice cakes, having absorbed the meat juices, provided a satisfying crispness. The light vegetable leaves didn't overwhelm the rich meat flavor but served instead as a delicate accent. Taking another large bite, Tan Shuangxi recalled that he had indeed eaten this before—only the components had been separate. Back then, he'd held a rice cake in one hand and a meat patty in the other, and his manner of eating had been rather unsightly.

His parents also picked up their burgers carefully and took tentative bites. Expressions of appreciation spread across their faces. Watching the change in their expressions, Tan Shuangxi's heart swelled with happiness. His mother ate two bites, then paused and asked: "Do you eat this well every day in your unit?"

Regarding his mother's innocent question, Tan Shuangxi felt a touch of pride. Of course, it was impossible to eat this well in the unit—most of the time it was simply about getting full. But wanting to show off, and also to keep his parents from worrying, he couldn't help exaggerating. "Not every day, but close enough. I can eat three of these in one meal." The moment the words left his mouth, he regretted them, because his parents stopped eating in unison. His mother handed over the Ma'niao Burger she had bitten twice and said softly: "I've had a taste—it is indeed quite delicious. You should have this one. I brought dry rations." As she spoke, she reached for her bundle.
