# Chapter 2840 Penny-Pinching

"Of course, organizing and coordinating this Mainland Cultural Strategy is also very important. I think perhaps Wen... Director Wen could do it. I see quite a few Senators have recommended him, and he's already responsible for Guangdong Greater Region—half the work would naturally fall on him anyway." Wang Luobin thought of his close comrade far away in the Two Guangs. According to rumors, he wasn't doing much proper work now. Give him this kind of work that straddled the practical and nominal—surely he'd be willing. What surprised Wang Luobin was that his proposal drew silence among the bigwigs. No one seconded his suggestion.

Qian Shuiting coughed, picked up his teacup and took a sip, cleared his throat, then responded: "Jeju Island and Kaohsiung within Hainan Greater Region are both important components of the Cultural Strategy. Let me state my position: for work within Hainan Greater Region, I'll arrange a dedicated person to coordinate. Their Propaganda sector doing this has some difficulties—managing both arts modernization and organizational coordination is asking too much of the propaganda Senators. I'm sure Director Wen would think and act the same. I have no doubt. However, having either greater region handle comprehensive organizational work isn't quite appropriate. This isn't just cross-regional—there's also cross-departmental. Best to find someone in Council of State to take charge. Everyone agree that makes sense?"

Wang Luobin hadn't been that interested in this matter to begin with. Qian Shuiting coming out to deflect was exactly what he wanted. He nodded at him and said: "You make a good point. If we're talking organizational coordination, Planning Commission has business relationships with all relevant units. How about troubling A-De?" With that, Wang Luobin turned his inquiring gaze to Wu De.

Wu De quickly waved his hands: "Last year's institutional reform moved the enterprises under several ministries to Planning Commission. These state enterprises' technical upgrade issues are already overwhelming. Really can't spare the bandwidth. Besides, I'm just an old Navy man who's never done cultural work. Better not have amateurs leading professionals."

Taking charge of this work had many benefits for future advancement—Wu De naturally understood. But the cultural circle had too many twists and turns. So Wu De was always quite cautious when dealing with Cultural Propaganda people.

"Unsolicited kindness comes from knaves or thieves." This time Dingding had tossed out an extremely tempting, benefit-laden olive branch, which always made Wu De feel there was some conspiracy here.

The State Secretary position he naturally desired. But he was a cautious person. Ma Qianzhu's State Secretary tenure would end in a few years. At that point, he'd be the strongest candidate for the position. No need to add another heavy brushstroke to his resume.

Wang Luobin felt somewhat deflated hearing this refusal. Among the "Ministers," there really weren't many with matching qualifications. He'd thought Wu De was quite suitable. Seeing everyone unwilling to take this work, was he supposed to do it himself? Or force it back to Dingding for self-reliance? Actually there was another suitable candidate: Ma Qianzhu, but Wang Luobin really didn't want the Superintendent managing this—because he already managed too much.

Just as he was hesitating, he suddenly heard a voice: "If truly no one else, I'll do it." Wang Luobin looked up—it was Ma Qianzhu. Trouble comes when you think about it.

Though not entirely pleased, Wang Luobin couldn't think of any other candidates.

"That's wonderful," Wang Luobin said with false enthusiasm, then asked with a cordial smile of concern: "Superintendent, you already have so much work. Can you manage?"

Ma Qianzhu returned an equally cordial smile: "Such important work—someone has to do it, right?" As he spoke, he habitually touched his forehead. Everyone immediately felt the reflection had intensified.

"I'm also at the point of too many lice to itch, too many debts to worry about. Besides, this role is mainly coordinating between departments—rather nominal, really. Won't add much workload. I as State Secretary am supposed to provide coordination services to all departments. It's professionally appropriate."

Ma Qianzhu's words left Wang Luobin speechless. From professional division of labor, he was indeed the right fit. From functional allocation, he was helping everyone clean up. Perfectly reasonable. Unless Wang Luobin personally jumped in with "Superintendent, you're working too hard—let me do it instead," there really wasn't any reasonable grounds for refusal.

"Then we'll trouble the Superintendent." In the end, Wang Luobin had to surrender to his own laziness.

For He Fanghui, the Senator Club was a new entertainment venue. Though he spent a month or two in Lingao each year, he habitually went to South Sea Coffee and Ziming House—not much interest in this "club" right under his nose.

"What a great place!" He Fanghui marveled for the twentieth time to Fang Fei. "Lingao is still the best. Sanya's so run-down there's nothing but ocean—and TM sharks at that." He viciously stubbed out his cigar in the ashtray.

"Great my ass!" Fang Fei couldn't understand the Senators' corgi-like behavior. Every single one already had several life secretaries, yet they still came out to stare at female servers' uniform skirts like they never wanted to leave. "You're practically an emperor in Sanya. Just exploit a few there—isn't that better than this?"

"This just shows you don't understand the suffering of us grassroots folks." On this topic, He Fanghui was suddenly wide awake. "You know how many women there are in Sanya? Besides the life secretaries I brought myself, there are hardly any decent-looking women. Plenty of female workers at the farms, but tanned so dark I'd believe you if you said they were from Rwanda. Only a pirate like Hu Wumei could go for that. Ambiance! Refinement! Bro, you've lost touch with the masses!"

"Then go to Ziming House when you come back! Why come here to harass servers?"

"Ziming House is too commercialized. Boring!" He Fanghui rubbed his gleaming bald head. "No fun!" He pulled the service bell cord.

"Another pitcher!" he said to the entering server, pointing at the punch bowl.

"Drink less." Fang Fei tried advising him, but his stomach churned and he hurried off to the restroom.

The club's restroom was top-tier among Senate facilities—luxurious, with 24-hour continuous cleaning. Cleanliness and comfort rivaled old-timeline office buildings. Inside were both squat and seated toilets to suit different Senator preferences.

Dingding chose the last stall, settled in comfortably to clear his bowels. Suddenly, clamor came from outside. Some Senator had drunk too much and was being helped to the restroom by several Senators to vomit.

After a round of violent retching, there were sounds of washing. The air filled with sour stench—clearly a terrible mess. Fang Fei privately grumbled. He was about to flush and go out when he suddenly caught the smell of cigar smoke. Amid the noise, Wu De's and Dingding's names appeared, immediately attracting Fang Fei's attention.

He could roughly distinguish the voices of main Senators. These few were unfamiliar—clearly not in important positions.

From their mocking words and colorful language, he gathered these were also Senators who'd come to the club for entertainment. Since they'd mentioned Dingding, he wanted to hear what ordinary Senators thought. So he held his breath and listened intently.

"...Chairman Wang has just over 2 years left before stepping down. Who the TM wants to take on new responsibilities at this point? If he weren't in the chairman position, would this thing be doable? Not doable! So might as well not do it—easy to mess things up..."

"I think Director Wen—no, Director Wen was originally going to take it, except he's in Guangdong and can't coordinate..."

"No, no. Old Wen is keeping distance right now."

"Anyway Director Wen has already been kicked off to the mainland."

"Why didn't A-De take this on? I heard he was originally quite interested. He's done civil affairs and economics for years now, and military is his original specialty so doesn't need work. Add some credentials, next term State Secretary, term after that Senate President or whatever—quite possible..."

"Why? You already said it yourself—his credentials are complete across the board. He's got everything. State Secretary will be his sooner or later. Why bother mixing with Dingding now?"

"Wouldn't he still want to boost popularity through Cultural Propaganda?"

"He doesn't need those popularity points anymore."

"Speaking of Qian Shuiting taking this on—that'd benefit him too. Why was he also looking constipated and pushing it away?"

"Outside Hainan Greater Region, he can't control anything. He can't even handle Jeju Island—not as influential as Dr. Zhong there."

"Not a single good person among the bananas..."

"Don't say it like that... Just because you're not a banana means you're good?... Hahaha..."

Just as Fang Fei was caught between laughter and tears, thinking these Soy Sauce Senators really had nothing nice to say, suddenly he heard his own name mentioned.

"Doesn't Dingding have several little brothers? Fang something... Fragrant Grass and Fei? Oh, Fang Fei! And the condom brand... Okamoto? These purely labor-intensive jobs—can't he just have his own people do them? Dingding sits back and rules—what's the meaning of giving it away?"

"Can't you see? If he doesn't yield some credit to the leadership, you think his crappy strategy would pass?"

"Damn, how come I didn't realize there's even TM interest exchange in this?"

"Not really. This bit of credit isn't necessarily worth the bigwigs' attention. Mainly he can't command anyone."

These weren't exactly novel insights. But listening now, Fang Fei felt indescribable mixed feelings. Besides Dingding and their own people, no one actually cared about the Cultural Infiltration Strategy. Everyone was calculating what the plan meant for the relevant parties' gains and losses, penny-pinching every benefit and impact.

Hearing this, his spirits suddenly deflated. He waited for the crowd outside to disperse, then left the restroom and went to the club's small garden. He lit a cigarette, watching the exhaled smoke rings slowly rise and disappear in the lamplight.
