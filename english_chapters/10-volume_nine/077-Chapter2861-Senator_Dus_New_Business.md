# Chapter 2861: Senator Du's New Business

Leaving Boss Mai's shop through the back door, Senator Du's expression became less lively. Several shops he had proposed to the Civil Affairs Placement Office were currently in trial operation. These business models copied from the old timeline's commercial system all showed some "acclimatization" issues in actual operation.

Take the Ma'niao Burger issue alone. On one hand, it was inspired by cheap burger shops in the old timeline; on the other hand, it was also due to seeing the popularity of Peony Tower. Since the old timeline had Pizza Hut, McDonald's, and KFC, yet still had room for Wallace [a Chinese fast-food chain], the new timeline's Ma'niao Burger should also have its space.

However, after these few days of actual operation, he realized he had thought too simply. Unlike Chinese fast food like boxed meals, this type of Western style relied extremely heavily on cheap factory food delivered by a cold chain system. If the shop owner had to make it themselves, the standardized taste and cost advantage would vanish.

The problem was that although the Commercial Department had established a rudimentary cold chain logistics system in Lingao and Guangzhou capable of small-scale delivery of refrigerated food locally, this system had nothing to do with "cheap."

In short, Ma'niao Burger's cost control was a failure. The owner only saw the cost of the meat patty, unaware that the cost of delivering the meat patty was also significant.

"It seems absolute copying won't work," Senator Du sighed to himself. The profit figures on the calculation table just now really dealt him a heavy blow. How to "reduce costs and increase efficiency" was a major topic for him now.

Helplessly, he wasn't a businessman by origin, nor had he run such small businesses. He was completely ignorant of the business logic within. It seemed this matter had to be discussed further with people from the Commercial Division and the Placement Office. But his time in Lingao was running out; he had to return to the mainland in the blink of an eye.

"Chief, returning to the County Seat?" The guard secretary waiting at the back door came up to greet him.

"To Bairen!"

After the time siren sounded twice, Tan Shuangxi brought his parents back to the photo studio. The long queue from the morning was gone. Only a few onlookers remained at the entrance of the photo studio.

Tan Shuangxi and his family entered the photo studio's main gate. The originally bustling front lobby was now empty; even the reception counter was unmanned.

Tan Shuangxi looked around and walked into a corridor following the sign "Go straight and turn right for photos." On the double swing doors of the first room on the right hung a sign "Please wait here for photos," and some noise came from inside. Tan Shuangxi walked on tiptoe to the door. Just as he was about to stick his head in to see what was happening, a stern shout came from behind, "Don't move! What are you doing?"

Turning around, inside the open door of the wing room on the left, two fully armed Fubo Army soldiers were watching him vigilantly, their right hands holding the handles of the revolvers strapped to their chests. Although dressed in Fubo Army uniforms, they had no rank insignia. The black collar patches with gold edges indicated they were guards from the Special Service Bureau. Tan Shuangxi recalled the regulations on capturing prisoners and hurriedly explained with a face full of smiles: "Don't misunderstand, I'm here to take photos. The lad at the photo studio told me to come in and find him at this time. My parents are outside too. Look, I just have a few clothes in this bag." As he spoke, he slowly put the bag in his hand on the ground and backed away.

A guard stepped forward to check Tan Shuangxi's bag and looked at his ID: "Comrade, just go in openly if you're taking photos. Why sneaking around? We thought you were silencing sentries."

Before Tan Shuangxi could respond, a burst of laughter came from the room. Old Zhang strolled out lazily, "Silencing sentries? Then his tactical level is too poor; I saw his shadow through the curtains."

Tan Shuangxi quickly explained: "The lad who gave out numbers this morning told me to come in at this time. I was afraid you were still resting... How could it be silencing sentries? Uncle, are you also a senior from the troops?"

Hearing someone mention his glorious history, Old Zhang's face immediately showed the pride of "back in the day when I started my unit." Then he began to introduce his glorious history endlessly: bayonet fighting in the Bopu Defense Battle, the scar on his arm left from bandit suppression in District 13, taking an arrow in the leg during the Shishan Blocking Action, breaking a few ribs during the Liberation of Chengmai, seizing the fort at Humen under Ming artillery fire. Chen Shixin, who came out behind him, had heard it no less than eight hundred times during his internship days here.

The Guangzhou Quartet were also "military enthusiasts," so after arriving in Lingao, he had visited the Fubo Army War History Museum and Public Library many times and knew the Fubo Army's war history like the back of his hand. Comparing it with what Old Zhang said, he knew he was bragging. He thought secretly, "Old soldier's mouth, water of the sea."

"Old Zhang! Why did you sneak out again?" A loud shout came from the inner room. Huang Yaomin walked out with large strides. "How many times have I said it? You have to watch over the photo developing!"

"This, this, I heard something abnormal outside, so I came out to check..." Old Zhang's bragging momentum vanished instantly. He could only respond with an awkward laugh.

"What fresh thing is worth you coming out to see?" Huang Yaomin frowned and scanned Tan Shuangxi. Seeing the comer was a soldier, his tone softened a bit, "Hurry back to work!"

"Yes!" Old Zhang immediately stood at attention, adding, "Um, Company Commander Qiu opened the plate box again just now..."

Company Commander Qiu was Huang Yaomin's eldest apprentice. He was hardworking and willing, but rather dull.

Huang Yaomin sighed helplessly and said: "Put your heart into it and teach him properly! A batch of newcomers will arrive tomorrow. You have to seize the time to train them to master the photo studio's business. Divide the work: reception, mixing chemicals, taking photos, developing... Separate them all, and rotate posts after a while..."

"Chief, this task is a bit tight. I haven't even fully mastered it myself..." Old Zhang was a bit daunted.

"Seize the time. When the Guangzhou Great World Photo Studio opens depends on your speed in training them. Don't you want to be a General Manager? My Great Shopkeeper..."

"Many thanks for the Chief's cultivation... I guarantee to complete the mission..."

"It's not a big deal. This craft will be eliminated in another year or two anyway. Wet plate cameras are too troublesome; they will be replaced by dry plates sooner or later. Hand over this craft early and switch to other positions; it will be greatly beneficial to you personally..."

"Chief, what is a dry plate?" Chen Shixin interjected and asked.

"The next generation of photography technology." Huang Yaomin didn't say much to avoid spilling the beans. "Is this the number you added this morning?"

"Yes!"

"Since you promised them, finish it. Don't keep people waiting long." Huang Yaomin said and added, "You come with me first; I have a few words to say."

Only then did Chen Shixin see Tan Shuangxi. He smiled somewhat awkwardly and forcedly, "Sorry, I was busy developing photos just now. I'll arrange it for you right away!"

"No rush, no rush. We can wait a while, no problem." Tan Shuangxi waved his hands hurriedly. *Goodness, there's a Chief here!*

Tan Shuangxi's family sat on the bench in the corridor to rest—originally, hearing there was a Senator in the room next door, his parents didn't dare to sit and insisted on standing. Tan Shuangxi had convinced them to sit down with great difficulty. seeing the two old people sitting stiffly, backs straight as boards, not even daring to breathe loudly, he couldn't help smiling helplessly.

Sitting in the corridor, intermittent dialogue drifted out from the room:

"...I don't know about this either. Anyway, it's more convenient and simple than now. I dare say to you, in less than ten years, cameras will become things ordinary families can afford. Taking photos will become a very common thing. The photography trade has a great future... Hahaha... What do you think about the matter I mentioned last time?"

"My personal interest is still in art. Although taking photos is similar, but... I'll obey the organization's arrangement."

"Organizational arrangement also considers personal aspirations; don't have misgivings. Since it's like this, I respect your idea. When you return to Guangzhou, I'll arrange some photography-related work for you. You can shoulder it all, how about that?"

"Many thanks for the Chief's cultivation... I guarantee to complete the mission..."

"I'm not an art guy, but I have a reminder for you. Don't go down the path of painting as realistically as possible anymore. As soon as photography technology comes out, that path is dead. You do this yourself; you should have the experience... In my opinion, art should express those impressions that don't exist in reality, or exist in reality but are too late to capture with photography... I'm not an art guy; you just feel it yourself..."

Just as Tan Shuangxi was listening intently, a Senator walked out of the room quickly. Tan Shuangxi was startled: *What's wrong with this photo studio? Two Senators at once!* Looking closer, he had seen him before: wasn't this Senator Du? He had seen him from afar at the collective wedding in Guangzhou back then.

He quickly jumped up to salute. The other party glanced at the Second Lieutenant saluting him, nodded in return, and walked out of the photo studio with large strides. Chen Shixin, following behind, smiled at Tan Shuangxi, followed closely to send the Chief and guards onto the carriage, and then returned.

Du Yibin drank a full glass of iced Kvass on the carriage, finally suppressing his excitement. He had talked with Huang Yaomin for over an hour just now. He told him his ideas. The other party was also very supportive. How could he have forgotten this project at the beginning! Judging from the market reaction in Lingao, the acceptance among naturalized citizens and wealthy people was very high. It showed that whether it was accepted or not mainly depended on economic ability. The market in Guangzhou might not be smaller than Lingao; after all, there were more local tyrants in Guangzhou. The key was that the ID system would be rolled out comprehensively next. Taking photos was a rigid demand under administrative enforcement; whoever opened a shop would make money.

At this moment, Senator Du had already planned it out in his head. First, reverse a shop at Guangzhou Great World to open a flagship store. The flagship store would specialize in high-end photography products, large sizes, and luxury sets. Use bidding to attract private capital to run it. Once the reputation was established, sink into the market and open a batch of small photo studios to place moderately disabled veterans with physical defects.
