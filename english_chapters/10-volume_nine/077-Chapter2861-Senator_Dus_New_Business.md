# Chapter 2861: Senator Du's New Business

As Senator Du slipped out through the back door of Boss Mai's shop, the animation faded from his face. Several establishments he had proposed to the Civil Affairs Placement Office were currently in trial operation, and every business model he had copied from the old timeline's commercial system was showing signs of "acclimatization" in practice.

Take the Ma'niao Burger situation alone. On one hand, the concept drew inspiration from cheap burger joints in the old timeline; on the other, he had been encouraged by the popularity of Peony Tower. Since the old timeline had Pizza Hut, McDonald's, and KFC, yet still left room for Wallace, surely the new timeline's Ma'niao Burger should find its niche as well.

But after these few days of actual operation, he realized his thinking had been too simplistic. Unlike Chinese fast food such as boxed meals, this Western-style model depended heavily on cheap factory-produced food delivered through a cold chain system. If the shop owner had to prepare everything themselves, both the standardized taste and cost advantage would evaporate.

The problem was that although the Commercial Department had established a rudimentary cold chain logistics system in Lingao and Guangzhou—one capable of small-scale refrigerated food delivery within those localities—this system had nothing to do with "cheap."

In short, Ma'niao Burger's cost control was a failure. The owner had only seen the cost of the meat patty, oblivious to the significant expense of delivering it.

"It seems absolute copying won't work," Senator Du sighed to himself. The profit figures on the calculation table had dealt him a heavy blow. How to "reduce costs and increase efficiency" had become the pressing question before him now.

Unfortunately, he had never been a businessman by trade, nor had he ever run such small enterprises. The business logic underlying them remained utterly foreign to him. This matter would have to be discussed further with people from the Commercial Division and the Placement Office. But his time in Lingao was running short; he would have to return to the mainland in the blink of an eye.

"Chief, returning to the County Seat?" The guard secretary waiting at the back door stepped forward to greet him.

"To Bairen!"

After the time siren sounded twice, Tan Shuangxi brought his parents back to the photo studio. The long queue from that morning had vanished. Only a handful of onlookers lingered near the entrance.

Tan Shuangxi and his family passed through the main gate. The front lobby, so bustling earlier, now stood empty; even the reception counter was unmanned.

Tan Shuangxi glanced around, then followed a sign reading "Go straight and turn right for photos" down a corridor. On the double swing doors of the first room to the right hung another sign: "Please wait here for photos." Muffled sounds emanated from within. Tan Shuangxi crept toward the door on tiptoe. Just as he was about to peek inside, a stern voice barked from behind: "Don't move! What are you doing?"

He spun around. Through the open door of a wing room on the left, two fully armed Fubo Army soldiers watched him with vigilant eyes, their right hands resting on the grips of the revolvers strapped to their chests. Though dressed in Fubo Army uniforms, they bore no rank insignia. The black collar patches with gold trim marked them as guards from the Special Service Bureau. Tan Shuangxi recalled the regulations on capturing prisoners and hastily explained, forcing a smile: "Don't misunderstand—I'm here to take photos. The young fellow at the studio told me to come find him at this hour. My parents are outside too. Look, I've only got a few clothes in this bag." As he spoke, he slowly set the bag on the ground and stepped back.

One guard came forward to inspect the bag and examine his identification. "Comrade, if you're here to take photos, just walk in openly. Why all the sneaking around? We thought you were silencing sentries."

Before Tan Shuangxi could respond, laughter erupted from the room. Old Zhang ambled out at a leisurely pace. "Silencing sentries? His tactical level would be terrible then—I spotted his shadow through the curtains."

Tan Shuangxi quickly explained: "The young fellow handing out numbers this morning told me to come at this time. I was worried you might still be resting..." He paused. "How could it be silencing sentries? Uncle, are you also a veteran from the troops?"

At any mention of his glorious history, Old Zhang's face immediately lit up with the pride of "back in the day when I started my unit." And so he launched into an endless recounting of his exploits: bayonet fighting in the Bopu Defense Battle, the scar on his arm from bandit suppression in District 13, taking an arrow in the leg during the Shishan Blocking Action, breaking a few ribs in the Liberation of Chengmai, seizing the fort at Humen under Ming artillery fire. Chen Shixin, emerging behind him, had heard these tales no fewer than eight hundred times during his internship days here.

The Guangzhou Quartet were also military enthusiasts, so after arriving in Lingao, Chen Shixin had visited the Fubo Army War History Museum and Public Library many times. He knew the Fubo Army's war history like the back of his hand. Comparing it to what Old Zhang claimed, he recognized the bragging for what it was. *Old soldier's mouth, deep as the sea,* he thought privately.

"Old Zhang! Why did you sneak out again?" A loud shout echoed from the inner room. Huang Yaomin strode out with purpose. "How many times have I told you? You have to watch over the photo developing!"

"This—well, I heard something abnormal outside, so I came out to check..." Old Zhang's bravado evaporated instantly. He could only respond with an awkward laugh.

"What fresh sight is worth you coming out to see?" Huang Yaomin frowned and scanned Tan Shuangxi. Seeing the newcomer was a soldier, his tone softened somewhat. "Hurry back to work!"

"Yes!" Old Zhang snapped to attention, then added, "Um, Company Commander Qiu opened the plate box again just now..."

Company Commander Qiu was Huang Yaomin's eldest apprentice. Hardworking and willing, but rather dull.

Huang Yaomin sighed with helpless resignation. "Put your heart into it and teach him properly! A batch of newcomers arrives tomorrow. You need to seize the time and train them to master the photo studio's operations. Divide the work: reception, mixing chemicals, taking photos, developing... Separate it all, then rotate posts after a while..."

"Chief, this task is a bit tight. I haven't even fully mastered it myself..." Old Zhang sounded daunted.

"Seize the time. When the Guangzhou Great World Photo Studio opens depends on how quickly you train them. Don't you want to be a General Manager? My Great Shopkeeper..."

"Many thanks for the Chief's cultivation... I guarantee I'll complete the mission..."

"It's not that significant. This craft will be obsolete in another year or two anyway. Wet plate cameras are too troublesome; dry plates will replace them sooner or later. Hand over this craft early and transition to other positions—it'll benefit you greatly in the long run..."

"Chief, what is a dry plate?" Chen Shixin interjected.

"The next generation of photography technology." Huang Yaomin said no more, careful not to reveal too much. "Is this the appointment you added this morning?"

"Yes!"

"Since you promised them, see it through. Don't keep people waiting." Huang Yaomin paused, then added, "Come with me first; I have a few words to say."

Only then did Chen Shixin notice Tan Shuangxi. He smiled somewhat awkwardly. "Sorry, I was busy developing photos just now. I'll arrange everything for you right away!"

"No rush, no rush. We can wait a while—no problem." Tan Shuangxi waved his hands hastily. *Goodness, there's a Chief here!*

Tan Shuangxi's family settled onto the bench in the corridor to rest—or tried to. Upon hearing there was a Senator in the room next door, his parents refused to sit and insisted on standing. It had taken considerable effort for Tan Shuangxi to convince them otherwise. Watching the two elderly people sit stiffly, backs straight as boards, not even daring to breathe loudly, he could only smile with helpless affection.

Sitting in the corridor, fragments of dialogue drifted out from the room:

"...I don't know the specifics either. But it'll be more convenient and simpler than what we have now. I'll tell you this much: in less than ten years, cameras will become affordable for ordinary families. Taking photos will become commonplace. The photography trade has a tremendous future ahead... Hahaha... What do you think about the matter I mentioned last time?"

"My personal interest still lies in art. Although taking photos is similar, but... I'll defer to the organization's arrangement."

"Organizational arrangements also consider personal aspirations—don't hold back. Since that's how you feel, I respect your preference. When you return to Guangzhou, I'll arrange some photography-related work for you. You can take charge of all of it. How does that sound?"

"Many thanks for the Chief's cultivation... I guarantee I'll complete the mission..."

"I'm no art connoisseur, but I have a word of advice for you. Don't continue down the path of painting as realistically as possible. Once photography technology emerges, that road is a dead end. You do this yourself; you should understand from experience... In my view, art should express those impressions that don't exist in reality, or that exist but are too fleeting for photography to capture... I'm no art connoisseur—just something for you to consider..."

Just as Tan Shuangxi was listening intently, a Senator emerged from the room at a brisk pace. Tan Shuangxi started in surprise. *What's going on with this photo studio? Two Senators at once!* Looking more closely, the face was familiar—wasn't this Senator Du? He had seen him from afar at the collective wedding in Guangzhou.

He sprang to his feet and saluted. The Senator glanced at the Second Lieutenant saluting him, nodded in acknowledgment, and strode out of the photo studio. Chen Shixin, following close behind, flashed Tan Shuangxi a quick smile before hurrying to escort the Chief and his guards to their carriage, then returned.

Du Yibin drained a full glass of iced kvass in the carriage, finally tempering his excitement. He had spoken with Huang Yaomin for over an hour just now, laying out his ideas, and the other man had been thoroughly supportive. How could he have overlooked this project at the start? Judging from the market response in Lingao, acceptance among naturalized citizens and the wealthy was remarkably high. Whether something was accepted or not came down primarily to economic capability. The market in Guangzhou might prove no smaller than Lingao's—after all, Guangzhou had more local magnates. The crucial factor was that the ID system would soon be rolled out comprehensively. Taking photos would become mandatory under administrative enforcement; whoever opened a shop would make money.

By now, Senator Du had already mapped it out in his head. First, secure a storefront at Guangzhou Great World to establish a flagship location. The flagship store would specialize in high-end photography products, large formats, and luxury portrait packages. Use bidding to attract private capital to operate it. Once the reputation was established, sink into the broader market and open a network of smaller photo studios—perfect placements for moderately disabled veterans with physical impairments.
