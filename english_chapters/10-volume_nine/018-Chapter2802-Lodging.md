# Chapter 2802 Lodging

Suppressed with a bellyful of anger, Tan Shuangxi took out the receipt form: "Please trouble you to stamp a fingerprint on this."

The Fang girl stamped her fingerprint while sobbing and sniffing, asking in a tearful voice, "When he left, were you taking care of him?"

"Yes, we took care of him as much as possible by his side, did everything we could."

"Weren't you afraid of being infected?" the old man said coldly.

Tan Shuangxi softened his tone and said, "Sir, you haven't served in the Fubo Army. In the troops, men are like brothers to each other. It has to be this way so we can survive on the battlefield and complete our missions. There, even strangers quickly become good friends." Tan Shuangxi spoke impassionedly, thinking to himself that this point really wasn't a lie. Although Hu Weide was annoying, once on the battlefield, everyone's relationship became tighter than ever before—it was just that an accident happened not long after.

Hu Weide's wife said, "You are too good. I know Ah Wei has an unlikable personality and never gets along well with others..."

Indeed, liking to show off and talk big was only the mildest of his faults; being self-righteous was the problem that made him difficult for almost everyone to get along with. Hu Weide's own death was half due to this. It was originally a small wound; he refused the medic's bandage and insisted on following the country method of scattering a handful of dry soil to stop the bleeding. As a result, he got tetanus, suffered in the company for three or four days, and couldn't be saved even after being sent to the rear hospital.

Even trained medical soldiers were unwilling to look after Hu Weide because he was like a person possessed by an evil ghost. After the onset of the disease, Hu Weide's whole body was tense. At the slightest sound, even the wind blowing through leaves or sunlight shining through the gaps in leaves onto his face, his already tense muscles would convulse again. His body arched like a fish on a frying pan, his arms raised vertically in the air, his face distorted by convulsions, his mouth emitting hissing low roars. Tetanus bacillus infection causes total body muscle tension and spasms; when the respiratory muscles spasm, the patient loses respiratory function and dies—so the medic who sent him to the medical team told everyone upon returning. Everyone had heard of tetanus during first aid training, but *Clostridium tetani* and the horrifying appearance after infection were blind spots for everyone. Even the medic couldn't explain the whys and wherefores, only repeating a few sentences heard from the Senator doctors: wounds must be washed and disinfected; if one gets tetanus, there's no hope even if sent to Lingao. Therefore, how Hu Weide died in the end, when he died, and what happened before his death—what Tan Shuangxi knew was actually just the content on that death notification. The so-called "taking care of him by his side" was just a comforting lie.

"Thank... you..."

The Fang girl murmured these words, staring blankly at the floor, repeating over and over in her mouth: "...You still loved me... it's all my fault... I shouldn't have let you enlist even if you beat me to death..."

Tan Shuangxi was led out of Hu Weide's house by Chen Linhuang like a sleepwalker. He sat under a big tree by the threshing ground for a while before feeling he had come back to his senses.

Chen Linhuang said somewhat apologetically, "Sorry, comrade. Father Fang is just that kind of person! He originally looked down on Ah Wei and only reluctantly agreed because his daughter insisted."

"With that mean and harsh manner, I can't imagine what it feels like to work for this kind of person." Zhang Laicai looked at Chen Linhuang with sympathetic eyes.

Chen Linhuang laughed: "His words are ugly, but the money he pays is plenty. Let him say what he wants; I won't lose a piece of meat."

"With his attitude, he pays more?!"

"The wages Father Fang pays are the highest in this area, the same market rate as the state-owned farms," Chen Linhuang said. "Otherwise, would everyone be willing to work so hard for him?"

Tan Shuangxi stopped talking. He looked wistfully at this threshing ground. The sun was setting, illuminating the fields and houses in gold. But in this beautiful scenery, there would never be Hu Weide again. In a few more years, only the Fang girl, who had shared marital affection with him, would still remember him, right?

He suddenly remembered something and turned back. A moment later, he came out again. Zhang Laicai was a bit surprised: "What did you go back in for?"

"I wanted to ask the Fang girl where in Fujian Ah Wei was from. If there's a chance to go to Fujian, we can look for his family."

"Any news?"

"No," Tan Shuangxi spread his hands and shook his head helplessly. "The Fang girl only knows he was probably from around Zhangzhou or Quanzhou in Southern Fujian. Ah Wei never said exactly where."

"Forget it, let's go." Zhang Laicai lost interest. "Hurry up, or we'll be walking in the dark."

"If worse comes to worst, we'll ask for lodging at the village office," Tan Shuangxi said.

The two set off quickly, walking back along the country path. Not long after, Chen Linhuang caught up and stopped them, giving each a lotus leaf packet. Judging by the oil stains seeping through, it was likely cooked food.

"The Fang girl asked me to bring two portions of glutinous rice chicken for you. This is a treat we laborers eat. It's coarse food; fill your bellies on the road."

"Having food is good enough; this is too polite." Indeed, they were somewhat hungry.

"The Fang girl can't make many decisions; Father Fang has the final say in the house," Chen Linhuang explained. "Don't disdain it."

Chen Linhuang left in a hurry. Tan Shuangxi and Zhang Laicai exchanged a rather complicated look and left silently with the items.

By the time they returned to the village office, the sun was setting in the west. The two asked for lodging at the village office. Fortunately, when the village office was built, the issue of overnight stays for personnel on official duty had been considered, and there were three dormitories. The village head also invited them to have dinner.

After dinner, the village head had someone set up a small table under the big tree at the threshing ground in front of the village office, inviting them to drink tea and chat. A few "prominent figures" of the village also came. The Mainland Campaign had started two years ago; although the village could see newspapers and bulletins, news was still relatively blocked. With two battlefield witnesses arriving, naturally, they wanted to have a good chat.

The village head poured a cup of tea for everyone. The teapot and teacups were obviously Australian style, and even the hot water was stored in a thermos bottle, almost exactly the same as the reception room at battalion headquarters. Drinking tea was actually a pastime that had become popular in recent years. In the past, only wealthy people with some culture could afford such "elegant matters." Now, a large bag of crude tea could be bought for a few cents. In these times, a few cents was no longer an amount that had to be scrimped and saved.

"...Now we have living banks," the village head said. "Selling eggs for a few days is enough to buy tea. Not just tea, but buying salt and other odds and ends also counts on scraping it out of chicken butts!"

Running a courtyard economy was a major focus, specifically promoting chicken raising. Eggs had now become an important income source for farmers.

As for where the eggs went, it was the "Egg Factory" recently opened by the Heaven and Earth Society, which was actually a food factory specialized in processing eggs. Acquired eggs were processed into "egg powder," "salted yolks," and "flying whites" (egg whites). They also frequently appeared on the Fubo Army's dining tables as military rations.

The group drank tea and talked about idle matters, especially the war in Liangguang; everyone wanted to hear about it. The two naturally lived up to expectations, embellishing their experiences along the way. With their narration, the listeners seemed to be personally on the scene of this campaign, sometimes excited, sometimes wringing their hands, sometimes sighing endlessly...

After dinner, the number of children on the threshing ground increased, laughing and playing together. A few slightly older children gathered together, seeming to discuss something. Each held a wooden stick with a paper flag pasted on top. Intermittent arguments could be heard from afar: "I'm not being it today... You be it first... Then I'll be it... No cheating..."

Soon, the children divided into two camps, standing on either side of the threshing ground. Were they playing Cops and Robbers? This was a compulsory course for children growing up in villages in this area.

The group of children playing "bandits" was similar to Tan Shuangxi's era, taking some tree branches as weapons. A few naughty children took brooms from home as big swords; most likely, they would get beaten again when they got home later. Among the children playing "government troops," someone shouted "Form ranks," and a group of children of varying ages actually formed a double-row line of battle. The shorter children were in the front row, the taller ones in the back, all shouldering their sticks on their right shoulders. Inside the formation, another child shouted loudly "Load," and the children in the line took down their sticks and stood them on the ground, pretending to feel in their pockets to perform the loading action, then raised their sticks in a shooting preparation posture.

"Oho, they learned pretty well!" Tan Shuangxi couldn't help but praise; this drill level caught up with new recruits.

The next command came: "Return sights to zero." Tan Shuangxi beamed with joy. Who taught this? Too professional.

The other group of children started trotting over. Although they had no formation, each was full of momentum, shouting heaven-shaking cries: "Kill the Baldies," "Capture Ma the Pig-dragger alive"...

From the line of battle came a burst of mouth-simulated gunfire sounds. Individual children even acted out recoil and muzzle climb. The children opposite screamed miserably and fell to the ground one after another. A few children, whether due to slow reaction or script requirements, continued to run forward waving their weapons.

Another command came from the line of battle: "Fix bayonets, charge!" Then the two groups of children crashed together. Soon the game ended amidst the crying of children from who knows which side. Several peasant women picked up their mud-covered children from the crowd and went home for the second half of the Political Security Bureau-themed session.

Tan Shuangxi and Zhang Laicai awkwardly wiped the tea water and tea leaves from their chins and clothes. That cry of "Kill the Baldies" from the children just now had really made the two spray their tea. The village head explained with slight embarrassment that the game was taught by the village's stationed police officer, a veteran who had participated in the Chengmai Campaign. Even the children's Minié rifles, those sticks, were found by the stationed police officer to resemble the shape. And those lines suspected of rebellion were taught by Chief Wan of the Heaven and Earth Society; naturalized citizens wouldn't dare joke about this even if beaten to death.
