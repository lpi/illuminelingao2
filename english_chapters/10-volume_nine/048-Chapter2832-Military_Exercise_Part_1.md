# Chapter 2832 Military Exercise (Part 1)

"Comrade, the new shells you're describing—what's the significance of making them?" Sun Shangxiang spoke up again: "A certain Senator once recited two lines of poetry: 'If we can repel invaders, why need excessive slaughter?' What's your view on this?"

"Does Comrade Reporter really think slaughtering those life-treasuring Ming officers and beggar-like soldiers justifies developing forged steel HE shells?" Qi Kelong stiffened her neck again: "You've got it wrong. They don't deserve it at all. These good things are for entertaining Manchurian Tartars in the future."

Their subsequent conversation—Mai Ruibao couldn't recall it now. Ming, Manchurian Tartars, military threat—these words jumped into his brain and kept spinning around. Ruibao set down his chopsticks. Inadvertently touching the camera he never let leave his side, that feeling grew even stronger: something big was about to happen, and he, even his entire family, would inevitably be swept up in it.

Director Dingding often had a catchphrase on his lips: "Good news is run out." Mai Ruibao didn't know if the interview photos he'd taken this time counted as good photo journalism, but in terms of running—this Danzhou trip had certainly involved plenty. Though called a "zone," Danzhou Industrial Zone actually covered nearly a third of the entire county. Though construction was only preliminary, the various enterprises and supporting facilities already in operation were truly eye-opening. However, the subsequent tours of Danzhou Building Materials Factory, Cement Factory, Seafood Processing Factory, and other enterprises—even though Mayor Liu Yixiao talked up his "local industrial construction achievements" to the skies, the inspection team clearly had little interest in these small factories common everywhere in Lingao. Even Mai Ruibao realized they were basically supporting facilities serving Danzhou Industrial Zone. The Senators were rather more interested in the National Army Training Center that Lü Zeyang was building at Eman Market.

South China's largest National Army training center was currently located on Hong Kong Island. But Hong Kong Island was ultimately too small. As institutions and facilities there increased, it was becoming somewhat constrained. The training center was planning to relocate to Lantau Island.

The Lantau training camp handled National Army induction training—mainly reorganizing and reforming various old-style armed forces that had submitted to the Senate. In a sense, political training exceeded military training. But Lü Zeyang had struck out on a different path, establishing a "National Army Instructor Corps" in Danzhou for "advanced tactical training." The main purpose was training officers and NCOs for the National Army, while also handling training of certain special units within the National Army.

The site Lü Zeyang had selected was near Danzhou's northern coast—lacking rivers and streams. Apart from scattered salt-making villages by the sea, it was sparsely populated, with no need to worry about trampling farmland. Mai Ruibao observed the brand-new barracks, fences, and training equipment—their wooden parts hadn't even been painted yet. Numerous National Army recruits and foreign soldiers from all corners of the world, speaking in various strange accents, shouted the New Speech commands completely off-key, their formations looking crooked. Several military Senators watching their awkward drilling actually nodded approvingly while exchanging comments, busily pulling Senator Lü Zeyang aside to ask all sorts of questions.

Mai Ruibao used a wooden stick he'd picked up in the industrial park to make a simple tripod, attempting to mount his camera to capture the Senators' heroic figures. A string of giggles made his hands slow down—strange. Since finishing yesterday's factory tour, Miss Sun had been constantly complaining under her breath about too much walking and uncomfortable feet. This morning, she'd had an even sourer expression. Why was she now smiling again? Mai Ruibao followed her gaze toward a corner of the drill ground where a squad of recruits was doing the most basic formation training. Apparently unable to understand the New Speech commands, every time the order to turn was given, a few unlucky souls would slam face-to-face into each other, making the instructor curse a blue streak, periodically dragging out some poor soul and delivering a flurry of blows with his military cane. The instructor's Cantonese native build was already quite slight, but the recruits before him were nearly a head shorter still. The National Army uniforms on them looked like yellow sacks. These were just a bunch of kids—no wait, looking at their dark skin, they were practically a group of little monkeys.

"These are all Annamese?" A familiar voice came from nearby. Chairman Wang wore a white pith helmet, hands clasped behind his back. "How many in total?"

"Vice Minister Zhou brought them. About 500 altogether." Lü Zeyang also wore the same style of helmet, brim pressed low, shadows hiding his expression: "I hear the Vice Minister has practically become regent over at the Nguyễn's. God knows how many men he extorted from Lord Nguyễn. He even plans to set up some armed security force for the Nanyang Company. I talked to him once, told him since South Vietnam colony is still Senate territory, defense must rely on Fubo Army and National Army. Only then did he hand over these five hundred-odd—definitely still holding some back. According to the Vice Minister, they're all military household children of the Nguyễn dynasty. Tsk tsk—looks like if I don't train them into crack troops, I'll be letting down the Vice Minister and the Senate!"

"I think it's quite good. Train them well—Annam monkeys can become excellent light infantry." Chairman Wang nodded slightly: "This is actually blood tax. Discuss this in a meeting later—best to institutionalize it. All Senate colonies and overseas territories can adopt this."

After a hasty lunch in the training center's simple but clean canteen, the inspection team hurried to nearby Eman Ridge to observe a field exercise. Eman Ridge was only 208 meters in elevation, but it was an important commanding height on Hainan's west coast. Fubo Army had carved a mountain path and established an observation post on the ridge. Unexpectedly, this was when Miss Sun hit her limit. She half-leaned against a boulder, unable to take another step. Her small face was flushed crimson, eyes brimming with tears—truly unable to go on.

"Young reporter comrade, please escort your female colleague back to rest." Chairman Wang told Mai Ruibao, then added with a half-joking tone: "Do seize this opportunity."

The Chairman's instruction had the complete opposite effect on Mai Ruibao. He rushed Sun Shangxiang back to the guesthouse in the town center, then flew back by carriage—Senators observing a live military exercise was major news. Absolutely must seize the interview opportunity. He had to abandon his improvised tripod.

Reporter Mai held his breath, lugging his heavy camera and film pack, sprinting up the mountaintop. Before his eyes appeared the volcanic eruption millions of years ago, leaving terraced plateaus and rocky beaches along the coastline. The black boulder beaches were fragmented by clusters of dense silver grass and yellow flower hibiscus, appearing and disappearing in the musket smoke. The exercise had been underway for quite some time. Between gasps, he could still hear the Senators chattering: "Where'd Red side get so many people?"

"The extra ones are village militia from the joint defense. See—they're all carrying standard spears."

"What's the point of bringing this crowd to pad numbers?" Old Di muttered, binoculars raised. "Hey, White side is fighting pretty well."

On the hilltop, Senators held binoculars and watched intently. Though this was only a battalion-level exercise, it was a test of whether the advanced tactical training curriculum that newly appointed National Army Commander Lü Zeyang was implementing was effective.

The National Army had always been positioned as "second-tier forces"—at one point even becoming a dumping ground for Fubo Army personnel being punished. Lü Zeyang believed this practice seriously affected unit combat effectiveness. Costwise, a National Army soldier's equipment and maintenance costs, though lower than Fubo Army, still reached over sixty percent. Their potential should be fully realized. So upon taking office, he'd begun improving training.

White side: National Army soldiers wearing white pith helmets with white towels wrapped around their arms as identification, had deployed a thin, winding formation at the combat front. As Fangcaodi students also underwent military training, Mai Ruibao gradually recognized that this irregular line was actually pairs alternating fire—quite methodical. Red side's commander tried to leverage his numerical advantage, ordering the militia to charge frontally while a National Army company attempted to flank White side. His plan quickly ran into problems: the continuous skirmisher fire intimidated the inexperienced militia. Their charge became hesitant and faltering. The already disorderly militia bunched together in confusion, wavering and unable to advance. The flanking company was stopped by White side's reserve, which quickly deployed in line and delivered two fierce volleys that inflicted "heavy casualties." Finally, bayonets chased them back.

"Good—solid and steady." Chairman Wang praised. Having eliminated the flank threat, White side didn't rashly pursue. Still in skirmish line, covering each other's fire, they steadily advanced step by step toward Red side's position. The militia facing them had nothing but bamboo spears and standard spears. Helpless to retaliate under fire, panic spread. First two or three slipped away, dropping their weapons. Fear was contagious. Facing the approaching muzzles and rolling smoke, more and more militia turned and fled. Red side's National Army soldiers behind them tried desperately to stop them but to no avail—in moments, they'd scattered completely.

Xi Yazhou suddenly lowered his binoculars: "What have I always said? If auxiliary troops are low-quality and poorly commanded, they're just a liability in combat."

"Not too bad—at least these militia didn't run directly backward. That would have dragged the National Army along with them." Fu Sansi observed: "Militia can only be used for fortified positions. Whose bright idea was it to bring them out for field battle?"

The two went back and forth, drawing all of Mai Ruibao's attention. Suddenly, he noticed Mayor Liu Yixiao standing nearby had an ugly expression on his face.

After losing militia support, Red side's National Army also formed in line, countering with fierce volley fire. White smoke clouds rolled everywhere, nearly obscuring the black stone beach and brush between the two forces. Xi Yazhou watched, shaking his head continuously: "Red side's tactics are very disadvantageous in firepower competition. In real combat, they'd already be suffering heavy casualties—one charge would finish them."
