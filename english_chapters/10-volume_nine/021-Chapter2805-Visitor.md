# Chapter 2805 Visitor

Both were startled again. The woman signaled him not to speak and got up to go to the bedroom herself. Not long after, she returned with a flustered expression, whispering: "You just stay in this room, don't make a sound!"

The man's face turned somewhat pale; he knew the woman was a very bold person. Whatever could scare her was obviously not an ordinary matter.

"Who is it?!" he asked nervously.

"None of your business." The woman exhorted, "Just stay here and don't make a sound."

Watching the woman's hurried figure going downstairs, the man became even more uneasy. He heard the sound of the main door opening in the main hall downstairs and voices speaking.

Judging by the voices, several men had come. The man tensed up. He quietly crept to the door of the room. From here, he could glimpse the scene in the main hall downstairs.

The visitors were three men: a middle-aged man in plain clothes, followed by two soldiers in uniform.

The man's face turned white. He didn't know what these people did, but such a combination of personnel looked exactly like they were here to catch someone sabotaging a military marriage. If they knew about his affair here from last night to today, being beaten half to death would probably be the best outcome; going to jail was certain.

The man's mind went blank instantly, his heart filled only with regret. What medicine did he take wrong to hook up with her! Not living his good days properly, but insisting on coming to this floating place...

However, he quickly calmed himself down, his mind recalling rapidly: this didn't count as "caught in bed," and there were no "items that shouldn't be there" left in the bedroom. As long as the woman didn't sell him out, even if questioned, as long as he insisted on being a "normal friend" "visiting an old classmate," there was room for maneuver. At any rate, his father was a member of the County Advisory Council and could speak to the Senators...

The woman was also terrified when she opened the door, but being in her own home, she still tried hard to appear calm: "What brings you gentlemen here? Is it about our Tan Haonan?"

So her man was named Tan Haonan. This was the first time the man heard this name; before this, both had carefully avoided mentioning him.

"You are Tan Haonan's wife?"

"Yes, I am." The woman didn't intend to invite them in, leaning against the door leaf, speaking very unfriendly.

"Let's go inside to talk." The guide *Paijia* (community leader) said. "It's not proper to talk standing at the door."

The woman originally didn't want them to come in, but seeing curious onlookers on the street, she could only slowly withdraw her body, saying with reluctance: "Sit inside."

The two walked into the main hall. The inside gave them the same impression as the outside of the house: clean, neat, simple and elegant. Tan Haonan's home was in the newly developed residential area of Bairen Town, houses built for "middle class" earners working in factories and agencies. Many merchants also bought them because they coveted the independent plumbing and convenient life.

On both sides of the not-wide street, red brick two-and-a-half-story small buildings were arranged neatly row upon row. The windows and doors were of the same style, clean and beautiful. Flower pots were placed in the small courtyards in front of the doors...

Tan Haonan was also a volunteer soldier. Those who could be volunteer soldiers likely had good family backgrounds. Walking onto this street, Zhang Laicai knew Tan Haonan was an "urbanite."

The woman who opened the door wore an Australian dress, more beautiful and elegant than the village girls he had seen along the way, and the material was obviously better. The woman's face and hands were white...

"Please sit; I'll go make tea for you." The woman calmed down instead at this moment, knowing that showing rush to chase guests away would arouse suspicion. So she simply entertained them generously.

"No need, no need," the *Paijia* waved his hand. "The two comrades have some business; they'll leave after finishing."

"No trouble, no trouble." The woman said and went to the kitchen. Soon she brought out three glass cups. "This is herbal tea; comrades, drink to relieve the heat."

She sat down gracefully. Why did the army suddenly send someone? Wasn't Haonan in the troops? In her suspicion, there was a vague uneasiness. At this moment, her gaze suddenly fell on the coat rack by the door.

On the coat rack hung the coat and shawl she usually wore when going out, but on the top hook was shockingly a "Panama hat." This item was only sold in that store in East Gate Market with a single-bay frontage and an inconspicuous number 82 plate. It was said that any item from there was worth at least half a year or even several years of income for an ordinary person.

When the man came, he was wearing this hat. Probably out of habit, he hung it on the coat rack at the door casually.

What to do?! The woman panicked inside. From where they were sitting now, just a diagonal glance would discover this hat.

A man's hat in the house could be said to be Haonan's, but Haonan couldn't afford this hat.

Amidst the woman's fear, she saw a soldier stand up, salute solemnly, and say:

"We represent the Political Department of the Fubo Army General Staff to inform you that your husband, Volunteer Soldier Comrade Tan Haonan, fought bravely in the Liangguang Campaign and unfortunately sacrificed his life..."

It was as if something exploded in the woman's head. The Panama hat and her husband's death rolled and entangled in her mind. Instantly, she fainted.

When she woke up, she had been supported onto an armchair. Her philtrum hurt terribly. Sister-in-law Meitang was looking down at her.

"Awake, she's awake!" She shouted happily, then asked with concern, "Do you want some water?"

The woman waved her hand weakly: "No need, no need." She struggled to sit up, her whole body terribly soft. An unreal, dreamlike feeling spun around her. She looked at the ground hesitantly, wanting to grab something, but not knowing what to grab.

"Sister-in-law Meitang," she whispered, "Do you have shochu (burned wine) at home? Please pour me a little."

"Okay! Okay!" Sister-in-law Meitang rushed to go.

"Sister-in-law, are you okay?" Zhang Youcai saw her trembling all over and hurried to ask, afraid something else would happen to her.

"It's okay, it's okay." The woman shook her head. "Please continue."

Tan Shuangxi hurriedly took the kraft paper bag from his satchel and read it strictly according to the text. Then he handed the death notification, check, several medals, and a package of "valuable effects" to the woman.

The woman opened the effects package. Inside was a pair of half-finger gloves she had made herself, and a very worn sheepskin notebook, also a gift she had given her husband.

She stroked the worn-through gloves and flipped through the worn-out notebook cover, lost in thought. Finally, she sighed faintly.

Zhang Laicai said: "Tan Haonan was an excellent soldier, worked hard, and fought bravely. He was a good man." He emphasized the words "good man," seemingly sighing, yet also seemingly blaming.

Sister-in-law Meitang brought half a bottle of "Haikang Cane Shochu." The woman poured herself a cup of wine, drank it with her head back, and then drank two more cups like that. Under the gaze of several people, the room was dead silent.

"There are larger personal effects that will be sent back by mail. If you have any requests, you can also report to the Military Affairs Section and the troops..." Tan Shuangxi said in a low voice. He had a good relationship with Tan Haonan in the unit. Although one was a local native and the other an outsider, they both shared the surname "Tan," and they looked out for each other usually.

She nodded and finally began to sob, pulling out a handkerchief from her bosom to cover her face. Her tears washed Zhang Laicai's gaze a bit kinder.

"Did he have any words for me?"

Tan Shuangxi said: "He left words at the end. He said he was very sorry to you, that he could no longer take care of you, and asked you to find another reliable good man."

She shook her head gently, curled her legs up, rested her face on her knees, and huddled into a ball on the chair. Fortunately, this was a chair with a backrest; such chairs were rare in the countryside. The furnishings in this home were not those of an ordinary family.

Tan Shuangxi knew that before enlisting, Tan Haonan was an employee of a local large trading firm dealing in local products. Although not a naturalized cadre, his income was not necessarily lower than those cadres, not to mention his father-in-law was also a wealthy merchant.

He was handsome, literate and numerate, wrote good calligraphy, and spoke very pleasantly—refined, giving a feeling of being particularly learned. He often wrote letters for soldiers in the company.

Rich, cultured, with a beautiful wife and a bright future... and then he died.

Thinking of this, Tan Shuangxi felt a blockage in his heart.

"Haonan's last sentence was 'The moon tonight is truly beautiful.'" Tan Shuangxi played out the memory slowly. "The battle happened at night. When we wiped out the night-raiding bandits and found Haonan lying on the ground, he was already fading. He first said what I told you before, and then said the moon tonight is truly beautiful. That was his last sentence."

Tan Haonan's wife cried again. She muttered to herself: "The moon tonight is truly beautiful..."

This was not Tan Haonan's last sentence. Survivors of that chaotic event remembered clearly—they would never forget it in their lives—his last word was "Pain—" The last sound was sprayed out together with blood foam.

Tan Haonan died very unjustly, simply couldn't be more unjust. After finishing his second shift, Tan Haonan probably wanted to go to the cooking squad to find something to eat. He didn't return with the soldier on the same shift but took a shortcut through the woods, running into a lurking sentry. The sentry shouted the password. Either he forgot or was momentarily confused; anyway, he didn't answer. At this time, if he had shouted loudly "I am So-and-so," there probably wouldn't have been any problem—over a hundred people together for so long would at least recognize the voice. At most, he would be criticized afterward. But he said nothing and continued walking forward. The sentry opened fire.

"He missed you," Tan Shuangxi said simply. "He always looked at the moon at night, always said the moon was beautiful, always told me, 'Though miles apart, we share the beauty due; she and I are looking at the same moon.'" This wasn't made up by Tan Shuangxi. Because of their shared surname, Tan Shuangxi and Tan Haonan had always been close, and sometimes they would chat about family matters together.
