# Chapter 2868: The Qu Family Case

The police officer working the night shift at the Bairen Town Police Station yawned once again. Dawn was breaking slightly. Another grueling sleepless night.

The wall clock had already struck five times. This night shift was finally about to end.

He looked around. The terrazzo floor was still brand new, gleaming under the newly installed "electric lights." Everything around was new. The Bairen Town Police Station had been completed less than half a year ago. Since its completion, the new name had replaced the former East Gate Market Substation.

On the white walls hung the huge police emblem and four large blue Song-style characters on either side: National Police. Below was the "Four Loyalties" written in regular script by Wen Desi.

The night duty officer sat behind the counter in front of this wall, watching over the night denizens of the police station lobby.

On several rows of backed benches along the walls, several drunks who had been found passed out on the street at night and brought in by police were sitting or lying down, snoring at varying volumes.

An old man and a young one—two farmers who had come to the city for small business and been swindled—curled up on a bench dozing. Their case couldn't be handled at night and would have to wait until the day shift police came on duty tomorrow to officially enter the process.

A "yellow-ticket" holder with a swollen eye had reported a robbery and assault while doing business at midnight. Now afraid to return to her lodging, she curled up on a bench waiting for daylight.

The officer glanced at the duty log in front of him. Nighttime work had decreased significantly now because Ran Yao had been merciful last month. When the Bairen Town Substation was upgraded to a Police Station, a new substation was set up on Heyuan Street. This greatly reduced the pressure of night work for the officers. After all, Heyuan Street had always had the most nighttime patrols and police calls.

That said, night duty was still a hard job. Bairen was different from other places—it was the most prosperous commercial district in all of Lingao. The influx of large numbers of migrants over the years inevitably produced some down-on-their-luck types, plus some who came specifically to "strike gold." The public security situation was particularly complex, with criminal cases occurring frequently. Especially at night, it remained a period of high incidence for various thefts, robberies, and snatch-thefts. Even personnel on watch duty who didn't go out on patrol couldn't rest the whole night.

He glanced at the security alert level on the wall—yellow again. Since he graduated from the police academy and arrived at this station, it had never not been yellow. On the other side was the counter-terrorism alert level, currently green.

Two years and one month left, he silently calculated. This was the remaining time of his service period at the Bairen Station. Once it expired, he could transfer to a relatively easier place. Of course, he didn't want to be a stationed officer. Becoming a "village cop" was basically equivalent to being rooted in the village for life...

Just as his mind was wandering, the police station's revolving door suddenly started turning. The patrol officers who had gone out returned. The team leader was a second-level commander. He looked at the wall clock, signaled everyone to wait a moment, pulled a cigarette case from his pocket, lit one, took a deep drag, and slowly exhaled the smoke with a weary satisfaction.

"Patrol's back?" the duty officer greeted. "Any situations?"

"Relatively uneventful." The leader took another puff. He stood in front leisurely waiting—there were still a few minutes until the patrol punch-out time. The patrol group members stood by the water dispenser, drinking hot beverages from the thermal barrel. Each face bore the characteristic pallor of people who had stayed up all night.

One officer suddenly called out, "Is there still coffee?"

"All gone long ago," the duty officer said lazily, spreading his hands. "The Criminal Division has been working overtime every night these past few days. They finished it all by midnight."

"Damn!" The officer who didn't get coffee cursed and rubbed his face.

"Drink less!" advised the middle-aged officer beside him. "Staying up and drinking that stuff is really bad for you."

"The Criminal Division has a big case again?" The team leader became interested.

The duty officer chuckled a few times: "Go ask inside yourself later."

"Another homicide, right? There's been obviously more these past few years."

"There really weren't this many murder cases the previous years."

"So many people have come, all wanting to get rich," said the middle-aged officer. "When I was a constable, this was all farmland. Forget people, there wasn't even a ghost!"

"Want to get rich, get poor fast!" said one officer. "A few days ago, a body floated up at the hydroelectric dam. The autopsy said it was suicide by drowning. Investigation revealed he was from Jiangxi, lost money doing business."

"Poor thing. His family doesn't even know..."

"Why commit suicide? Go anywhere and work as a laborer, or go to a farm for short-term work—you'll always have a bowl of rice to eat!"

...

They chatted casually until the clock struck again. Five-thirty. Everyone punched out and headed inside. Change clothes, wash up, tidy their equipment. At six when the cafeteria opened, they could eat breakfast and get off duty. The duty officer sighed; he had to hold out until eight before getting off work.

He went to the restroom and refilled his teacup with strong tea, waiting idly behind the counter, watching the hour hand inch toward eight.

Fortunately, by this time it was daylight, and the formerly quiet lobby began to bustle with people: those coming to pick someone up, those coming to report cases, those coming to process cases, various liaison and coordination people... People came and went, and the duty officer registered and processed them one by one. He was a "constable" with no specific processing authority. He could only register and handle things by the book, which didn't take much mental energy.

Just as he was thinking about what to do after getting off work, several people burst in through the revolving door. All were dressed in "old-style attire." The duty officer recognized the one in front—it was Xia Zhongde.

Xia Zhongde was a regular at the police station. He had thoroughly studied Australian laws, and whenever the Qu family needed to deal with the police, he was the one who came forward.

His visit today was obviously for the Qu family case from a few days ago.

The duty officer wasn't a detective and didn't know the specific details of the case. However, from the snippets overheard from colleagues in the Criminal Division, he roughly knew a maidservant of the Qu family had been killed by a concubine.

The case itself wasn't complicated. The suspect had been arrested at the first opportunity. It was originally a criminal case caused by family disputes, not uncommon locally. However, after the suspect was brought in, she refused to confess. During the process, she exposed several old cases and past events of the Qu family, revealing a "case within a case." Several masters and servants of the Qu family were consequently detained. According to the detectives, it came close to "taking down the whole lot."

"Comrade Officer, I'm here to process bail procedures." Xia Zhongde was very courteous. With a raise of his hand, the servant beside him immediately took out a document from the document case.

"Bail?" The duty officer was somewhat surprised. The Qu family case involved multiple homicides and intentional injury cases. They had just been formally arrested two days ago. How could there be bail at this time?

"Yes," Xia Zhongde said with a humble smile. "This is the bail order signed by the Lingao First Circuit Court yesterday. Please review it."

The bail document was in an envelope, seemingly flawless from the outside. He had no authority to open it. He only made a record in the document register and said: "Wait here." Then he got up and headed inside.

The Criminal Division was in the "old building" of the former East Gate Substation, as this area had many cases. This two-story building was currently used exclusively by them. Upstairs were offices and the records room; downstairs were the interrogation rooms and temporary detention facility.

The duty officer found the detective who had just come on duty and handed over the bail documents.

"Youwei, it's the Qu family case." He reminded.

"The Qu family's?" Lai Youwei also felt surprised. He casually opened the envelope, and his eyes suddenly widened in disbelief. After hesitating for more than ten seconds, he said: "Wait a moment. I'll report to the section first."

He took the document and walked toward the section chief's office in the inner room.

The Criminal Division section chief of Bairen Police Station was a graduate of the third Criminal Investigation Training Class personally conducted by Mu Min. Academy-trained, a disciple of the Emperor's heaven—this was why he could sit in this position. Although he was only around thirty, he was experienced and sophisticated.

Upon receiving this document, he immediately felt very puzzled. Bail itself wasn't anything special, but the Qu family case hadn't been thoroughly investigated yet. Confessions, witness testimonies, and physical evidence hadn't yet formed an evidence chain. The investigation wasn't over, yet here came a bail document. Moreover, it bailed out multiple people in the case at once.

The section chief was baffled. He read the document back and forth several times. Black on white, the judge's signature and court seal were clearly visible, absolutely legitimate. The bail receipt was also right there: three thousand yuan.

He drew in a sharp breath. This Qu family was really wealthy!

Though suspicions abounded, the court's document had the highest authority. He could only release them first.

He immediately ordered: "Release everyone on the list on bail."

"Chief, this case isn't closed yet. The evidence is incomplete..." Lai Youwei reminded him.

"I know. I'll report this to the higher-ups." The section chief frowned. "Release them first."

"Yes!" Just as Lai Youwei was about to leave, the section chief called him back. "Call your most capable informant. Have him watch the Qu family! You continue monitoring this case."

"Understood. I'll arrange it right away."

Lai Youwei went out and processed the procedures as quickly as possible, releasing the three suspects on bail.

Three sedan chairs were already waiting outside. As soon as the people came out, male and female servants immediately patted them with pomelo leaves. Xia Zhongde was full of smiles, bowing and clasping his hands, saying repeatedly: "You've suffered!"

Watching the sedan chairs disappear into the distance, Lai Youwei's heart was increasingly full of questions. He had personally handled the Qu family case. The case was originally simple: Zhou Suniang, a concubine of the Qu family, had been mistreated by the legal wife and harbored murderous intent. At night, she crept into the legal wife's bedroom, intending to kill her. Unexpectedly, she mistakenly killed a maidservant who was sleeping in the same room that night.

After Zhou Suniang was brought in, she didn't admit to having murderous intent. She only said that it was true she went to find the legal wife that night, but it was to ask about her brother's whereabouts. Moreover, she said she was already a free person and had no subordinate relationship with the Qu family. She had no intention of "killing in desperation."

Lai Youwei was trained to tell whether a person was lying. He could roughly see through them. But Zhou Suniang's words seemed half-true and half-false. Perhaps her intent to kill was false, but her going to find the legal wife was probably not simply for a "discussion."
