# Chapter 2829 Danzhou Specialty Chemicals

Mai Ruibao had always considered himself more knowledgeable about the Senators' factories than his peers among naturalized citizens. From early childhood memories, his family had drifted from Dongguan to Macau before being taken in by the Senate. His brother-in-law had found work with the Senators. As the youngest in the family, little Ruibao frequently visited the Hong Kong shipyard to deliver meals to his brother-in-law, growing accustomed to the shipyard's cranes, slipways, and various machinery. When he came to Lingao to study at a suitable age, Fangcaodi's various "industrial work" and "internships" were routine. So in Mai Ruibao's first impression after jumping off the Gold Star Zero, apart from the terrifyingly large footprint, Danzhou's Specialty Chemical Industrial Zone was no different from large factories in Lingao and Maniao: sawtooth-roofed workshops, pipes running every which way, towers of varying heights, narrow-gauge railways and cinder-paved factory roads crisscrossing, and a nameless sour-rotten smell drifting in the air—many Fangcaodi classmates called this the "factory smell."

But going deeper into the factory revealed more peculiarities: besides the security checks at every factory entrance, critical departments had security police standing guard, strictly inspecting everyone entering and exiting. Mobile patrol teams of National Army soldiers carrying shotguns periodically cycled through on bicycles or rail carts.

Most conspicuous were the naturalized-citizen workers with red "Safety Officer" armbands—more than at other factories—and various safety warning signs everywhere. All of this reminded Mai Ruibao that this was a special enterprise with extreme emphasis on safety.

Before coming, he roughly knew that many products made in the Specialty Chemical Zone were for military use—probably all flammable and explosive.

Facing this dazzling factory, Mai Ruibao was momentarily at a loss, unsure what to photograph. After thinking it over, he aimed his camera at two very prominent giant cylindrical structures and began pulling the bellows to focus.

"Don't waste negatives on the fire prevention water towers." Suddenly someone spoke beside him, startling Reporter Mai. A girl had appeared nearby without him noticing—about his age, rather slight in build, yet radiating that condescending aura of Fangcaodi upperclassmen facing freshmen. The girl extended a thin wrist from her baggy work uniform sleeve—there was an ugly scar on it. She pointed him toward a small building near the water towers: "Inside are fire hydrants and hoses. There are plenty in this factory zone. You're not here to inspect fire prevention work, are you?"

Mai Ruibao could only show his press pass, indicating he'd come to interview alongside the Senators. But the girl remained relentless: "How can a qualified reporter not understand their subject matter?"

"I'm a greenhorn, don't really understand factories." Mai Ruibao could tell at a glance this visitor was some Senator's "disciple"—only they would have such confident expressions and condescending tones.

Mai Ruibao knew such people mostly thought highly of themselves; mishandling them could easily cause offense. Fortunately, these people had been selected to be around Senators since childhood and mostly weren't deeply scheming—they responded well to flattery. He immediately assumed an enthusiastic air: "I just started working at the pictorial, first time at such a big factory." He looked around, expressing half-genuine wonder: "This factory is amazing! The Senators who designed and operate it are incredible!"

The girl showed an expression of "naturally." Mai Ruibao quickly added more fuel: "From your manner, you must be a student of a Senator here? Perfect—you teach me. What are the most photo-worthy places here? I really don't know."

He could tell his humble, eager-student performance pleased her.

"Follow me. Our teacher will tell you what's truly valuable, what photos are worth putting in a pictorial."

The girl led him to a group of tall tower-shaped structures. The Senators he'd come with were already there. Clearly important equipment. The teacher the girl mentioned—Senator Qi Chuqin, whose name Mai Ruibao often saw in newspapers—was surrounded by other Senators from the inspection team, answering their rapid-fire questions.

The towers emitted a pungent stench in all directions. Mai Ruibao was about to take out a mask, but seeing Chairman Wang completely unconcerned, walking around examining them from all angles, he could only hold his breath as best he could while aiming his lens at these strange-looking towers: forest-like tall iron cylinders, enormous steel tanks, supported in mid-air by steel and concrete frameworks. Countless pipes bent into bizarre shapes bundled, fixed, and connected this pile of metal structures like strings. Sometimes medium-sized iron tanks and steel vessels ballooned from between pipes, linked together like fruiting vines. These oddly-shaped behemoths rumbled and spewed smoke and vapor, as if they were living, indescribable creatures. Belt conveyors continuously fed crushed anthracite into openings at the towers' bases, as if feeding monsters. Amid the roaring din, Mai Ruibao, busy photographing, caught fragments of Chairman Wang's conversation with Senator Qi:

"...Early trials had considerable fluctuation. Currently liquid ammonia production has stabilized around 500 kilograms daily..."

"What about ammonium nitrate?"

"Daily production 120 kilograms."

"Not much. That's only forty to fifty tons a year. Of course, we're still in pilot testing, so these numbers don't count."

"Right now there are too many places needing ammonia and nitric acid. Of course, if Planning Commission approves orders, even with pilot-phase synthetic ammonia output, doubling or tripling ammonium nitrate is no problem. Besides, once pilot testing ends, this equipment can enter continuous production. Barring any hiccups, we expect to reach the designed annual capacity of 1,200 tons of ammonia by year-end. Then whether it's nitrogen fertilizer or firecrackers, Chairman, we'll have plenty..."

"What problems are there? Nothing in this world is all good."

"Nothing escapes you, haha. Alright, the most critical problem is that our materials industry is still somewhat lacking. Catalysts and corrosion-resistant materials are deficient. Substitute materials can only solve the 'can we produce' question—they can't hold up once we scale up. Then there's gutta-percha. Supply is intermittent. Really difficult."

Chairman Wang smiled and nodded, offering no further comment. Apparently, this problem was beyond even his ability to solve. After gazing for a while, he suddenly lowered his voice as if asking Senator Qi something. Senator Qi's face turned grave as he also replied quietly. From their expressions, it seemed to be something important.

Mai Ruibao, adhering to the "Three Don'ts Principles," quickly looked away, using his fingers to frame potential shots nearby. He then took several photos of large equipment and workers performing maintenance. He'd originally wanted to shoot some photos with workers as models, but today's lighting wasn't ideal for close-up portrait shots. He only had 24 single-use flash torches in his bag—had to use them sparingly.

The magical product of the towers, the treasure that Senators said could become nitrogen fertilizer or firecrackers, finally revealed itself in the packaging workshop beneath the granulation tower: white pellet-shaped ammonium nitrate granules spread across canvas conveyors, finally falling into specially made lead-lined drums. When each drum was filled, workers lined the rim with wax paper, screwed on the lid tight, then lifted it onto handcarts to be wheeled away. Chairman Wang, oblivious to the irritating smell, watched entranced. Suddenly he asked Sun Shangxiang: "Do you know what these are?"

Sun Shangxiang shook her small face—previously flushed, now somewhat pale: "Please enlighten me, Chairman." Mai Ruibao gazed concernedly at her incompletely wiped tear tracks—he didn't know they were from getting too close and being irritated by the evaporating ammonia.

"This is the foundation of Australia-Song people being free from hunger, and the guarantee of Fubo Army's victory." Chairman Wang seemed thoughtful: "Sometimes the latter is more important than the former. Victory must come first before people won't go hungry."

"Chairman, could you explain in more detail?" Sun Shangxiang wrote furiously in her notebook while pleading in a weak, delicate tone.

Chairman Wang laughed heartily and pointed at the girl student following Teacher Qi: "Go ask her. Have her explain in detail. By the way, Old Qi, I haven't asked your star pupil's name."

"Reporting to Chairman: my name is Qi Kelong!"

The moment the girl student finished speaking, not just Chairman Wang but all the Senators in the inspection team burst out laughing. Sun Shangxiang and the other naturalized-citizen cadres laughed along. Only Mai Ruibao turned his face away, pretending not to see.

Qi Kelong, not understanding, instantly turned crimson but stubbornly held her thin neck straight. The inspection team then boarded flatbed cargo cars pulled by fireless locomotives running on the zone's rail system.

The flatbed train passed several workshops still under construction with scaffolding everywhere. From the Senators' conversation, Reporter Mai learned that this Danzhou Specialty Chemical enterprise was the first fully electrified factory under Senate rule. Indeed, as they walked in and out of workshop after workshop, all had electric lighting. Exhaust fans whirred. Everyone had put on the factory-provided safety goggles and activated-charcoal masks, but Mai Ruibao still felt a nose-stinging acidic smell in the air. Everywhere he looked—those massive nitrating vessels, reaction tanks, and water tanks—some showed bare cast iron, some were covered with enamel anti-corrosion layers, and some parts were actually made of glass. Workers in tight oilcloth protective suits operated mixers. Thinking of the strong acid churning in those tanks that could dissolve even human bones, he couldn't help his hair standing on end. Like the synthetic ammonia-ammonium nitrate co-production installation, pipes of varying thicknesses—metal, glass, and gutta-percha—wound around the various tanks and machines, connecting them together. Chairman Wang inspected various equipment along the way, finally stopping by a crystallizer, pointing at the pale yellow crystals that had dried inside: "What's the current output?"

"Reporting to Chairman: TNT daily production approximately 100 kilograms." It was still Qi Kelong who answered.
