# Chapter 2833 Military Exercise (Part 2)

As if confirming Xi Yazhou's judgment, amid the gunfire echoing across the beach, a shrill bugle call could faintly be heard. White side formed three columns, let out a strange battle cry, and under cover of the smoke, crossed past their still-firing skirmish line, charging straight forward with fixed bayonets. What followed left a deep impression on the hilltop spectators: Red side's companies were separated by dense silver grass thickets. Just as White side's columns closed in, two large gouts of white smoke erupted from the thickets, with fire faintly visible. The sound wasn't loud but drowned out Red side's volley fire. "Could there be mines?" Mai Ruibao's eyes widened. The explosion seemed to startle White side's center column—the assault pace slowed somewhat. But this was only a moment's hesitation. In an instant, the three columns crashed into Red side's line, both sides tangling in chaotic close combat.

"Signal to end the exercise." Lü Zeyang told the messenger beside him. "Have the referee team tally results—though as I see it, the outcome is already obvious."

The weapons that had disrupted White side's column charge were now being carried out of the grass—two wooden cannons, made from local yellow camphor wood, wrapped with several loops of iron wire as reinforcing bands. Mai Ruibao walked around them: no gun carriages; the wooden cannons simply sat on stone props on the ground, bodies still wrapped in uncleared dry grass. Red side had successfully concealed them in the silver grass thickets. One could imagine in actual combat, loaded with grapeshot, they could inflict considerable horrific casualties on the enemy.

"One-shot deals." Xi Yazhou picked up his ever-present riding crop and tapped the cannon barrel, showing everyone the cracks at the base: "Even if it doesn't burst, there won't be a second loading. As long as the enemy's will is firm enough to absorb one round, it's game over." After finishing his critique, he turned and asked, "Whose idea was this?"

The words barely left his mouth before a young National Army officer stood before him: "Danzhou National Army Garrison Battalion Commander, Joint Defense Office Director Zhu Si, reporting to the Director."

"Zhu Si... I remember now. You fought at Wuzhou."

Mai Ruibao was busy photographing Chairman Wang's conversation with White side's battalion commander, only managing to glance this way. That Battalion Commander Zhu Si saluted like a ceremonial guard, his entire being—face and body—taut with tension. Large beads of sweat rolled down from under his red-trimmed cap along his cheeks. Probably just hot, he thought. The pith helmets issued to National Army couldn't compare with the Senators' sola pith helmets. They were cheap goods made from pressed coconut fiber coated with tung oil—waterproof but not very breathable.

Mai Ruibao didn't catch Zhu Si's response, only hearing Director Xi continue questioning: "So you're saying you got the inspiration from the bandit suppression operations in Guangdong and imitated this kind of wooden cannon?"

"Reporting to the Director: Director Lü often teaches us to be good at learning. Cunning enemies will learn from us; we must also be good at discovering enemy strengths." Zhu Si's voice was initially hard to make out, gradually growing louder, as if mentioning the Director's name gave him strength: "This type of wooden cannon is very low-cost, convenient for the masses to make from local materials, and simple to operate—very suitable for equipping village militia to resist bandits and pirates. So I suggested to Mayor Liu that it be promoted across all villages."

Director Xi raised his riding crop—though Australia-Song's various publications constantly featured images of General Xi galloping on horseback brandishing his whip, in reality, basically no one had ever seen Director Xi actually ride a horse—pointing at the discarded wooden cannons and the stragglers of militia trickling back: "So you brought them to the exercise field, along with all the village militia?"

"Reporting to the Director: Mayor Liu instructed us that we must do a good job with joint training between National Army and village militia, must make do with existing conditions, seize every opportunity to effectively improve military training standards, and forge a force capable of fighting tough battles."

Director Xi seemed quite satisfied with Zhu Si's explanation. He put away his riding crop and returned a military salute, indicating he could leave. Messengers ran back and forth notifying the official carriages to come pick people up. Meanwhile, Chairman Wang sidled up to Director Lü: "I say, Comrade Zeyang, you as National Army Commander are rather biased. Earlier I inspected White side—all Sword-Drawing Squad. Never mind Red side adding some spear-wielding militia—even if Battalion Commander Zhu's regular National Army went two-to-one, they probably couldn't hold."

"...What can I do about it?" Lü Zeyang opened the carriage door for Chairman Wang, then climbed into the Red Flag carriage himself, sitting on the same row of sofa seats with the Chairman. "This National Army Commander is essentially just a figurehead. On the ground, how to deploy and use troops is entirely up to local administrators. So what can I do besides being a training superintendent? Speaking of training—during new recruit training, Fubo Army skims the cream first. Then the Navy and Marine Corps come for another haul. The dregs and defectives all end up with me. I've been to the Lantau training base. Well—it's exactly like the Song dynasty's Xiang Army. They're called soldiers, but it's really just a refugee shelter! How can they possibly compare to the Sword-Drawing Squad's professional samurai? Even those Nguyễn military household children sent over—if you ask me..."

"Comrade Zeyang, I understand your thinking about establishing a dedicated foreign legion." Chairman Wang cut off Lü Zeyang's subsequent words: "But you need to note that quite a few people in the Senate have very pronounced nationalist tendencies. They'll have many opinions about organizing independent pure-foreign mercenary units. At minimum for now, keeping foreign units in the National Army system is acceptable to everyone. Since we have White Horse Squad and Sword-Drawing Squad, adding Annamese light infantry or others would be a natural progression. Of course, as National Army Commander, you're just requesting to select outstanding units from within the National Army for a quick reaction force, improve equipment levels—like what you mentioned about adding unit-level artillery to some battalions, equipping mountain howitzers. This way, opposition within the Senate would be much less, and I'll definitely support..."

Wang Luobin glanced out the carriage window at the platform: among those seeing them off was Lü Zeyang, and Liu Yixiao's administrative secretary Liu Bieke, but Mayor Liu himself was nowhere to be seen—probably still hung over. Last night's farewell banquet, Liu Yixiao had been a bit too enthusiastic, desperately plying every Senator with drinks until he'd drunk himself unconscious. Who couldn't see through his intentions? Simply unwilling to babysit a massive state enterprise like Danzhou Chemical, wanting to transfer back to the Center for better advancement. Young people—really too simple, sometimes naive. Still needs tempering.

Wang Luobin recalled Qi Chuqin's request. To be honest, building oil tankers was in the "distant water" category. But it could be included in "feasibility study." He vaguely remembered that crude oil transport was relatively safe—just that wooden-hulled ships definitely wouldn't work; had to be iron-hulled. Plus a whole series of fire prevention issues to solve...

The whistle blew. The inspection team's special train "Americana" slowly pulled out of Danzhou Station. Unlike the outbound trip, the return journey had naturalized-citizen escorts, including those two interesting reporters, arranged in other carriages. Stewards delivered tea and snacks. Guards at both ends closed the carriage doors. Wang Luobin lowered the curtain to block the late-spring sunlight that had already become quite hot, and addressed the carriage full of Senators: "Comrades, let's discuss your thoughts."

"After the Wuzhou incident, the Senate had a resolution: no large-scale military operations for three to five years, focus on deep cultivation and recuperation. But now it seems the tree desires calm but the wind won't cease."

"If Zhu Youjian wants to blow this wind, we can't stop him. But how far and how long he can blow—that's even less up to him. No matter what forces he wants to mobilize for a southern expedition, army assembly must be accompanied by at least half a year of levy collection, troop and provision gathering, general selection, attack strategy discussions, and all sorts of delays and dawdling. Plus Zhu himself is both tyrannical and timid in character—any unexpected incident could cause his entire plan to start over, or even be completely abandoned. Victory won't be hard for us to achieve. The difficulty is how to maximize military victory politically." Xi Yazhou spoke while opening his leather map case, pulling out a large map and using a rack to hang it at one end of the carriage. This luxuriously comfortable Senator's special carriage now had a hint of command post atmosphere.

"Of course, this is Zhu Youjian's moment of triumph. We know Zuo Liangyu's claim of killing Zhang Xianzhong in battle is bragging, but the Eight Great King's foster sons either dead or captured, Western Camp's main force annihilated—that's confirmed fact. As for Li Chuangwang—latest intelligence is he was caught up by Zuo Guangxian at Mawu in Li County. His followers scattered; most were captured. Only his own whereabouts are unknown—we know he's still alive. Liu Guoneng, Li Wanqing, Luo Rucai, Ma Jinzhong, and other bandit units have successively surrendered. So never mind Chongzhen—right now Ming's military commanders are all grinning from ear to ear. Zuo Liangyu alone has swelled to over 20,000 just from absorbing bandit forces. Whether they can fight is another matter—at least enough to boost his confidence."

"Zuo Liangyu is currently garrisoned in northern Hubei." Xi Yazhou drew a circle around Yunxian and Xiangyang on the map with his riding crop. "His nominal opponents, the Five Revolutionary Left Camps, are currently weak and isolated—can't make any waves. If Chongzhen is determined to campaign against the Short-Hairs, Zuo's forces will certainly be one of the main southbound armies."

"Xiong Wencan, nominally the Two-Guangs Governor-General, is currently essentially half a Guangxi Provincial Governor." The riding crop tapped Liuzhou: "Though closest to us, he's also the least threatening."

"How so?" The one interrupting Xi Yazhou was Senator Jiang Ye, borrowed from the machinery factory to work at Danzhou Chemical, taking this special train back to Lingao on vacation. "If I remember correctly, the Guangxi territory South China Army has occupied is only Wuzhou, Pingle, and Guilin prefectures. Oh right, Nanning's been taken too, plus Xunzhou Prefecture. By my count, Old Xiong still holds at least half of Guangxi."

"Let me add one point—taking Nanning relied on a Marine Corps surprise attack." Old Di set down his teacup: "I commanded that battle."
