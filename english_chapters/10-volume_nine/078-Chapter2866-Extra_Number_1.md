# Chapter 2866: Extra Number (1)

"Stop at the city rail station up ahead." Du Yibin stopped the carriage and said to his Life Secretary, "Get off here. Go to South Sea Café and reserve a private room. I'm having an important dinner with a Senator tonight to discuss business. Then... then you can go home; no need to wait for me to eat." The Life Secretary agreed with a sound, got off the carriage resentfully, and stood at the roadside putting on a pitiful pose to see the Chief off. Senator Du pretended not to see it. He tapped the carriage, "To the Chemical Department," and the carriage started again.

"Come on in, I've called all the numbers. Those who didn't come won't be waited for. Those with extra numbers, come in." Chen Shixin called to Tan Shuangxi.

Tan Shuangxi, who had been waiting for over an hour, almost leaped up. He hurriedly helped his mother, whose legs had gone numb from sitting, up from the bench and ushered his equally excited father into the photography room. He wanted the Holy Ship backdrop. Tan Shuangxi had scouted this out earlier. Although after becoming an officer he had the qualification to visit the Holy Ship, heaven knows when he would be able to bring his parents aboard with him.

"Please be seated. I'll go prepare the plate." Chen Shixin checked the shooting records; there were still a few glass plates left. This provided some insurance since not every shot was successful. Senator Huang stipulated a loss rate of seventy-five positive prints per hundred plates. Falling below this number required compensation, while exceeding it earned a "Saving Award."

His technique was skilled, and the loss rarely exceeded 20%, always saving a few extra plates. The photos he just took for He Xiaoyue and her friend came from these "extra plates."

"Wait, it's our turn. We have a number..." A burst of female voices came from outside. In the blink of an eye, five or six girls charged to the photography room door like a tornado.

"Good heavens, this momentum rivals a bayonet charge." Tan Shuangxi originally wanted to let them go first, but he had been waiting a long time, and seeing his parents looking quite tired, he thought, *Who told you to be late! Everything must follow rules; being late is wrong!*

Thinking this, he stood up and gripped the door handle tightly, only opening a crack to speak outward, "You're late; the number calling has ended. Come back tomorrow." Then, without allowing them to react, he closed the door and bolted it, giving the girls no time to respond.

The girls outside didn't know who was speaking inside. They thought it was a clerk eager to get off work. When the door closed, they didn't even have a chance to plead. They stamped their feet anxiously outside. Some wanted to knock on the door and plead, some felt embarrassed and said they'd come back tomorrow, and others loudly scolded their companions for forgetting the time while shopping. For a moment, the courtyard was like a flock of ducks returning to the coop. Meanwhile, inside the room, Tan Shuangxi sat before the camera lens, nervously listening to the commotion outside, praying the girls would leave quickly before the real shop clerks discovered him and ruined his big chance. When the photography clerk walked out of the room holding a black box, Tan Shuangxi quickly jumped up and grabbed him, "We want the Holy Ship backdrop. You do your prep work; I'll push the scenery. Let's hurry and not delay your getting off work."

Chen Shixin looked at Tan Shuangxi with confusion: "Get off work? Not until five..." With that, he pressed the jittery soldier into the seat. "Sit still and don't move. The backdrop is very thin; I'll push it myself. Otherwise, who's responsible if it breaks?" Tan Shuangxi could only sit rigidly in the chair like a clay sculpture, watching the clerk leisurely make preparations, listening to the faint voices in the courtyard, tense about his lie being exposed at any moment, sweat pouring down from his head.

"Let's practice once first. Everyone look at my hand. Don't move and don't blink." Still need to practice? Tan Shuangxi's heart pounded wildly. This was like the enemy already charging within 100 meters, and the company commander telling you to clean your gun first before firing. Although he badly wanted to tell the clerk to just shoot without practicing, he didn't dare. After all, the cost of a ruined photo was too high for him to bear.

"Comrade! Relax a bit. We're about to officially start." The clerk spread his hands, indicating that just now, the worst performer was him. At this point, Tan Shuangxi was too nervous to speak and just nodded hurriedly, trying his best to put on a smile for the camera, hoping the order to fire would come any moment.

"Bang bang bang, we have a number!" A rapid knocking sound interrupted Chen Shixin.

Seeing the clerk mutter something and go to open the door, Tan Shuangxi's nerves reached their peak. He wasn't afraid of them being confrontational; it was just that he could be eloquent with soldiers during battles, but when facing women, he never knew what to say. As the door opened, two girls immediately squeezed in, and it seemed several more girls outside were eager to push their way in too.

The leading girl also recognized that Chen Shixin was in charge. She arrogantly waved the number paper in her hand, "We have a number! Number fifty! We should be next. How can you let people cut in line?"

Chen Shixin first waved his hand at the Tan Shuangxi family, who had already stood up, signaling them to sit down. Then he said unhappily to the girls: "I was calling for a long time just now and you weren't here, so I let them go first. Their prep work is done, and they've practiced. You come and want them to give way immediately? There's no such reason. Besides, when we issued the numbers, there were reminders." He pointed to the "Customer Notice" on the wall of the waiting area outside the door: "'Numbers called in order; missed numbers re-queue.'"

The leading girl was obviously a sharp-tongued one too. Seeing she couldn't pin the "cutting in line" label on them, her eyes rolled and she said: "If they have a number and go first, we have no objection. This morning when you gave out numbers, you said there were only fifty. So how can there be someone after us?"

"This number was added in accordance with the Senate's policy of 'Preferential Treatment for Soldiers and Military Families.'" Chen Shixin had followed the Senators for many years and had seen many young men and women who read a few years of "Kun books" and learned a few catchphrases to use for bluffing everywhere. He handled them with ease.

Sure enough, with this sentence, the girls' tongues seemed to be seized by something. Since the Mainland Campaign began, the tune of "Preferential Treatment for Soldiers and Military Families" had been raised a notch. Never mind that these girls were just graduates of elementary public school attending vocational classes; even proper students from Fangcaodi Selection Group wouldn't dare say "no."

"Then... then..." The leading girl was obviously at a loss for words but still tried to maintain composure and regain the initiative. She suddenly remembered something and said self-righteously, "Okay, we have no objection to soldiers going first, but you can't lie to us and say you were closing just now!"

"When did I say we were closing?" Chen Shixin didn't know whether to laugh or cry. Seeing Tan Shuangxi's face flushed red, he knew it was probably him who had talked nonsense. He couldn't help but find it amusing and could only explain: "We operate normally until five in the afternoon. Once the number is missed, you can't take the photo."

"What kind of reasoning is this..." Below came another round of chattering complaints.

Tan Shuangxi knew he had to come forward. He had caused this commotion for Comrade Chen; he couldn't pretend to be deaf and dumb. He quickly came over, flashed a flattering smile at the girls, and explained in the most sincere tone he could muster, "Ladies, I'm returning to my unit tomorrow to prepare to go north. If I don't take the photo today, I don't know when I'll get another chance. You're right here in Lingao; you can come back any day you want. Could you do me a favor?"

Tan Shuangxi's words were very sincere. Even Chen Shixin spoke up for him, "What urgent matter do you have? He's going north to fight."

"Let them go first." A familiar voice suddenly came from the crowd. Tan Shuangxi looked toward the sound and was surprised to see Yang Zhaodi squeezing in from outside the room.

"Zhaodi, how can you be like this!" The leading girl became anxious, grabbing Yang Zhaodi's hand and shaking it. "It's not easy for us night school classmates who don't work in the same factory to get together. Finding another day when everyone is free is so hard."

"Zhaodi, what a coincidence?"

"Brother Shuangxi, it really is you. I heard a voice that sounded like you and came in!"

"Oh my, Brother—Shuangxi!" The girls suddenly burst into collective laughter. Apparently, they had heard this title before. The topic instantly shifted from who should take photos to gossip, and the scene instantly got out of control.

"Everyone quiet down!" Chen Shixin finally came out to maintain order. "How about this: there are two plates left now. I'll try my best to succeed in one take and photograph the Tan family first. You ladies wait a moment. If the shot is successful, the spare one can be used for you. How's that?"

"Can you guarantee both will be successful?"

Chen Shixin spread his hands: "I can't guarantee that. I can only say I'll try my best. If it doesn't work, you can come tomorrow or in a few days. I'll make the decision to give you an extra copy for free. How about that?"

The girls discussed for a moment and agreed. However, they made a new request: to let them wear the photo studio's clothes for the shoot. These were a batch of Song-style costumes specially custom-ordered by Senator Huang from Wanzi Pavilion for shooting purposes. Chen Shixin readily agreed; he had the authority to change paid to free. Hearing this good news, the girls immediately cheered and crowded over to the costume rack to pick clothes.

Only Yang Zhaodi didn't rush to pick clothes. Amidst the girls' noisy laughter, Yang Zhaodi came over to greet Tan Shuangxi's family. This group of girls were all close classmates from night school. Because they were about to graduate and several classmates were going north, and one girl's factory had issued experience coupons, they had agreed to gather today to take a group photo as a memento. Tan Shuangxi seized the opportunity to also share the news of his upcoming northward deployment. Although he wasn't leaving tomorrow exactly, he estimated there wouldn't be such leisurely time to shop around after this. Today's chance encounter could count as meeting before departure, making the trip worthwhile.

After a few sentences, Tan Shuangxi didn't know how to continue. It seemed many words were piled up on the edge of his lips wanting to be said, but not a single one was willing to jump out. He could only stare fixedly into Yang Zhaodi's eyes, completely ignoring that his parents and the shop clerk were just a few steps away.
