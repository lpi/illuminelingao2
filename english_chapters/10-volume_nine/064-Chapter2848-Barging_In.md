# Chapter 2848: Barging In

"What's going on? A fight?"

He Xiaoyue looked outside and saw a group of maids and servants clustering around a woman dressed in luxurious traditional clothing, charging angrily toward them. The salesgirl hurried to close the door, but a sturdy woman at the front was quick-eyed and deft-handed. She rushed forward in two or three steps, jammed her foot into the crack to block the door, squeezed half her body in, and looked inside. She immediately shouted, "Madam, found her! She's right here!"

The door was slammed open with a bang. Guo Xi'er screamed. Two sturdy women had already pinned Zhou Suniang to the ground, twisting her arms and hauling her up. Immediately after, the luxuriously dressed woman walked in. She glanced hurriedly at the stunned He and Guo, snorted coldly, looked at Zhou Suniang, and slapped her across the face!

"I wondered where you, you little slut, had run off to. It turns out you took the Master's money to buy these bizarre clothes to seduce men! Kneel down! Taozhi, hit her!"

A maid smiled apologetically: "Madam, look, this is a public place..."

"Hit her!" The Madam's voice pitched an octave higher.

Hearing the mistress's command, the servants immediately rushed forward. Although they had no weapons in their hands, slap after slap, hair-pulling... within moments, a beauty like Zhou Suniang was beaten until her cloud-like hair was askew, blood ran from her mouth and nose, and she looked utterly ruined.

The Madam was still not satisfied. Seeing the servants using their bare hands and holding back, knowing they still had reservations, she roared again: "Beat her to death for me! If I see anyone not putting in effort, I'll reward her with forty boards when we get back!"

Now the servants dared not slack off. Fists and palms rained down on Zhou Suniang's body, making her scream repeatedly perfectly. Fire flashed in the Madam's eyes—she had waited too long for this day; she couldn't wait a moment longer! Ever since the Master bought this slut from the brothel five years ago, he had barely entered her room, making her gnash her teeth day and night, yet she had been helpless... If the Master hadn't gone to Jiangnan for business this time, she really wouldn't have had the chance to move against Zhou Suniang!

Heaven has eyes; she had finally caught hold of evidence of her stealing a man. If she didn't destroy this little bitch this time, she might as well throw herself into the Wenlan River!

He Xiaoyue hurried up to intervene, but the Madam was blinded by rage and attacked indiscriminately. Just as her fist was about to land on He Xiaoyue's face, a slender figure suddenly leaped forward, bending her left knee while simultaneously pushing out with both hands, landing solidly on the Madam's chest. With a loud shout—"Halt!"—it was exactly Guo Xi'er executing the "Chest Expansion Movement" from the Aromaschool broadcast calisthenics!

The Madam only felt a pair of jade palms press against her chest. The force wasn't great, but it carried an indomitable courage and youthful vigor. She stumbled back a few steps. Guo Xi'er withdrew her pose and stood firm, her feet steady. Even the guards standing by couldn't help but secretly praise her skill.

Guo Xi'er shouted sternly, "What are you doing?"

Everyone watched as the Fake Kun stepped in to scold them. Knowing it was time to stop, they quickly stepped aside, waiting for the outcome of this clash of titans.

The Madam took two steps back and steadied herself, looking coldly at the two women in front of her. Since coming to Lingao, she rarely went out, but she had heard from the steward before coming that they were the Kun people's seamstresses and also the managers of the shop. Looking at these two girls again, they both appeared to be young ladies. The little girl who had just pushed her away was no more than sixteen, yet she showed her face in the shop all day long.

These Kun people were indeed uncivilized overseas barbarians! Look at the clothes they wore; not only were their necks exposed, but even their calves were laid bare. Bound with white belts, their waists and hips looked graceful, their legs long and buttocks perky. Instead of concealing their figures, they deliberately exposed their curves for men to see! These shameless, lewd barbarians—no wonder that little bitch Zhou Suniang liked their ways!

The more she thought, the angrier she became. She couldn't help but say coldly, "Zhou Suniang has committed adultery and ruined my family's reputation. I am disciplining her. What does it have to do with you two young ladies? Please do not interfere."

"Disciplining? Who do you think you are to discipline someone here! Is this how you discipline people? Beating them to death? You..."

Guo Xi'er was flustered and exasperated, her reasoning becoming incoherent. He Xiaoyue held her back and simply sneered, "This Madam, I have no interest in your relationship or grievances with our customer. However, Wanzi Pavilion is an enterprise belonging to the Planning Committee! You barged in here indiscriminately with people—what do you want to do? Rebel?"

The word "Rebel" acted like analgin; seventy percent of her anger instantly vanished. She remembered the Master saying that this Wanzi Pavilion was opened by a Senator of the Australians, and the customers were mostly people close to the Senators. How could she have impulsively barged into the Kun people's "official property"? Fear suddenly arose in her heart, and she didn't know what to say.

Just as she was at a loss, her personal maid, Taozhi, jumped out: "What do you know? We are catching a thief! Besides, what rule have we violated? We have studied Lingao's laws. Since coming in, we have merely hit this vixen a few times and done nothing else. Don't speak nonsense!"

"You're still unrepentant? If you're not convinced, let's call the police! Let's argue it out at the police station!"

Seeing the atmosphere becoming tense again, someone suddenly shouted loudly: "Wait a moment!"

Everyone turned to look and saw a man dressed like a private advisor pushing the door open, sweat beads still on his forehead. He looked to be thirty or forty years old, not tall, with a genial smile on his face. Seeing Guo and He looking at him, he hurriedly bowed deeply according to the Kun etiquette: "Greetings to the two managers." Then he bowed to the Madam: "Madam, leave this to me."

He Xiaoyue saw out of the corner of her eye that Zhou Suniang had been helped to a table by two attendants. She signaled Guo Xi'er to watch over her and took a step forward. Seeing the man arrive, the corners of the Madam's mouth twitched, and she turned her head away slightly, saying nothing.

"I am Xia Zhongde, a steward of the Qu family." The man kept the genial smile on his face. "This is a long story, please listen to me slowly..."

Zhou Suniang was originally a "Yangzhou Thin Horse" bought by Master Qu for a heavy sum and was very much favored. But after coming to Lingao, Zhou Suniang's "heart ran wild." Relying on the Master's favor, she often disguised herself and went out secretly, doing unknown things. When asked at home, she would prevaricate. Madam Qu felt increasingly that something was wrong. This morning, she secretly checked her belongings and actually discovered a stack of letters proving her secret communication with a wild man! So she brought the servants to "catch the adulteress."

"...Although the Senate advocates freedom of marriage and love, Zhou Suniang's secret communication with someone is suspected of destroying a marriage and family. Madam's action today is also intended to rectify morals and respond to the New Life Movement..."

Hearing Xia Zhongde's explanation, He Xiaoyue almost exploded with anger. What kind of bullshit explanation was this? "Rectify morals"? "Respond to the New Life Movement"? She retorted sternly, "Fine, fine, even if everything you say is true, one clause of the New Life Movement is 'Refusal to Concubinage.' The Qu family openly keeps concubines, yet you talk about responding to the New Life Movement?!"

"About this, Miss may not know. Since arriving in Lingao, my Master has responded to the Senate's call, so Zhou Suniang is no longer the Master's concubine. Civilly, the relationship has been dissolved," Xia Zhongde explained unhurriedly.

"Since she is a free person, her romantic life is free. How can it be 'adultery'?"

"Well, Ms. Zhou signed a 'Love Prohibition' contract with my Master's company. During the contract period, she does not have the freedom of love or marriage. This is all in accordance with the laws of the Senate."

Xia Zhongde spoke slowly and unhurriedly, leaving He Xiaoyue speechless. She looked at his face, seventy percent serious and three percent genial, when she suddenly heard a sneer. Turning around, she saw Zhou Suniang glancing sideways at Xia Zhongde, her eyes full of both disdain and understanding. He Xiaoyue asked, "Is what he said true?"

"If you want to condemn someone, you can always find a pretext." Zhou Suniang threw out a cold sentence and stopped looking at them.

Intuitively, He Xiaoyue felt there was something fishy, but Xia Zhongde's words were watertight. She couldn't very well manage someone else's family affairs. She gave a cold laugh and said nothing more.

"Don't think this is over," He Xiaoyue said, unwilling to let him gloss it over so easily, determined to dampen the arrogance of these evil gentry. "No matter what, you disrupted normal business operations. You will be dealt with according to the *Public Security Act*. The police have been called outside. Wait to see the Public Order Court!"

Madam Qu's face changed. She suddenly pulled Taozhi over and slapped her twice—*Pa! Pa!*

"You reckless little slut! Who told you to talk nonsense in front of me? This mess is all because of you! Go accept your punishment!"

Taozhi's eyes turned red, her face full of disbelief: "Madam, this servant..."

Madam Qu was all smiles now, seeming like a different person, smiling at He Xiaoyue: "Shopkeeper, we didn't intend to barge into Wanzi Pavilion. It was the rude servants leading the way, saying only that Zhou Suniang was in the clothing store. If we have offended you, please forgive us, please forgive us... We will definitely come to apologize another day..."

Xia Zhongde piled smiles on his face: "Yes, yes, we handled this improperly. We deserve punishment, we deserve punishment!" He studied the expressions of He Xiaoyue and Guo Xi'er and added, "Of course, this is not Taozhi's fault alone. These people who charged the door and spoke rudely also committed a grave error. Naturally, they must be severely punished too." With that, his eyes swept over the servants. Two sturdy women immediately knelt down, repeatedly saying "Deserve to die" and "We shouldn't have violated the shop's rules."

Seeing them bowing and scraping like this, appearing like completely different people from their arrogant selves just moments ago, He Xiaoyue didn't feel the secret satisfaction she had imagined. Instead, she felt as nauseous as if she had eaten a fly: it was this style of pushing all responsibility onto the weak, making them accept the punishment that the superiors should have borne.

In the past, she would have been relentless, insisting that Madam Qu herself be whipped. But having worked here for a long time, she had learned some discretion. Leaving aside matters that couldn't be brought to the table, just fighting a public order lawsuit would take half a day. Several Life Secretaries and important clients were coming this afternoon; she couldn't afford the delay.
