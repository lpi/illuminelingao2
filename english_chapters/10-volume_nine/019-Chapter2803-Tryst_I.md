# Chapter 2803 Tryst (I)

"Heavens, it's already light out." The man sat up and peered through the window. The sky had brightened to a pale gray; he must have still been dreaming when the rooster crowed.

"What does it matter? Let it be light." The woman rolled toward him, wrapping her arms around his and pressing her face against his chest, eyes still closed. "You don't have work today."

"It's because we carried on too long last night." The man teased her gently, tightening his arm around her and stroking her back, savoring the warmth of her youth against his skin. The drowsiness welling up within him claimed him once more.

When he opened his eyes again, the sky was fully bright. Through the window came the occasional sounds of chickens clucking and dogs barking, mingled with the footsteps of passersby. The woman sat before her vanity, carefully combing her hair. The man felt a sudden flutter of unease and groped for his clothes to rise.

"What's the hurry? It's still early." The woman fastened her earrings. "The day shift whistle hasn't even blown yet."

"This isn't wise. It's broad daylight now, and the streets are full of people. Too risky."

"If it's too risky now, then leave when it gets dark." The woman giggled. "I'll go out and buy some braised dishes later. Your favorites—pickled duck feet, braised pig tongue, and Goryeo salad. Didn't you like the household fruit cordial? There's still a bottle left."

The man knew she was trying to keep him until evening. Part of him yearned to stay, drawn to her tenderness. But reason told him he shouldn't linger.

"What if someone comes by?"

"Who would come?" Seeing his intention to leave, the woman's voice took on a note of resentment. "Everyone at the factory and that reading club of his—they all know he went off to be a soldier. He's a loner here, not a single relative in town." Her expression shifted to something sly and knowing. "Besides, I'm here alone. They wouldn't want to invite suspicion of scandal."

"Your Chinese has gotten very good," the man remarked.

The woman shrugged it off. "Lucky I learned well enough to read books and newspapers. Otherwise, he would have looked down on me to no end!"

"He looked down on you?" The man was taken aback. "Him? A bachelor, a stubborn pauper who nearly starved to death?"

"Poor he may be, but he's got quite the temper." The woman giggled.

A flicker of jealousy stirred in the man, and he fell silent.

"Are you angry?" She leaned toward him with a pleased smile.

"No." He affected magnanimity. "I'm just a bit worried—your house faces the street, after all. Any loud noise carries right outside."

The sounds beyond the window were growing louder: hawkers crying their wares, snippets of conversation, someone shouting at livestock, the grinding of cart wheels, the tinkling bells of rickshaws.

The man realized he couldn't leave during the day.

Yet if pressed to name his business, he had none. Whatever had brought him to town was long since concluded. Staying one more day hardly mattered.

"It seems I can't leave after all."

"So eager to get back to your yellow-faced wife?"

The man felt a prick of displeasure but kept it from his face, deflecting instead: "After all that commotion last night, I'm a bit afraid of you..."

"Oh, stop it!" The woman punched his chest playfully.

Suddenly, someone knocked at the street-facing door downstairs—rapid, urgent bursts. Both of them froze, their gazes locked on the window. The knocking grew more insistent. In the man's mind, the sound had already become the splintering of a door being broken down, and he caught himself holding his breath.

The woman glanced at the bedroom door in alarm, as if calculating something. Then she rose, walked quickly to the window, and lifted a corner of the curtain to peek down. She turned back.

"It's all right. It's just Sister-in-law Meitang from next door. I don't know what she wants. I'll be right back." She left the room, and her footsteps descended the stairs outside.

The man dressed quickly and methodically. He gathered every personal belonging he had scattered about the room.

From below came the muffled sound of women's voices, indistinct and unclear. After a while, the voices faded. Then he heard her familiar footsteps ascending the stairs.

The woman pushed open the door and stepped in. Seeing him fully dressed, she paused, then laughed. "What, afraid someone came to catch us in the act?"

"Not at all," the man replied with an awkward smile. "Since I'm up, I might as well tidy myself." They both exhaled deeply and shared a relieved smile.

"What did the neighbor want?"

"To borrow money." The woman removed her headscarf and tossed it carelessly onto the armchair. "Two yuan—her family's having cash troubles again."

"Aren't the people living here all factory employees? How can they be short a few yuan?"

"Listen to you, landlord's young master," the woman chuckled. "Her husband works at the factory, true, and the wages are good, true, but they've got too many mouths to feed. Five children, three of them boys—just putting food on the table leaves the couple scraping by every month."

"The wife doesn't go out and find work to help with expenses?"

"With five children at home, what work could she possibly find? She can't even finish the housework." The woman went downstairs again, apparently busy with something. After a while, she returned carrying a tray laden with breakfast.

"Can't compare to what you have at home, but it'll fill you up."

The man surveyed the breakfast on the table: white porridge, salted eggs, spiced peanuts, and small dishes of Australian pickles. Even at his own house, breakfast was nothing more than this.

"This is already quite good." The man pointed at the salted egg. "Just this alone is something not everyone can afford."

"As long as you're satisfied." The woman smiled. "You've become much more easygoing than before."

"Was I cold before?"

"Not cold, just... hmm... arrogant." The woman began eating her breakfast. "Do you know what the other students used to call you?"

"'Young Master,' I suppose."

"Young Master Lamb." The woman covered her mouth as she laughed.

"Hard to believe it's been several years since graduation." The man felt a twinge of embarrassment. "I wonder how our classmates are doing."

"Many have left Lingao." The woman said, "Last time I ran into the Chief who taught us. He said about two-thirds of our class went to other places—Jeju, Taiwan, Shandong, Sanya. Recently some went to Guangdong. He even asked me why I didn't go out to work after graduating from senior primary school instead of settling for being a housewife. He kept saying 'waste of talent' and 'what a pity.'"

The woman laughed. "Lucky I wasn't a publicly funded student!"

"Your father really does treat you well." The man spoke with genuine admiration. "My father acted like he'd suffered a great loss sending my sisters to junior primary. He grumbled about it every day. My sister hides whenever she sees him."

"Treats me well? He was just following fashion and currying favor with the Chiefs." The woman's tone turned flat. "He agreed to let me marry that man because he saw the Chiefs regarded him highly."

Outside, the day shift whistle sounded. Following its rousing call, a sonorous male voice suddenly rang out:

"The last beep just now was 8 o'clock Lingao time. Good morning, listeners! Welcome to today's 'News Summary.' Today's news includes: Senate Chairman Wang Luobin met with the recipients of the Senate First Class Distinguished Service Medal for the Liangguang Campaign today at Bairen City... The Guangdong Region Advanced Workers Commendation Conference was held in Guangzhou; Regional Director Senator Wen Desi presented awards to advanced workers... Please listen to the detailed news below..."

They ate while listening with tilted ears. The news was their most important window to the outside world—especially for the man. His family's business had long outgrown those few hundred *mu* of village land. He had to stay informed about events beyond.

"What did the news just say?" the woman asked suddenly.

"Something about the Senate holding various meetings, then a Dutch trade agreement, I think. Why do you ask?" The man was surprised. Since their school days, he had known her as someone uninterested in world affairs.

"Is there news from Liangguang? I heard peace negotiations with the Great Ming are almost finished."

"Ah, it didn't mention that. The news only talked about troop rest and reorganization. Looks like the war really is ending soon."

"...Go overseas! Go to the vibrant lands of Southeast Asia! The Nanyang Company's immigrant recruitment presentation will be held from the 10th to the 12th of this month at Wenlan River Park. At that time, Senators from the Nanyang Company and the Civil Affairs Department will be present to explain immigration policies and related benefits. To accommodate everyone's participation, sessions are arranged for both day and evening..."

"...The 36th Veteran Placement Conference was held in Bairen City. The theme of this conference is the proper placement of retired and disabled soldiers and their families..."

"...Today's news summary program has ended..."

"It sounds like the war is truly coming to a close. He should be returning soon, shouldn't he?" The man chose his words with care, avoiding terms like "husband" or "your man" as one might avoid needles in a sewing box.

"Mm." The woman didn't look up, only making a sound through her nose. It might have been an answer, or perhaps nothing more than a polite acknowledgment.

"Tell me about him." The man seemed to have suddenly found an interesting topic.

"Him? There's not much to tell. Why do you ask?" The woman began clearing the bowls and chopsticks from the table.

"I'm just curious. Is he handsome? Does he treat you badly? Or does he have other lovers?" The man felt, for the first time, how clumsy he was with words.

"No, he's actually quite handsome, and he treats me very well." The woman's voice grew softer, her gaze dropping. "He's just a bit poor. Otherwise, he's really quite good in other ways. Back then, I was the one who insisted on marrying him."

"...Coal is the blood of modern industry, and Hongji Coal Mine is the energy workshop continuously transfusing lifeblood to Lingao. Since the establishment of the Hongji Station, generations of stationed officers and soldiers have overcome arduous and harsh natural environments, grasping production with one hand and promoting peace with the other, defending the rights and interests of the Senate and the people through practical actions. Next, please listen to the special report: 'Three Thousand Li Westward, Stationed to Defend the Country Writing Loyalty'..."

The woman washed dishes downstairs. The man wandered around the room in boredom. He had grown thoroughly familiar with this bedroom by now and could find no novelty in it anymore. So he stepped out the door into the stairwell.
