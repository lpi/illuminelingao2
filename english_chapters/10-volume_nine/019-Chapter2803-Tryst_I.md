# Chapter 2803 Tryst (I)

"Oh my, it's already light." The man got up and looked out the window. The sky was already faintly bright; he must have still been dreaming when the rooster crowed.

"It doesn't matter. So what if it's light? You don't have to go to work." The woman turned over, wrapped her arms around the man's arm, and buried her head in his chest, her eyes remaining closed.

"It's all because we tossed about too long last night." The man gently teased the woman, tightening his arm around her and stroking her back, feeling the youth seeping from her body. The drowsiness surging from within him swallowed him once again.

When he opened his eyes again, the sky was completely bright. The sounds of chickens crowing and dogs barking came from outside the window occasionally, along with the footsteps of passersby. The woman sat in front of the vanity, carefully combing her hair. The man suddenly felt a bit flustered, groping for his clothes to get up.

"What's the rush? It's still early." The woman put on her earrings. "The day shift whistle hasn't blown yet."

"This isn't good. It's light out, and there are too many people on the street. It's inconvenient."

"If it's inconvenient, leave when it gets dark." The woman giggled. "I'll go out and buy some braised dishes later. Your favorite pickled duck feet, braised pig tongue, and Goryeo salad... Didn't you like the household fruit cordial wine? There's still a bottle."

The man knew the woman wanted to keep him until evening. He was somewhat attached to the woman's tenderness too. But rationality told him it was not suitable to stay long.

"What if someone comes?"

"Who would come?" Seeing him show an intention to leave, the woman was a bit resentful. "People in the factory and that bunch in their reading club all know he went to be a soldier. He's a loner here without a single relative." The woman suddenly showed an ambiguous smile here, "Besides, I'm the only one at home. They don't want to incur suspicion of scandal either."

"Your Chinese is really good," the man praised her.

The woman didn't care: "Lucky I learned well and can read books and newspapers; otherwise, I would have been despised to death by him!"

"He despised you?" The man was somewhat surprised. "Him, a bachelor, a persistent pauper who almost starved to death..."

"Poor is poor, but he has quite a temper." The woman giggled.

The man felt a bit jealous and stopped talking.

"Angry?" The woman leaned happily in front of him.

"No." The man pretended to be magnanimous. "I'm just a bit worried—after all, your house faces the street. Any loud noise can be heard outside."

The sounds outside gradually became noisy: hawking, conversations, shouting at livestock, the crushing sound of wheels, the bells on rickshaws...

The man knew he couldn't leave during the day.

But to say he had business, he really didn't have any. He had long finished the business he came to town for. Staying here one more day didn't count for much.

"Looks like I can't leave."

"Are you in such a hurry to go back to see your yellow-faced wife?"

The man was somewhat displeased, but he didn't show it on his face at all, only teasing: "The commotion was so big last night, I'm scared of you..."

"Annoying!" The woman punched the man's chest.

Suddenly, the door downstairs along the street was knocked on, rapid bursts one after another. The movements of the two froze instantly, their gazes fixed dead on the window. The knocking below became increasingly urgent. The sound of smashing the door already rang in the man's mind, and he couldn't help holding his breath.

The woman glanced at the room door in panic, seemingly contemplating something. Then she stood up, walked quickly to the window, lifted a corner of the curtain slightly to peek, and turned back to say:

"It's okay, it's Sister-in-law Meitang from next door. Don't know what she wants. I'll be right back." With that, she left the room, and footsteps sounded going down the stairs outside.

The man hurriedly dressed neatly. He carefully gathered all his personal belongings scattered in the room.

The sound of women talking came from below, indistinct and unclear. After a good while, the voices disappeared. He heard the familiar footsteps on the stairs again.

The woman pushed open the door and entered. Seeing his appearance, she paused, then laughed: "What, afraid someone came to catch the adulterers?"

"Not that," the man smiled guiltily. "Since I'm up, I should tidy up." Both exhaled deeply and smiled at each other.

"What did the neighbor want with you?"

"Borrowing money." The woman took off her headscarf indifferently and threw it on the armchair. "Borrowing two yuan—her family has cash flow problems again."

"Aren't the people living here all factory employees? How can they be short of a few yuan?"

"Look at you, landlord young master," the woman chuckled. "Her man works in the factory, true, and the wages are high, true, but they can't handle having so many children. Five kids, three of them boys; just eating makes the couple face famine every month."

"The woman doesn't go out to find work to subsidize the household?"

"With five children at home, what work can she find? She can't even finish the housework." The woman said and went downstairs again, seemingly busy with something. After a while, she came up with a tray full of breakfast.

"Can't compare to your family's; just fill up casually."

The man looked at the breakfast on the table: white porridge, salted eggs, spiced salted peanuts, and "Australian pickles" in small dishes. Even in his home, breakfast was nothing more than this.

"Very good already." The man pointed at the salted egg. "Just this is not something everyone can afford to eat."

"As long as you're satisfied." The woman smiled. "You're much more easygoing than before."

"Was I cold before?"

"Not cold, very... hmm... arrogant." The woman also started eating breakfast. "Do you know what the classmates called you?"

"Young Master, I suppose."

"Young Master Lamb." The woman covered her mouth and laughed.

"In a blink of an eye, it's been several years since graduation." The man was somewhat embarrassed. "Don't know how the classmates are doing."

"Many are not in Lingao anymore." The woman said, "Last time I met the Chief who taught us. He said about two-thirds of our class went to other places, like Jeju, Taiwan, Shandong, Sanya... Recently some went to Guangdong. He even asked me why I didn't go out to work after graduating from senior primary school and settled for being a housewife at home. He said 'waste of talent' and 'pity' many times."

The woman laughed here: "Lucky I wasn't a publicly funded student!"

"Your father treats you really well." The man said sincerely. "My dad felt he lost terribly sending my sisters to junior primary, grumbling about it every day. My sister hides whenever she sees him."

"Where does he treat me well? It was just to follow fashion and curry favor with the Chiefs." The woman said boredly. "Agreeing to let me marry him was also because he saw that he was someone the Chiefs regarded highly."

Outside, the day shift whistle sounded. Following the rousing whistle, a sonorous male voice suddenly rang out outside:

"The last beep just now was 8 o'clock Lingao time. Good morning, listeners! Welcome to today's 'News Summary.' Today's news includes: Senate Chairman Wang Luobin met with the recipients of the Senate First Class Distinguished Service Medal for the Liangguang Campaign today at Bairen City... The Guangdong Region Advanced Workers Commendation Conference was held in Guangzhou; Regional Director Senator Wen Desi presented awards to advanced workers... Please listen to the detailed news below..."

They tilted their ears to listen while eating. News was their most important window to understand current events, especially for the man; his family business was long past being just those few hundred *mu* of land in the village. He had to pay attention to the outside world at all times.

"What did the news just say?" the woman asked suddenly.

"Seemed to be that the Senate held a lot of meetings, then something about a Dutch trade agreement... Why do you ask?" The man was somewhat surprised. Since school days, he knew the woman was someone uninterested in world affairs.

"Is there news from Liangguang? Heard peace is about to be negotiated with the Great Ming."

"Oh, it didn't say. The news just mentioned troop rest and reorganization. Looks like the war is really ending soon."

"...Go overseas! Go to the vibrant Southeast Asian lands! The Nanyang Company's immigrant recruitment presentation will be held from the 10th to the 12th of this month at Wenlan River Park. At that time, Senators from the Nanyang Company and the Civil Affairs Department will be present to explain immigration policies and related benefits. To facilitate everyone's participation, sessions are arranged for both day and evening..."

"...The 36th Veteran Placement Conference was held in Bairen City. The theme of this conference is the proper placement of retired and disabled soldiers and their families..."

"...Today's news summary program has ended..."

"Looks like the war is indeed finishing soon... He should be coming back, right?" The man carefully sought his wording, avoiding terms like "husband" or "your man," like avoiding needles in a sewing box.

"Mhm." The woman didn't look up, only emitting a sound from her nose. It might have been an answer, or perhaps just a polite response.

"Tell me about him." The man seemed to have suddenly found an interesting topic.

"Him ah, nothing much to tell. Why ask this?" The woman started clearing the bowls and chopsticks on the table.

"I'm just curious... Is he good-looking? Treats you bad? Or does he have other lovers?" The man felt himself a bit clumsy with words for the first time.

"No, he's actually quite handsome and treats me very well." The woman's voice became lower and lower, her gaze dropping too. "He's just a bit poor; otherwise he's actually quite good in other aspects. Back then, I was the one who insisted on marrying him."

"...Coal is the blood of modern industry, and Hongji Coal Mine is the energy workshop continuously transfusing blood to Lingao. Since the establishment of the Hongji Station, generations of stationed officers and soldiers have overcome arduous and harsh natural environments, grasping production with one hand and promoting peace with the other, defending the rights and interests of the Senate and the people with practical actions. Below, please listen to the special report: 'Three Thousand Li Westward, Stationed to Defend the Country Writing Loyalty'..."

The woman washed dishes downstairs. The man wandered around the room boredly. He was already very familiar with this bedroom at this moment and could feel no novelty anymore. So he walked out the door into the stairwell.
