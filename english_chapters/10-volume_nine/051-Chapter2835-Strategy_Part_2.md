# Chapter 2835 Strategy (Part 2)

"After landing, taking Songjiang and Suzhou prefectures is the first objective. Using the task fleet to support ground forces in taking Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, and Huai'an, seizing tribute grain and cutting off the Grand Canal is the second objective. Surrounding and attacking the auxiliary capital Nanjing is the third objective. Meanwhile, Navy conducts feints along Fujian and Zhejiang coasts, pinning down the Zheng family while preventing Zhejiang Ming forces from redeploying to Southern Zhili. The entire operation adjusts based on weather and sea conditions, aiming to achieve objectives and conclude operations before Mid-Autumn Festival."

"Is taking Nanjing under consideration?" Wang Luobin asked.

"Not planned in the objectives." Xi Yazhou said. "Taking Nanjing would shake Ming too much. Our goal is forcing peace through war—we still need to give the other side a way out."

"Taking Su-Song-Chang-Tai alone would be enough to shake Ming..."

"I have a question." It was Dr. Lin Motian, also returning to Lingao for vacation, who spoke up: "Since we're deploying the Navy anyway, why not go directly north to bombard Tianjin, or land and march on Beijing—give Chongzhen some direct shock. If I remember correctly, we have ports at Jeju and Longkou for resupply."

"Tianjin isn't a good landing spot." Before Xi Yazhou could speak, Old Di jumped in: "That damned Dagu area is all mud flats. Take one step and your leg sinks in—can't pull it out."

"Correct. Also, current-era Tianjin isn't even one five-hundredth the size of the old timeline. From the Hai River mouth to the Tianjin garrison city, which was the Grand Canal hub, is a sixty or seventy kilometer journey upstream. The Hai River is shallow with many bends. If Ming gets some expert advice and positions Hongyi cannons at a river bend, who'd be shelling whom is anyone's guess. Don't forget—the Qing's biggest warship-sinking victory against Westerners was at Dagu."

"That kind of ambush—South China warfare has cost the Navy plenty too." Li Di rarely agreed.

"Also, even if landing at Tianjin succeeded and we advanced on Beijing, Ming would certainly send their most elite border troops—like Jizhen, Liaoning-Ningyuan, even Xuanfu-Datong armies—to encircle us. But Ming's Southern Zhili garrison hasn't seen combat since the Jiajing Japanese Pirate crisis a hundred years ago—combat effectiveness has rotted to nothing. Which persimmon is softer and easier to squeeze is obvious. Of course, Fubo Army doesn't fear any Ming force. Marching into Southern Zhili, Chongzhen will almost certainly deploy northern border armies southward. But Jiangnan's dense waterways plus our naval advantage actually favor fighting battles of annihilation in Southern Zhili, rather than just frontal routs."

The advantages of this plan were self-evident. First, it broke out of passive defense, substituting offense for defense, seizing strategic initiative. Second, costs were relatively low. Other plans all involved massive mobilization and fortification—basically all Two Guangs garrisons would have to engage in defensive operations, plus some reinforcements would need to be brought in. Plan D required mobilizing far fewer troops.

"I also tend to favor Plan D." Wang Luobin stated his position: "We need to take the war outward, bring the flames to Ming's heartland. We must not only strangle the Grand Canal—Ming's lifeline—but also show Chongzhen we can strangle it as long as we want, as many times as we want. And we can annihilate his field armies there too—only then can we puncture Zhu Youjian's war fantasies. As for those peace-opposing Qingliu scholar-officials in Beijing, once the Jing-Tong granaries run dry and there's nothing to eat, will they still have strength for empty talk?"

"Marching into Southern Zhili not only draws all Chongzhen's attention, preventing him from harming the Two Guangs, but several million *shi* of tribute grain falling into our hands would greatly ease logistics pressure. More importantly, the political impact—Jiangnan's wealthiest gentry would face Senate power for the first time. If we can win, and win beautifully, they'll jump completely onto the Senate's ship. So I have only one question: one infantry brigade plus Marine Corps and foreign security forces—seven to eight thousand, under ten thousand total. Southern Zhili's Ming forces, however useless, still number in the tens of thousands. Plus the tens of thousands of Ming troops originally planned to march south to the Two Guangs will certainly be sent to relieve Southern Zhili. Can we win beautifully?"

"Whether we can win beautifully—asking the Army alone isn't enough. The Navy has quite a few issues." Li Di's tone started calm but gradually grew agitated: "From Operation Overlord to the Two Guangs Campaign, the Navy hasn't added a single large warship capable of naval combat. To date, the only new ship received is a collier—and that was only because we rode on the coattails of bulk-building colliers for Dabo Company. Steam combat vessels over 500 tons: only eight. These ships are now entering major overhaul cycles one after another—each ship needs 3 to 6 months minimum. Now we're forced to rely on Coast Guard vessels to blockade Zheng family smuggling—that's very passive. If this plan really passes, expecting the Navy's handful of oceangoing combat vessels to sweep Zhoushan, enter the Yangtze, support the Army, while simultaneously maintaining blockade, patrol, and feint-bombardment missions from Ha Long Bay in the south to Jeju in the north—comrades, you're asking the Navy to fly to the moon." He grabbed his teacup and gulped several mouthfuls. "Oh right, there's also that Vice Minister Zhou in Sanya—Zhou the Emperor—whose head is full of his Mekong River colony, constantly asking when the Navy will sweep pirates southward for him. So where are the ships? The guns? The trained officers and sailors? Go conjure them up!"

"Building big ships—probably too late now." Facing Li Di's barrage, Chairman Wang responded calmly, avoiding the key issue of "no money" and only addressing timing: "Coast Guard recently got approval to build eight motor-sail patrol boats. That construction needs to speed up. Blockade patrols, anti-piracy, and similar tasks—have Coast Guard take over as much as possible, freeing up the fleet. Also, I recall *Lichun* entered dry dock for conversion late last year? That needs to finish ASAP too. Everyone has difficulties, but solutions must be found. No new ships for now, but new guns can be arranged. There's going to be fighting—Finance Ministry will probably arrange supplementary budget. It's just that Old Cheng's deficit reduction plan for this year is probably going to fall through again."

"He says every year the deficit is too high, needs cutting, or there'll be a crisis. What crisis—the market's thriving..."

"Can't put it that way." Wang Luobin was well aware of the current fiscal situation. The market thriving was true—consumer spending figures looked as good as possible. But this came at the cost of loose fiscal policy. Massive fixed asset investment and huge military and administrative expenses had caused deficits to mount daily these past few years.

Though the so-called "silver standard" rigid convertibility could still maintain societal confidence in the currency, the market couldn't be fooled. According to Finance Bureau's secret statistics, price indices were rising steadily. To maintain currency stability, Planning Commission had already begun low-price releases of grain and cloth to hold down the CPI, preventing residents' living costs from climbing further.

Though moderate inflation benefited the economy, exactly what constituted "moderate" was currently being hotly debated between industrial and financial circles. Cheng Dong had already stated multiple times in internal meetings: if the deficit couldn't be sharply reduced soon, the Senate should find someone else—he couldn't do this Finance Minister job anymore.

"Our finances are indeed unhealthy. His worry is normal." Wang Luobin said. "But right now there's no choice. Whether to fight isn't something we can solve by hoping for peace."

"Fight one battle, if we can trade it for three to five years of peace, that'd be good..." Lin Motian said.

"Optimistically, maybe ten years of peace." Wang Luobin said. "Of course, this question isn't ours to decide—mainly depends on debates within Ming's court."

"Stop keeping us in suspense—leak some inside information?"

"Good heavens, you people really don't read the papers." Wang Luobin laughed. "It's all in *Weekly News*..."

"Too lazy to read that thing."

"Alright. Synthesizing everything, it's that within Ming's court, there's gradually a possibility of forming two factions—Short-Hair Affairs faction and Expel Short-Hairs faction... of course, currently it's just a possibility."

"Damn, isn't this replicating the Qing?"

"I'd say it's a pretty normal reaction. After all, these years, quite a few people in the court and countryside have seen the power of our 'weird skills and excessive cleverness.' And we're different from the Qing—19th century Chinese had almost no chance to go to Europe. But Ming commoners and gentry can relatively conveniently travel to and from Hainan and Guangdong. They can easily compare advantages and disadvantages. If insightful people had no thoughts, that'd be insulting their intelligence."

"Ming has internal and external troubles. There's motivation for change. There'll probably be a Short-Hair Affairs Movement soon—that would be a good opportunity for us to gradually transform society."

"Hard to say." Wang Luobin shook his head. "Late Ming politics are very different from late Qing. Feels more complex than late Qing. Chongzhen and the Empress Dowager aren't the same type. The Eight Banner nobility and Ming imperial clan are also different... Some things can't be reasoned by common logic. Late Qing's Self-Strengthening Movement can only serve as some reference, not as basis. Besides, we've already departed from the original historical trajectory—many things become unpredictable. For example, the Manchu entry into China in Chongzhen 17—the way things are evolving, they probably won't be able to enter."

"Sun Yuanhua's great victory in Korea—the Manchus inevitably have to look both ways."

"Yes. Dongjiang is another variable..."

"Not entering China—isn't that even better? Is the Senate so reluctant for Ming to fall by our hands?"

"Our generation probably doesn't care." Wang Luobin shook his head somewhat heavily. "Future generations—hard to say. Rather than giving descendants unnecessary controversy, better we do things more thoroughly now."

The train sounded its whistle again. Speed gradually slowed. "Almost at Lingao." Wang Luobin lifted the curtain for a glance, then turned back: "This trip, including today's informal meeting, has been very productive for me. Time waits for no one. I hope everyone will take stock of the work at hand. Comrades—war is imminent. We must not only win, but win beautifully—and, win quickly!"
