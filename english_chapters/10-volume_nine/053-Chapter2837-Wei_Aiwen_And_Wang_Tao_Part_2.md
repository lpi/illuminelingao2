# Chapter 2837 Wei Aiwen and Wang Tao (Part 2)

Though the Senator Club's historical origins traced back to the public recreation room in the old Bairen City days, as it developed, this place gradually became a physical forum replacing the old online BBS. Many small groups used the "private rooms" here to drink, sing, and play games while conducting private discussions and deals.

But this place quickly became a spot for male Senators to flirt with pretty female staff. Even if it was just a few teasing words and taking a few liberties with these deferential pretty girls, the roughnecks never tired of it.

Wei Aiwen and Wang Tao lounged on the sofa in one of the Senator Club's private rooms. Two cases of beer on the table were nearly finished. Wei Aiwen puffed on a cigar, his eyes following several female servers as they came and went.

Due to Wu Nanhai's insistence, the Senator Club wasn't any kind of "scene," but the servers were all part-time workers recruited from units with many young women like Bairen General Hospital. That fresh, youthful aura was something the professionals at Ziming House couldn't match.

"What, got your eye on someone?" Wang Tao teased, seeing his bleary eyes.

"No, don't talk nonsense." Due to his long work at the General Staff Political Department, Wei Aiwen held himself to rather strict standards and rarely got involved in womanizing.

"Your eyes have gone straight."

"When you see beautiful things, of course you look carefully. That's different from you!" Wei Aiwen spoke with the self-righteous confidence of the intoxicated.

"Old Wei, does *The Story of Pine Fort* really affect you that much? I was thinking of adapting it into storytelling." Wang Tao's eyes were fixed on a tall female server, but he suddenly brought up business.

"You bet. Ever since the Second Counter-encirclement, discharge applications have been increasing year by year. It's normal, really—once life gets better, who doesn't want to marry a wife and settle down?" Wei Aiwen sighed. "It's even better now. As soon as the troops got a rest, discharge applications came in like snowflakes. Those who enlisted early, if they didn't make officer, basically all want out—even some officers want to retire."

He raised his glass, then glanced at the busy tall server: "Like this girl—definitely a migrant we brought back from the north. The gender ratio has eased among civilians, but you think the troops—a pile of men—won't have ideas? Besides, *The Story of Pine Fort* is about active-duty soldiers romancing local women at their garrison. How do you think soldiers fighting up north will take this story? There's already the Foshouwan model precedent."

"I see..." Wang Tao picked up the empty rum bottle and held up two fingers at the server. The tall server nodded and walked away.

"Let me give you an idea. Have your side set the performance at some colony—do a trial run first, see the effects. Meanwhile, I'll go back and talk to people about revising the script. Change the story background to some colonial outpost. A soldier responsible for protecting colony security falls in love with a migrant girl or a local indigenous girl, then stays to put down roots on the frontier... Is that a good model or what?"

Wei Aiwen's eyes lit up: "Jeju Island troops have lots of new recruits who are northern migrants. No discharge pressure for now. And Jeju Island itself needs migrants. If soldiers actually retire and settle on Jeju, they could immediately serve as local National Army officers and government cadres—that would be the best outcome. Feng Zongze would definitely welcome this kind of propaganda campaign. Could even take the opportunity to..."

"I think Jeju Island isn't exactly an unpopular place. And there are plenty of Korean girls there. No need for us to promote it further—those guys have already gotten their hands dirty. Should go somewhere more hardship..."

"Vietnam? Brunei?"

"Those are hardship enough, but right now they only have some National Army units. My suggestion is Taiwan."

Taiwan conditions were harsh—currently one of the Senate's "exile destinations"—so there was propaganda need. Second, Taiwan had many local Pingpu tribes. Encouraging soldiers to marry indigenous women was quite an effective means of stabilizing order and expanding the naturalized population.

"You're quite the thinker."

"Of course, of course. And the storyline set in Taiwan would have an 'exotic flavor' or 'frontier romance'—easier to develop the plot. Isn't that better than using Central Plains as background?"

"Go with your idea." Wei Aiwen nodded repeatedly. "When it comes to making up stories, you professionals are better."

"Director, your rum." The tall server brought the drinks. At the moment she bent over, both paused their conversation, straightening up slightly. Their gazes slid from the bottle along the server's arm toward her collar opening. The tall server's face flushed slightly. She quickly collected the empty bottles and withdrew.

"Hey, hey, hey, watch your image." Wang Tao tapped the bottle on the table. "Colonel, stop staring at her chest."

Only then did Wei Aiwen reluctantly turn back to explain: "I wasn't—I wasn't looking—don't talk nonsense... I was thinking about something."

"Oh good. Come on, come on... let's drink. Rum with soda water, add some lemon juice."

An hour later, the half-drunk Wang Tao was picked up by his life secretary. Wei Aiwen saw him to the carriage, stood at the door enjoying the cool breeze for a while, then returned to the club and casually stopped a female server: "Where's the tall one with the ponytail who was serving earlier?"

The server answered with a mix of disappointment and envy: "Director, Little Qian has already gotten off work."

"Gone off duty?!" Wei Aiwen was a bit disappointed. He'd wanted to understand the situation face-to-face.

Never mind, no other business today. With that thought, he let the server help him back to the club's lobby.

"Director, sleeping in the Bairen barracks dormitory tonight? Or..." His life secretary hesitantly inquired, with a trace of uncertainty and shyness in her tone. Earlier when picking up Wei Aiwen from the club, a server had secretly told her the director was asking about some female server. She'd heard from some savvy life secretaries that when you catch wind of such romantic inclinations, the best move was an immediate proactive bedroom battle to extinguish the man's desires. Otherwise, you'd need the skills for "crying, making scenes, and threatening suicide" to control your man. Without either, you could only pretend not to see.

"Oh?" Wei Aiwen seemed to suddenly snap back, glanced at the Bairen dormitory area outside the carriage, was silent for a moment, then said: "Go home and sleep first. Don't wait up for me. I'm going back to the office to work overtime." With that, Wei Aiwen casually opened the carriage door. Watching his life secretary reluctantly get out, even as the guard closed the door, he didn't notice her resentful gaze.

"That vixen surnamed Qian—just let me see you again!" The life secretary watched the departing carriage, spitting hard on the ground, her eyes reddening.

The wrongly accused Wei Aiwen's thoughts were still immersed in constructing the entire propaganda work concept. He'd completely forgotten about the female server. Women couldn't compare to the satisfaction of work achievements. The troubles of recent days—now he had a fairly complete countermeasure. Getting these ideas into results was what mattered most now.

The next morning, the General Staff Political Department officers found Director Wei in the conference room—he'd pulled an all-nighter—along with four orders further refined for naturalized-citizen officers to complete.

First was investigating "post-battle fear" and other psychological phenomena among combat units, especially PTSD symptoms. Summarize main manifestations, how grassroots officers handled them, and results—to provide material and direction for post-war psychological construction propaganda.

Second was collecting situations where troops had significant ideological fluctuations. Mainly troops' views on casualties, MIAs, and POWs during combat; on the military and civil affairs departments' handling of related personnel; and views and attitudes toward the rear. This was actually an old problem. As early as when the first batch of wounded and discharged personnel returned to Guangzhou and Lingao, conflicts had arisen due to the vast differences between front and rear.

Then there was propaganda work. First, to promote Fubo Army's heroic performance in the Two Guangs Campaign, establishing "Not Afraid to Bleed and Sacrifice for the Senate and the People" spirit throughout the military. Second, vigorously publicizing local "veteran support work" and highlighting local "support model stories." Finally, implementing various specific projects.

"Veteran support work involves significant expenditure. Though money isn't our department's responsibility, we do have input on specific projects. Everyone should brainstorm on this. Don't get hot-headed and launch projects everywhere, then run out of money and it becomes an embarrassment... Even worse is making promises everywhere—failing to deliver is even more troublesome!"

Subordinates began reporting on implementation of various veteran support projects. Monetary distributions went without saying—money could get things done. The key was getting it into recipients' hands. This was something Wei Aiwen repeatedly emphasized. Especially death benefit payments for KIAs—must be delivered point-to-point to immediate family by personnel from the deceased's unit. No transfers through intermediaries.

"...The widespread feedback is that village-level veteran support often fails to be implemented," the subordinate reported. "Especially proxy farming for military families has major problems: either half-hearted and perfunctory, or outright embezzlement."

"I'll communicate with Liu Muzhou on this, see what improvements can be made."

"Reporting, Director!" One of his naturalized-citizen officers stood to report.

"What is it?"

"About the Loyalist School proposal." The officer said carefully. "It's been raised for almost two years, and the Education Ministry still hasn't given a clear response..."

"I know." Wei Aiwen replied somewhat deflated. He'd actually proposed this for years, but Education kept saying "studying it." According to Hu Qingbai's view, Fubo Army and National Army martyrs' children already had explicit regulations for enrollment and tuition waivers, with practical guarantees. There was no need to specifically establish a separate school.

"I'll talk to Education about this again." Wei Aiwen knew full well no progress would come from talking now. So he shifted the topic to selecting heroes and model figures from across the military to form speaking groups for touring presentations.
