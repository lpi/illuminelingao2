# Chapter 2864: Ma'niao Burger (2)

Tan Shuangxi quickly stopped his mother, stuffing the Ma'niao Burger back into her hand, and comforted her, "That was during pre-war training when I ate a lot. I'm on leave recently and not training, so my appetite is smaller. I've even gained weight. I'm drawing war allowances now; if it's not enough, I'll order another portion."

His parents looked at each other and smiled, accepting the explanation by default. His father chuckled, "Today, we count as having an Aussie feast with our son." His mother and Tan Shuangxi both laughed, a sweeter laugh than ever before.

Tan Shuangxi tasted all the various foods, using his imagination to invent the glorious history and anecdotes of these foods in the Fubo Army for his parents. The vast majority of the interesting stories were made up on the spot by Tan Shuangxi.

*The Ma'niao Burger is the signature dish of the Army canteen. The Navy needs an order from the General Staff to come and eat it.*

*The Navy's curry rice looks like pig feed and the smell is overpowering. One bite and your head is full of sweat.*

*The meat patty of the Ma'niao Burger comes in various flavors: pork, beef, horse meat. It mainly depends on what animal was just killed on the front line.*

*Grassland rations boiled into a paste. Dip the barrel of the Minie rifle in it before firing. After one shot, it bakes into a cylinder. Eating it, it's fragrant and crispy.*

*Grassland rations boiled into a paste, adding potatoes and vegetable leaves—whatever is available. The key is to add a spoonful of chili and vinegar before eating. The cold zone version is the best.*

*Grassland rations boiled into a paste. Open a bucket of spicy cabbage produced by Tianchu Sauce Garden and throw it in. It makes everything delicious. It must be the large military bucket; the small bottles sold outside don't taste right.*

...

His parents exclaimed "Oh" and "Ah" repeatedly, lamenting the life of the Fubo Army again and again. The family ate the meal harmoniously. Tan Shuangxi didn't even notice the other diners around them glancing sideways.

When they were almost done eating, Tan Shuangxi felt that the food here was not only novel in taste but also relatively affordable. He went to the counter and bought three cups of "Lemon Black Tea." They had seen this sold on the street earlier, but his parents didn't buy it because it was expensive. Here, it was more than half the price of the tea outside.

The sweet and sour beverage with a rich tea aroma made the two elders' brows relax. Although they verbally blamed him for "spending money recklessly" and "selling a cup of sweet water for so much money," it was obvious they liked it very much.

Seeing they liked it, Tan Shuangxi went to the counter to refill the cups.

"This second cup is diluted; not as tasty as the first one." The owner refilled the water. "How about I add some more tea juice? At least it looks strong."

"Thank you." To find a topic, Tan Shuangxi looked at the war wound ribbon on his chest. "Shopkeeper, did you also retire recently?"

"Yes, I was wounded in Lianzhou last year." The owner nodded. "The wound wasn't serious, but I caught an infectious disease in the hospital and almost lost my life. My body was weakened, so I retired."

Many wounded and sick died in the hospital due to infection. Tan Shuangxi knew several of them. He nodded and said with emotion, "Fighting isn't scary; death comes in an instant. The scariest thing is getting injured."

"Isn't that the truth!" The owner suddenly became spirited. The two chatted a few sentences about marching and fighting. The Fubo Army was still relatively small in scale, so within a few minutes, they found some mutual acquaintances, feeling a bit like old friends at first meeting.

"...But it was a blessing in disguise. I learned this while recovering in Foshan. So I came back to open a shop. I've been doing it for less than a month. It feels okay; enough to feed myself."

"Hehe... Grassland rations boil everything, the Fubo Army version of Budae Jjigae... This idea is good!" In a corner not far from the counter, a man wearing a homespun "cadre suit" was listening seriously to the conversation of Tan Shuangxi's family while writing something in a small notebook in front of him. He had already noted down quite a few things in his notebook. If one looked closely, there were customer flow numbers for different time periods over the past two days, and some feedback comments.

Seeing the lunch crowd gradually disperse and the restaurant empty, the owner started cleaning up while he had the chance. The man didn't leave; instead, he crossed his legs and started reading his notebook.

After busying himself for a while, the owner sat down in front of the man.

"Chief..."

"Don't call me Chief. I'm here for market research. You calling me Chief constantly will scare people away."

"Alright." Old Mai nodded helplessly.

"See anything in these stories that can be exploited?"

Old Mai smiled: "Chief Du, most of it is bragging. That taste of grassland rations... I haven't tried the way he said. Making grassland rations into a paste and baking it dry with an entrenching shovel makes it a bit crispy; the taste is passable. Some soldiers bake it specifically to keep in their bags as snacks."

"Interesting. I'll try it later." Du Yibin turned to a blank page in the small notebook. "Let's talk about the problems during the trial operation phase. It's been over a month of trial operation; there should be data, right?"

"Ready, ready, I've organized it all." Boss Mai hurriedly took out a ledger and a few crumpled pages from the drawer behind the counter, covered with densely written words.

"The first problem is the price. The pricing of Ma'niao Burger should be acceptable in Lingao. After all, for such a big meat patty, buying meat to make it at home would cost about the same. But it doesn't seem cheap either. The problem is, ordinary families wouldn't eat this much meat every day, so many customers say they can't come often. I think this price shouldn't be set too high. Only when customers feel they are getting a bargain will they come often. It's best to have some cheap substitutes. Pork and chicken are still too pricey. I wonder if adding more fish meat would be better..."

"The second problem is profit. Based on the price from the food factory and the number of customers during this period... I filled out that calculation table you gave me. Feeding my wife and me is no problem, but it's not enough to pay the rent. Of course, after the promotion ends, prices will rise and profits will be better, enough to cover rent and such. But I'm afraid of the customer volume... Everyone is just here for the novelty right now. In my opinion, this shop is only suitable for the husband-and-wife shop model, enough to feed a family. Hiring staff would be difficult; it can't be considered a big business..."

"The third problem is taste. Most customers say the Ma'niao Burger tastes very good, but besides the burger, the evaluation of other items is average. Honestly, this isn't a shop suitable for treating guests to drinks. It can only be a snack shop. For passersby to have a quick meal, it all depends on whether the location is good..."

"The fourth problem is portion size. I ate a few times myself. Actually, one Ma'niao Burger is completely enough to last until the next meal, but it just doesn't give that satisfaction of eating a few bowls of white rice. Many customers also say it's not quite satisfying. It's best to add something that can fill the stomach. I think rice cakes can be offered separately as a side dish. If the grassland ration paste is improved, that stuff is actually very filling. If not enough, water can be added. It's just the taste isn't good..."

Boss Mai came prepared, listing more than ten problems in one breath. Not only did he state the problems, but he also discussed his own ideas.

Du Yibin took notes while listening. After listening, he laughed: "You speak about business logic quite eloquently. No wonder the people from the Commercial Division recommended you to open this shop!"

"This humble one made a living opening shops before coming to Lingao. It counts as my old trade." Boss Mai smiled, feeling proud yet somewhat sentimental. "It's a pity I opened small shops over and over, just scraping a living for the family. I never managed to build a big business."

"The Senate helped you open this shop. Bring out all your skills and figure out the shop's business model. Not only will you make money yourself, but you can also benefit those similarly injured and retired comrades."

"Yes, it all depends on the Senate's cultivation." Boss Mai was very good with words.

What Senator Du was doing now was another new trick of his. Currently, it was one of the financial support entrepreneurship projects jointly organized by the General Staff Political Department and the commercial departments. Logically speaking, his essence was the County Director of Enping. But in that crappy place, the County Director really had nothing to do except do sales for the Tiandihui.

So whenever he was free, he ran to Guangzhou and Lingao to "do projects." Quite a few people said he was "not attending to his proper duties."

The current project was a part of the "Retired Veterans Re-employment Support Plan" proposed by Du Yibin and a group of Senators. This plan aimed to solve the livelihood problems of retired soldiers. Of course, with the Senate's current expansion speed, ordinary retired soldiers could easily find employment paths through recruitment and exams. This support plan was actually mainly aimed at retired soldiers who were discharged due to injury but still retained certain labor abilities, supporting them in self-employment.

Besides processing workshops using a small amount of machinery, the projects were mainly low-investment life service projects like grocery stores, small restaurants, tea shops, small inns, etc. The Senate provided venues and goods at a discount or for free, provided free skills training, and followed the route of the supported person operating independently and assuming sole responsibility for profits and losses.

After the Liangguang Campaign, the Senate had a large amount of confiscated property and related operating assets available for use. The startup capital came from Delong's loans. Except for the need to provide loan guarantees, the input cost was limited. If the business project could succeed, create tax revenue for the regional government, and solve the placement of wounded for the Civil Affairs and the military... more importantly, these retired soldiers could become the backbone of town and village organizations, inserting themselves into the lives of local commoners like nails, giving the Senate reliable spokespersons and mouthpieces at the grassroots level.

Such a good plan was naturally supported by all departments, supported wholeheartedly. Naturally, if the project was messed up, needless to say, not to mention how many people would be offended, just the four-word comment "ineffective handling of affairs" would prevent the Senator from turning over. Du Yibin felt terrified just thinking about it.

Therefore, Senator Du was very cautious about the feasibility of the project. Although the plans borrowed from the most successful small businesses in the old timeline, ensuring these projects didn't suffer massive losses due to acclimatization issues really made Senator Du worry and attend to things personally.
