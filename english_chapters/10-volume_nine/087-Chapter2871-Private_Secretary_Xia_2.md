# Chapter 2871: Private Secretary Xia (2)

"Adapting to the times... well said." An Xi nodded, his tone still flat, yet it seemed to carry an elusive additional meaning. "But riding the wave can be high or low. Some can only drift with the current; others can rise with the tide. The key is to find the right 'momentum'—and the method to harness it." His words turned slightly, as if returning to the earlier topic. "The Qu family made it through safely this time, partly because the case itself had room for deliberation, but also thanks to Mister Xia's mediation and navigation, knowing how to find a way out under the new rules. That's good."

He paused for a moment, as if weighing his words. His voice lowered, yet became clearer: "The Senate's enterprise is vast. In the future, in many fields—especially at the level of bridging old and new, executing specific affairs—there's a need for some... 'reliable' and 'capable' people. These people may not need to stand in the spotlight, but they must clearly know which way the wind blows and which road to take."

At this point, An Xi finally reached out and took the brocade box, not opening it, just placing it beside him. "This token of regard, I accept. Studying predecessors' experience is indeed necessary." He looked at Xia Zhongde, his gaze calm and waveless. "I hope Mister Xia can continue to develop your strengths."

The private room fell silent, with only the faint sounds of revelry from outside the window drifting in. Xia Zhongde felt his back go somewhat cold, yet also somewhat hot. An Xi's words were like a thin veil—it blocked certain naked truths while clearly outlining the shape beneath. He understood the hint: An Xi wasn't interested in a one-time thank-you gift or the Qu family's gratitude, but in Xia Zhongde himself, and the ability he represented to navigate the networks of old-era interpersonal relationships and rules with ease. This Senator was planning for the future.

As long as he was sufficiently "reliable" and "capable," he could gain far more space and benefit under the Senate's wing than being a Private Secretary for the Qu family.

Though he didn't yet know how this Senator before him intended to use him, risks and opportunities coexisted. This meant potentially handling more matters that walked the edge of the law or even beyond it in the future. Once something went wrong, he could very well become a discarded pawn. But conversely, if he could earn this person's trust and lean on the Senator's great tree, whether for the Qu family or for himself... the prospects were far beyond what a wealthy family's Private Secretary could compare to.

He drew a deep breath, suppressing the stirring in his heart. His demeanor became more respectful than before, yet lost some of the deliberate fawning and gained some solemnity: "The Chief's teachings are thunderous enlightenment. Though this humble one is dull, I understand the principle of following heaven's way and human nature. Henceforth, I shall study the new laws more diligently and strictly observe the Senate's rules. If the Chief has any instructions, just give the word—Zhongde will do his utmost to repay the grace of this recognition." He made no explicit promises, but his attitude was already clear.

A faint smile, almost imperceptible, appeared on An Xi's face. He asked as if casually:

"Mister Xia, how old are you this year?"

Xia Zhongde was startled and quickly replied: "This student was born in the Yiwei year of Wanli (1595), having wasted forty-two years."

"The prime of life. Is your family also in Lingao?"

This seemed like casual conversation—both showing the intimacy of "one of us" and clearly probing his background. Xia Zhongde didn't dare be careless and replied with a smile: "This humble one's family is all local. I have three children—one daughter already married, the eldest son working for Master Qu, and the youngest still in school."

"No wonder you put so much effort into the Qu family's affairs!" An Xi laughed.

The tone of this wasn't quite friendly.

"Just trying to make a living." Xia Zhongde hurried to distance himself, but then feared this would leave the Chief with an impression of "ingratitude" and coldness. "Master Qu has treated me well. Though just working for him, one must live up to this grace of recognition."

"I hear you're quite impressive working for the Qu family." An Xi said with a smile.

"I wouldn't dare, I wouldn't dare." Xia Zhongde's heart lurched, and cold sweat instantly seeped from his back.

"A refined scholar publicly beating people in a fabric shop—that's not quite proper, is it?"

He had thought that incident was long past—just a minor public security violation, fined some money, given a warning, and that was that. He hadn't expected this Chief to actually know! Not daring to hide it, he quickly stood up and bowed: "Reporting to the Chief, it's true... this student was momentarily confused and acted rashly, causing trouble for the Senate. I'm truly ashamed."

"What matter required you to get physical with shop assistants and even alert the police?" An Xi asked leisurely, as if genuinely curious.

Xia Zhongde didn't dare embellish or shift blame. He could only grit his teeth and state as objectively as possible: "It was to... to pursue a runaway concubine of the Qu family. Called Lianjie. Because she couldn't endure... borrowing the opportunity of buying fabrics, she escaped through the back door of Ruihexiang. This student chased her into the shop, had a disagreement with the shopkeeper, and in my haste, started a conflict. This student deeply knows his error. The Senate's laws are strict and don't allow such bullying. Afterward, this student has profoundly reflected and will never dare do it again." He glossed over "couldn't endure the Madam's mistreatment," focusing on admitting his mistake in getting physical.

"Mm," An Xi nodded. "Mister Xia, the Senate emphasizes 'rule of law.' Everything has rules. Even pursuing a runaway concubine requires proper procedures through legitimate channels. Like in the Ming, strutting through the streets with household servants isn't acceptable. Causing big trouble won't be settled with just a fine. Some things can be ruined by 'small details.'"

"Yes, yes, yes! The Chief's admonishment is right! This student will certainly remember it in my heart. Henceforth, I will strictly follow rules and never dare overstep again!" Xia Zhongde agreed repeatedly, shaken.

An Xi, seeing his submissive attitude, didn't pursue it further. Changing topics, he seemed to remember something: "Speaking of the Qu family's inner household matters... I've heard that after the Qu family came to Lingao, they treated the former concubines as company employees and even signed some kind of... 'romance prohibition' contract? This approach is quite interesting. Was it your idea?"

Seeing the topic turn to something he was proud of, Xia Zhongde relaxed slightly. With caution mixed with an imperceptible hint of pride, he said: "Reporting to the Chief, it was indeed this humble one's modest suggestion. Mainly to conform to the Senate's promoted... ah, the New Life Movement, and also for 'compliance.' Converting concubine status to employment relationships clarifies rights and obligations, also avoiding complications from old-style family relationships. This 'romance prohibition' clause also referenced the requirements in relevant Senate regulations regarding employee discipline and morality, ensuring they... stay in their place, not affecting company reputation or family harmony."

"Good, knowing how to adapt and grasping the spirit of the new regulations." An Xi nodded approvingly, which steadied Xia Zhongde's heart somewhat. But the following words stirred waves in his mind: "Mister Xia, being a Private Secretary for a wealthy family like the Qu's, handling these inner household disputes and land trivialities, has limited scope and foreseeable career prospects."

Xia Zhongde understood this was the critical juncture. He immediately assumed an expression of respectful attention.

An Xi leaned forward slightly, his voice lowering further with a guiding intent: "The Senate's legal system is completely different from the Ming laws you're familiar with. There's not only criminal law but also civil and commercial law, involving contracts, companies, finance, trade... In these fields, the tricks of traditional litigation masters aren't enough anymore. The new society needs those who understand new law and can provide professional services for clients under the new rules... lawyers."

"Lawyers..." Xia Zhongde murmured, repeating this new term, a glint flashing in his eyes. He wasn't entirely unfamiliar with this. He had long noticed this emerging profession in the Senate's judicial system. He had observed court trials; he read every issue of the monthly *Judicial Rulings*. Lawyers weren't like traditional litigation masters who could only focus on manipulating petition wording and polishing text games. They emphasized the application of evidence, procedure, and substantive law.

An Xi continued with the reading list, listing *Fundamentals of Jurisprudence*, *Introduction to the Senate Legal System*, *Detailed Commentary on Civil Law General Provisions*, *Commercial Law Draft Annotations*, *Principles and Cases of Civil Procedure*, *Rules and Practice of Evidence*, *Standard Contract Formats and Common Clause Analysis*, *Theory of Property Rights*, *Fundamentals of Tort Liability Law*, and the *Collected Judicial Interpretations of the Arbitration Tribunal*.

Xia Zhongde, with his excellent memory, memorized each one as An Xi spoke.

"Finally," An Xi's tone became somewhat meaningful, "there's a book called *Legislative Spirit and Jurisprudential Origins of the Senate*. You can read it slowly. This book can help you understand why we have established such laws—what reasoning lies behind them. Only by understanding these can you truly 'follow heaven's way and human nature.'"

This last sentence struck Xia Zhongde's heart. He immediately understood this book's special weight—it concerned stance and ideology. He bowed solemnly once more: "This student remembers! I will certainly find all the books the Chief has listed, study them diligently, and never fail to meet expectations!"

An Xi watched the excitement and gravity flickering in his eyes, knowing this groundwork had taken effect. He picked up his teacup again, his tone returning to normal: "The path has been pointed out; the scriptures have been given to you. How you study them and what you can make of it is up to you. Alright, the tea's gone cold. Let's change it."

Xia Zhongde hurriedly agreed, personally rising to change the tea for An Xi, presenting it respectfully with both hands. His movements were more composed than before.
