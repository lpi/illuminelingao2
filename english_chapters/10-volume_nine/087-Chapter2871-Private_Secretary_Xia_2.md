# Chapter 2871: Private Secretary Xia (2)

"Adapting to the times... well said." An Xi nodded, his tone flat yet carrying some elusive meaning. "But riding the wave can carry one high or low. Some merely drift with the current; others rise with the tide. The key lies in finding the right 'momentum'—and mastering how to harness it." His words shifted slightly, circling back to their earlier topic. "The Qu family weathered this storm safely, partly because the case itself left room for deliberation, but also thanks to Mister Xia's mediation and navigation—knowing how to find a path forward under the new rules. That is commendable."

He paused, as if weighing his next words. His voice dropped lower yet grew clearer: "The Senate's enterprise is vast. In the future, across many fields—especially at the level of bridging old and new, executing specific affairs—there will be need for certain... 'reliable' and 'capable' individuals. Such people may not need to stand in the spotlight, but they must know clearly which way the wind blows and which road to take."

At this, An Xi finally reached out and accepted the brocade box. He did not open it, merely setting it beside him. "This token of regard, I accept. Studying the experience of predecessors is indeed necessary." He regarded Xia Zhongde, his gaze calm and still as water. "I trust Mister Xia will continue to develop his strengths."

The private room fell silent. Only the faint sounds of revelry drifted in from outside the window. Xia Zhongde felt his back grow cold yet somehow also flush with heat. An Xi's words were like a thin veil—obscuring certain naked truths while clearly outlining the shape beneath. He understood the implication: An Xi had no interest in a one-time gift of thanks or the Qu family's gratitude. What interested him was Xia Zhongde himself, and the ability he represented—the skill to navigate the intricate networks of old-era relationships and rules with practiced ease. This Senator was planning for the future.

So long as he proved sufficiently "reliable" and "capable," he could gain far more room and benefit under the Senate's protection than he ever could as a Private Secretary for the Qu family.

Though he did not yet know how this Senator intended to use him, risk and opportunity were two sides of the same coin. This path might mean handling more matters that walked the edge of the law—or beyond it—in times to come. Should anything go wrong, he could easily become a discarded pawn. But conversely, if he could earn this man's trust and shelter beneath the Senator's great tree, the prospects—whether for the Qu family or for himself—would far surpass anything a wealthy family's Private Secretary could hope for.

He drew a deep breath, suppressing the stirring in his heart. His demeanor became more respectful than before, yet shed its earlier deliberate fawning and gained a certain gravity: "The Chief's teachings are thunderous enlightenment. Though this humble one is dull, I understand the principle of following heaven's way and human nature. Henceforth, I shall study the new laws more diligently and strictly observe the Senate's rules. If the Chief has any instructions, he need only give the word—Zhongde will spare no effort to repay the grace of this recognition." He made no explicit promises, but his stance was already clear.

A faint smile, nearly imperceptible, appeared on An Xi's face. He asked as if in passing:

"Mister Xia, how old are you this year?"

Xia Zhongde started, then quickly replied: "This student was born in the Yiwei year of Wanli—1595—having squandered forty-two years."

"The prime of life. Is your family here in Lingao as well?"

This seemed like casual conversation—both conveying the intimacy of "one of us" and clearly probing his background. Xia Zhongde dared not be careless and replied with a smile: "This humble one's family is all local. I have three children—one daughter already married, my eldest son working for Master Qu, and the youngest still in school."

"No wonder you devote such effort to the Qu family's affairs!" An Xi laughed.

The tone was not entirely friendly.

"Just trying to make a living." Xia Zhongde hurried to distance himself, but then feared this might leave the Chief with an impression of ingratitude and coldness. "Master Qu has treated me well. Though merely working for him, one must live up to such recognition."

"I hear you're quite formidable in the Qu family's service." An Xi smiled.

"I wouldn't dare, I wouldn't dare." Xia Zhongde's heart lurched, and cold sweat instantly seeped from his back.

"A refined scholar publicly beating people in a fabric shop—that's hardly proper, is it?"

He had thought that incident long past—just a minor public security violation, settled with a fine and a warning. He had not expected this Chief to know of it. Not daring to conceal anything, he quickly rose and bowed: "Reporting to the Chief, it is true... This student was momentarily confused and acted rashly, causing trouble for the Senate. I am truly ashamed."

"What matter required you to come to blows with shop assistants and even alert the police?" An Xi inquired leisurely, as if genuinely curious.

Xia Zhongde dared not embellish or shift blame. Gritting his teeth, he stated as objectively as possible: "It was to... to pursue a runaway concubine of the Qu family. Called Lianjie. Because she could not endure... she seized an opportunity while buying fabrics to escape through the back door of Ruihexiang. This student chased her into the shop, had a disagreement with the shopkeeper, and in my haste, started a conflict. This student knows well his error. The Senate's laws are strict and do not permit such bullying. Afterward, I have reflected deeply and will never dare do so again." He glossed over "could not endure the Madam's mistreatment," focusing instead on admitting his fault in resorting to violence.

"Mm." An Xi nodded. "Mister Xia, the Senate emphasizes 'rule of law.' Everything follows rules. Even pursuing a runaway concubine requires proper procedures through legitimate channels. Parading through the streets with household servants as in Ming times is no longer acceptable. Cause serious trouble, and it won't be settled with just a fine. Some things can be ruined by 'small details.'"

"Yes, yes, yes! The Chief's admonishment is correct! This student will certainly engrave it upon my heart. Henceforth, I will strictly follow the rules and never dare overstep again!" Xia Zhongde agreed repeatedly, visibly shaken.

Seeing his submissive attitude, An Xi did not press further. Changing the subject, he seemed to recall something: "Speaking of the Qu family's inner household matters... I have heard that after the Qu family came to Lingao, they treated their former concubines as company employees and even signed some kind of... 'romance prohibition' contract? This approach is quite interesting. Was it your idea?"

Finding the topic turn to something he took pride in, Xia Zhongde relaxed slightly. With caution mixed with an imperceptible hint of satisfaction, he said: "Reporting to the Chief, it was indeed this humble one's modest suggestion. Primarily to conform to the Senate's promoted... ah, the New Life Movement, and also for 'compliance.' Converting concubine status to employment relationships clarifies rights and obligations while avoiding complications from old-style family arrangements. This 'romance prohibition' clause also referenced requirements in relevant Senate regulations regarding employee discipline and morality, ensuring they... remain in their place, neither affecting company reputation nor family harmony."

"Good. You know how to adapt and have grasped the spirit of the new regulations." An Xi nodded approvingly, which steadied Xia Zhongde's heart somewhat. But the words that followed stirred fresh waves in his mind: "Mister Xia, being a Private Secretary for a wealthy family like the Qu's—handling these inner household disputes and land trivialities—offers limited scope and foreseeable career prospects."

Xia Zhongde understood this was the critical juncture. He immediately assumed an expression of respectful attention.

An Xi leaned forward slightly, his voice dropping further with guiding intent: "The Senate's legal system is entirely different from the Ming laws you are familiar with. There is not only criminal law but also civil and commercial law, involving contracts, companies, finance, trade... In these fields, the tricks of traditional litigation masters are no longer sufficient. The new society needs those who understand new law and can provide professional services for clients under the new rules... lawyers."

"Lawyers..." Xia Zhongde murmured, repeating the new term, a glint flashing in his eyes. He was not entirely unfamiliar with this. He had long noticed this emerging profession within the Senate's judicial system. He had observed court trials; he read every issue of the monthly *Judicial Rulings*. Lawyers were not like traditional litigation masters who could only focus on manipulating petition wording and polishing textual games. They emphasized the application of evidence, procedure, and substantive law.

An Xi continued with his reading list, naming *Fundamentals of Jurisprudence*, *Introduction to the Senate Legal System*, *Detailed Commentary on Civil Law General Provisions*, *Commercial Law Draft Annotations*, *Principles and Cases of Civil Procedure*, *Rules and Practice of Evidence*, *Standard Contract Formats and Common Clause Analysis*, *Theory of Property Rights*, *Fundamentals of Tort Liability Law*, and the *Collected Judicial Interpretations of the Arbitration Tribunal*.

Xia Zhongde, blessed with an excellent memory, committed each title to mind as An Xi spoke.

"Finally," An Xi's tone grew somewhat meaningful, "there is a book called *Legislative Spirit and Jurisprudential Origins of the Senate*. You may read it slowly. This book can help you understand why we have established such laws—what reasoning lies behind them. Only by understanding these can you truly 'follow heaven's way and human nature.'"

This last sentence struck Xia Zhongde to the core. He understood at once the book's special weight—it concerned stance and ideology. He bowed solemnly once more: "This student remembers! I will certainly find every book the Chief has listed, study them diligently, and never fail to meet expectations!"

An Xi observed the excitement and gravity flickering in his eyes, knowing his groundwork had taken effect. He lifted his teacup again, his tone returning to normal: "The path has been pointed out; the scriptures have been given to you. How you study them and what you make of it is up to you. Alright, the tea has gone cold. Let us change it."

Xia Zhongde hurriedly agreed, personally rising to refresh An Xi's tea and presenting it respectfully with both hands. His movements were more composed than before.
