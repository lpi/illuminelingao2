# Chapter 2826 Partners

Dingding had already come to view Sikade as a "partner" rather than a "business partner" like Dr. Shi. First, because the Commercial Department had considerable power, especially its influence over overseas stations, far beyond what other departments could match. Second, since Sikade's election loss, though he still held the title of Colonial Trade Department head, he'd actually become a marginalized figure. The two somewhat shared a sense of fellow sufferers—and naturally also had a strong desire to "reclaim glory."

Dingding first ordered food and drinks, then probed about his earlier visit to Dr. Shi. He boasted about how warmly he'd been welcomed at the Health Department, with so many visitors he'd barely escaped to meet Sikade. He also hinted that for the sake of cooperation, Shi Niaoren had arranged at least ten nurses to line up and welcome him.

Sikade of course didn't believe his nonsense, but he understood Dingding's meaning: Shi Niaoren had already agreed to cooperate.

"With him willing to cooperate, your matter is half done." Sikade smiled. "Now his barefoot doctor plan will forever have your name on it."

"Oh no, no—I'm not after that empty fame." Dingding quickly protested. "With the northern advance and southern expansion in full swing, we in Propaganda should also make some contribution, shouldn't we..."

"Bullshit! Stop putting gold on your own face." Sikade tore off a chicken leg from the clay pot chicken, gnawing at it. "Talk seriously now."

"What I'm saying is serious." Dingding said. "Don't you want to make some new achievements?"

This hit right at Sikade's heart. Since the Nanyang Company was established, "colonization" really had nothing to do with him anymore. As for trade, overseas trade was in the stable growth phase, but the growth rate wasn't as rapid as before. Mainland trade had even declined due to the Northern Expedition.

Trade was an important growth point for the Senate's economy, a stabilizer. How to "maintain growth" had become Sikade's greatest concern.

Originally, as the Senate's largest import-export trader, he didn't concern himself with distribution—goods sold was mission complete; how to sell was the channel's business. But now with export growth declining, how to get channels to sell faster became his concern. Otherwise, he wouldn't have thought of "product placement."

"Achievements must naturally be made. Product placement is my trial run. If response is good, I'll consider new investments." Sikade immediately assumed a "depends on your performance" attitude.

"Rest assured about advertising. Though I'm neither in arts nor advertising, I do have a few talented people in reserve." Dingding immediately thumped his chest. "But I also have a few requests."

His request was that what ads to place would be provided by Sikade, but how specifically to place them would be decided by Propaganda.

"Colonial Trade just needs to be the coal boss. Definitely don't meddle in screenwriting and directing work." Dingding said.

"Don't worry. With that little artistic form of yours, I can't be bothered to interfere." Sikade winked. "Wait until you have management rights to Linlaiwood, then we'll discuss specific cooperation projects."

"You really have it figured out." Dingding laughed. "Rest assured, when the time comes, I'll definitely help push your people..."

Seeing the atmosphere was harmonious, Dingding turned to the main topic: "The cooperation arrangement with the military and Livelihood Ministry is as follows: they select key areas like Zhaoqing, Chaozhou, Nanning, and Wuzhou—all places with military camps or quarantine camps. Using existing barracks, they'll set up classrooms and dormitories, equipped with guards and logistics personnel. I'll dispatch a few naturalized-citizen cadres stationed under the identity of *Lingao Times* correspondents to handle daily operations. First phase focuses on barefoot doctor training—teachers and materials provided by Shi Niaoren. Later, when we've collected enough arts workers, we'll do arts product training—teachers and materials we provide ourselves. At the same time, they'll also do overseas correspondent reporting for *Lingao Times*, covering how various overseas stations faithfully carry out Senate missions, saving the suffering masses."

Dingding toasted Sikade again and said quietly: "Actually, this part isn't much trouble, won't add much cost. Almost all overseas stations have quarantine camps. They already have literacy class teachers that can be fully utilized. Of course, their level is too low for 'international high schools.' So my positioning is study-abroad 'preparatory'—letting those willing to come to Lingao study first learn Mandarin, Pinyin, and get used to reading and using simplified characters. These three, any naturalized citizen with junior primary education can handle. Doesn't Hu Qingbai think there are too many junior primary teachers? Doesn't he have enough junior primary schools to absorb them? We'll help him absorb some."

Sikade listened to Dingding's endless stream of words and laughed: "You've got lots of ideas! Truly a cultured man! But your exporting artistic works I can understand—what's with getting so enthusiastic about barefoot doctors with Old Shi? Sure, it counts as part of the international student plan, but overall, the Health sector gains more, doesn't it?"

"Of course they gain more, but I don't come away empty-handed either. What I want is really just a name. Just as you said earlier. Originally, what did their 'Simplified General Practitioner Training Plan' have to do with me? With this arrangement, I'm now on record for this plan. Don't underestimate this 'name.' For us in propaganda, frankly speaking, what we want is 'influence.' Invisible and intangible, but tremendously useful in reality."

"So that's how it is. Hahaha." Sikade laughed and poured him brandy. "Another drink!"

Dingding, influenced by his wife, habitually sipped hard liquor with ice or soda. He had this much capacity. He immediately filled his glass with natural soda water, added a slice of lemon, then leisurely took a big gulp.

With the wine's momentum, his interest rose. He began expounding:

"Old Si, do you think just putting on a few puppet shows and telling some storytelling segments can peacefully evolve the Ming people? How could it be that easy? To instill any concept in someone—doesn't matter what concept—you have to proceed in three steps. First step: gain trust. Make them believe you, or at least lower their guard. In the old timeline, it was rent and interest reduction; we do Heaven and Earth Society demonstration households—all for this purpose. Second step: integrate into life. You have to make them unable to do without you. Those American movies and TV dramas were initially given free to China—just broadcast them. Get you to want to watch, love to watch, make it part of your life. Third step is instilling concepts. Subtly and repeatedly drumming the same thing into you, saying it from different angles for years, and it becomes your concept. Conquering people by force can't last, but cultural conquest—that's forever."

This wasn't fresh knowledge for Sikade. He came from foreign trade background; this routine was all too clear to him. When a country's cultural export was strong, its products' popularity in international markets would also become very high. These were complementary.

But Dingding was having fun talking, so he didn't interrupt—just refilled his glass. The two clinked cups.

Dingding drank and became even more animated: "If the army just steamrolled over, we could do whatever we wanted. But we can't swallow it in one bite, can we? What gains trust in Ming? Deliver medicine! With this start, our pharmaceuticals can penetrate the Ming market. Then come various other goods, including cultural products. Finally, the concepts we want to instill: 'Australia-Song good, Ming bad.' The remaining conclusions—let Ming's people reach them themselves under this concept."

Then he rambled on for over an hour about "artistic conquest" and "cultural governance" concepts.

Sikade made an expression of utmost admiration: "Director Ding, Old Ding... I think you should be the next term's Secretary of State."

The two drank while exchanging commercial flattery. Seeing the atmosphere was right, Sikade spoke:

"Chief Editor Ding! I have a small favor to ask." He pulled several papers from his pocket. "Regarding current commercial enterprise management issues, we... Colonial Trade has also done some research. This counts as our professional work, after all—we do manage commerce. Please provide some guidance."

"Certainly, certainly." Dingding took them and unfolded—they were several articles. He scanned the titles:

*Dabo Shipping: Sailing Toward the Future*

*The Predicament of Leizhou Sugar Industry*

*Looking at Private Capital's Role Through Hangzhou Station's Japan Trade*

*Can the Guangzhou Grand World Model Be Replicated*

*Research on Runshitang's Business Model*

Without reading the content, Dingding already had a vague feeling. If these articles' subjects had anything in common, it was that most were enterprises started by overseas stations rather than directly invested and controlled by the Planning Commission. To analogize, perhaps similar to regional state-owned enterprises. He casually picked up one and flipped through. The content was nothing but old-timeline institutional rigidity causes, plus some bad signs in this timeline, arguing these state enterprises were or would be developing large-enterprise diseases.

"Old Si, are you doing pure theoretical analysis? Or is there something specific?" Dingding asked quite cautiously.

He'd already vaguely guessed Sikade's thinking. He wanted to use these articles to expand overseas stations' authority—allowing overseas stations to use local capital to establish joint ventures. The Nanyang Company had carved out such a large territory; could Colonial Trade not be jealous? Naturally, certain areas had to be reclaimed. Southeast Asia wasn't convenient to openly interfere in, but the mainland was another matter entirely.

Sikade just smiled without speaking. The smile carried a hint of forced awkwardness. After a moment, he said: "Just consider it some theoretical exploration by our department. Summarizing experience."

"Old Si, I'll take these things, make some edits, publish them serially in *Morning Star*, pick one or two for *Lingao Times*, space the timing out a bit to avoid bad impressions." Dingding smiled and tucked all the documents into his briefcase.
