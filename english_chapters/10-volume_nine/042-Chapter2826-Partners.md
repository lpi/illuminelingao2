# Chapter 2826 Partners

Dingding had come to regard Sikade as a true "partner" rather than merely a "business contact" like Dr. Shi. Two factors shaped this view. First, the Commercial Department wielded considerable power, particularly its influence over overseas stations—authority that far exceeded what other departments could muster. Second, since his election defeat, Sikade had become a marginalized figure despite retaining his title as head of the Colonial Trade Department. The two men shared a certain kinship of the dispossessed, united by their burning desire to reclaim former glory.

Dingding ordered food and drinks first, then probed about Sikade's earlier visit to Dr. Shi. He boasted extravagantly about his reception at the Health Department—so many visitors had sought him out that he'd barely managed to escape in time for this meeting. He even hinted that Shi Niaoren, eager to secure his cooperation, had arranged at least ten nurses to form a welcoming line.

Sikade didn't believe a word of this nonsense, of course, but he understood the message beneath it: Shi Niaoren had agreed to cooperate.

"With him on board, your matter is half accomplished." Sikade smiled. "From now on, your name will be permanently attached to his barefoot doctor program."

"Oh, no, no—I'm not chasing empty fame," Dingding protested quickly. "With the northern advance and southern expansion in full swing, we in Propaganda ought to contribute something too, shouldn't we..."

"Bullshit. Stop gilding your own face." Sikade tore a chicken leg from the clay pot chicken and gnawed at it. "Talk seriously."

"I am being serious," Dingding said. "Don't you want to build some new achievements of your own?"

This struck at the heart of Sikade's concerns. Since the Nanyang Company's establishment, "colonization" truly had nothing to do with him anymore. As for trade, overseas commerce had entered a phase of stable but slowing growth, nowhere near the explosive rates of earlier years. Mainland trade had actually declined due to the Northern Expedition.

Trade remained a critical growth driver for the Senate's economy, a stabilizing force. How to "maintain growth" had become Sikade's greatest preoccupation.

Originally, as the Senate's largest import-export trader, he hadn't concerned himself with distribution—once goods were sold, mission accomplished; how to sell them was the channels' business. But with export growth flagging, getting channels to move product faster had become his problem. Otherwise, he would never have considered "product placement."

"Achievements must certainly be made. Product placement is my trial run. If the response is favorable, I'll consider further investment." Sikade immediately assumed a posture of "it depends on your performance."

"Rest assured about the advertising. Though I'm not in arts or advertising myself, I have some talented people in reserve." Dingding thumped his chest confidently. "But I do have a few requests."

His demand was straightforward: Sikade would determine what products to advertise, but Propaganda would decide how to integrate them.

"Colonial Trade just needs to play the coal boss—the money man. Absolutely no meddling in screenwriting or directing," Dingding said.

"Don't worry. I can't be bothered to interfere with that little artistic form of yours." Sikade winked. "Wait until you have management rights to Linlaiwood, then we'll discuss specific collaboration projects."

"You really do have it all figured out." Dingding laughed. "Rest assured, when the time comes, I'll definitely help push your people..."

Seeing the atmosphere was harmonious, Dingding turned to the main topic: "The cooperation arrangement with the military and Livelihood Ministry works as follows: they select key areas—Zhaoqing, Chaozhou, Nanning, Wuzhou—places with military camps or quarantine facilities. Using existing barracks, they'll establish classrooms and dormitories equipped with guards and logistics personnel. I'll dispatch several naturalized-citizen cadres stationed under the cover of *Lingao Times* correspondents to handle daily operations. The first phase focuses on barefoot doctor training—teachers and materials provided by Shi Niaoren. Later, once we've gathered enough arts workers, we'll conduct arts production training with our own teachers and materials. Simultaneously, they'll serve as overseas correspondents for *Lingao Times*, reporting on how various stations faithfully execute Senate missions and save the suffering masses."

Dingding raised his glass to Sikade again and continued in a lower voice: "Actually, this part requires minimal additional effort or cost. Almost all overseas stations already have quarantine camps with existing literacy teachers we can fully utilize. Of course, their level is too low for 'international high schools.' So my positioning is study-abroad 'preparatory'—those willing to study in Lingao first learn Mandarin, Pinyin, and get accustomed to reading and using simplified characters. Any naturalized citizen with a junior primary education can handle these three subjects. Doesn't Hu Qingbai complain about having too many junior primary teachers? Doesn't he lack enough schools to absorb them all? We'll help absorb some."

Sikade listened to Dingding's endless stream of ideas and laughed. "You've certainly got plenty of schemes! Truly a cultured man! I understand exporting artistic works—but why are you getting so enthusiastic about barefoot doctors with Old Shi? Sure, it counts as part of the international student plan, but overall, the Health sector gains more, doesn't it?"

"Of course they gain more, but I don't come away empty-handed either. What I want is really just a name—exactly as you said earlier. Originally, what did their 'Simplified General Practitioner Training Plan' have to do with me? With this arrangement, I'm now on record for this initiative. Don't underestimate this 'name.' For those of us in propaganda, frankly speaking, what we want is 'influence.' Invisible and intangible, yet tremendously useful in reality."

"Ah, so that's your game. Hahaha." Sikade laughed and poured him more brandy. "Another drink!"

Dingding, influenced by his wife's habits, preferred hard liquor with ice or soda—the only way he could handle it. He filled his glass with natural soda water, added a slice of lemon, then took a leisurely gulp.

With the wine's momentum, his enthusiasm rose. He began expounding:

"Old Si, do you think putting on a few puppet shows and telling some storytelling segments can peacefully transform the Ming people? How could it be that easy? Instilling any concept in someone—doesn't matter what concept—requires proceeding in three steps. First step: gain trust. Make them believe you, or at least lower their guard. In the old timeline, it was rent and interest reduction; we use Heaven and Earth Society demonstration households—all serving the same purpose. Second step: integrate into life. You have to make them unable to do without you. Those American movies and TV dramas were initially given free to China—just broadcast them. Get you wanting to watch, loving to watch, making it part of your life. Third step is instilling concepts. Subtly and repeatedly drumming the same ideas into you, approaching from different angles for years, until it becomes your own belief. Conquest by force cannot last, but cultural conquest—that's forever."

None of this was fresh knowledge to Sikade. He came from a foreign trade background; this routine was all too clear to him. When a country's cultural exports were strong, its products' popularity in international markets would also rise. The two were complementary.

But Dingding was enjoying himself, so Sikade didn't interrupt—just refilled his glass. The two clinked cups.

Dingding drank and grew even more animated: "If the army simply steamrolled over, we could do whatever we wanted. But we can't swallow it all in one bite, can we? What builds trust in Ming? Delivering medicine! With that opening, our pharmaceuticals can penetrate the Ming market. Then come various other goods, including cultural products. Finally, the concepts we want to instill: 'Australia-Song good, Ming bad.' The remaining conclusions—let Ming's people reach them on their own under this framework."

Then he rambled on for over an hour about "artistic conquest" and "cultural governance" concepts.

Sikade adopted an expression of utmost admiration: "Director Ding, Old Ding... I think you should be the next term's Secretary of State."

The two continued drinking while exchanging commercial flattery. When the atmosphere felt right, Sikade spoke:

"Chief Editor Ding! I have a small favor to ask." He pulled several papers from his pocket. "Regarding current commercial enterprise management issues, we... Colonial Trade has conducted some research. This falls within our professional purview, after all—we do manage commerce. Please provide some guidance."

"Certainly, certainly." Dingding accepted the papers and unfolded them—they were several articles. He scanned the titles:

*Dabo Shipping: Sailing Toward the Future*

*The Predicament of Leizhou Sugar Industry*

*Looking at Private Capital's Role Through Hangzhou Station's Japan Trade*

*Can the Guangzhou Grand World Model Be Replicated*

*Research on Runshitang's Business Model*

Without reading the content, Dingding already sensed a common thread. If these articles' subjects shared anything, it was that most were enterprises started by overseas stations rather than directly invested and controlled by the Planning Commission. To draw an analogy, perhaps similar to regional state-owned enterprises. He casually picked up one and flipped through. The content was nothing but old-timeline institutional rigidity causes, plus warning signs emerging in this timeline, arguing that these state enterprises were developing—or would develop—large-enterprise diseases.

"Old Si, is this pure theoretical analysis? Or is there something specific behind it?" Dingding asked cautiously.

He had already vaguely guessed Sikade's thinking. He wanted to use these articles to expand overseas stations' authority—allowing them to use local capital to establish joint ventures. The Nanyang Company had carved out such vast territory; how could Colonial Trade not be jealous? Naturally, certain domains had to be reclaimed. Southeast Asia wasn't convenient to openly interfere in, but the mainland was another matter entirely.

Sikade merely smiled without speaking. The smile carried a hint of forced awkwardness. After a moment, he said: "Just consider it some theoretical exploration by our department. Summarizing experience."

"Old Si, I'll take these materials, make some edits, and publish them serially in *Morning Star*. I'll pick one or two for *Lingao Times* and space the timing out to avoid creating bad impressions." Dingding smiled and tucked all the documents into his briefcase.
