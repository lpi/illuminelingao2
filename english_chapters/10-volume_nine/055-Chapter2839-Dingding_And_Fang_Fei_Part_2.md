# Chapter 2839 Dingding and Fang Fei (Part 2)

This question immediately stumped Dingding. The 1634 organizational restructuring had eliminated the "overseas station" institution. Hangzhou Station and similar behind-enemy-lines units came under the External Intelligence Bureau's jurisdiction. But Jeju Island, Kaohsiung, and Qimu Island, which had already received the Senate's blessings, were administratively assigned to Hainan Greater Region. In practice, being so far from the emperor, they were actually closer to Hangzhou Station and Qimu Island and Shengjing Station, while Hainan Greater Region's various documents never proactively mentioned these two places. There was a subtle trend toward becoming French overseas departments.

"What do you mean?" Dingding still couldn't grasp Fang Fei's point. What he hated most was the management art of state enterprise leaders speaking half-sentences and making people guess. He never expected Fang Fei, this bushy-browed showgirl mommy, to also enjoy this game.

Of course, Fang Fei couldn't see Dingding's real thoughts. He silently finished his coffee—putting on a little show—before continuing.

"About half of these more complex matters are actually stuck at Jeju Island, Kaohsiung, and Qimu Island. I suspect that's why these departments are coming to us for coordination. I believe if we send telegrams one by one, we can definitely work it all out. But that's too inefficient. We need them to send people to interface and cooperate, to do the ground-level work for us. Of course, if we could send people to take positions inside their organizations, that would be even better. But there's definitely no time for that now."

"So you're saying we should ask Qian Shuiting to help coordinate?"

Fang Fei set down the coffee cup. Seeing Dingding's still confused expression, he felt a twinge of pearls cast before swine. Places that Qian Shuiting himself didn't want to manage—if you went begging him to help coordinate, how could that possibly work out? If it could, people would've gone directly to Qian Shuiting. If Dingding showed up in Qian Shuiting's office tomorrow, it'd probably be worse than sending telegrams himself.

"Qian Shuiting doesn't necessarily have more influence over these places than you..."

"I get it—you mean we need to find someone higher up!" Dingding slapped Fang Fei's thigh, pointing at the ceiling. "Right?"

"Yes and no." Fang Fei actually didn't have a complete answer to this question himself. But Dingding's Cultural Infiltration project had become Cultural Propaganda's flagship project—all prosper together. So he had to come offer strategies.

"Stop being so mysterious. Spit it out." Dingding was getting impatient, raising his hand for another slap.

"Don't!" Fang Fei quickly grabbed his still-descending palm. "Slap your own leg."

"Alright, alright, just tell me."

Fang Fei thought for a moment: "Our Cultural Propaganda sector is just a second-tier department in the Council of State system. We can't shoulder a project this big. By protocol, Old Hu should be our project team leader. But..."

He left the "but" unfinished, but Dingding understood his meaning. Hu Qingbai actually cared about his education work. He took a laissez-faire approach to research and propaganda—just nominally serving as administrative head. Actual matters were decided by the second-tier department heads.

So expecting Hu Qingbai to step up was unrealistic. In a sense, he was also someone Dingding needed to "coordinate" with.

The project team leader had to be someone at "Minister" level, or though not currently a Minister, a Senator who'd previously held such positions.

Counting on fingers, there weren't more than a dozen such people.

"What if they're unwilling?"

"They actually have no reason to be unwilling. The so-called project leadership is basically nominal. Borrow a name and hang it up." Fang Fei said. "If Director Wen hadn't gone to Guangzhou, I think he'd be quite suitable."

"But isn't Director Wen in Guangzhou even more suitable? This is our Mainland Infiltration Plan after all."

"He's in Guangzhou managing the Two Guangs. It's hard for him to exert influence on Council of State matters here." Fang Fei reminded him. "Others can all be considered. The downside is they might not be willing to stand up for us now."

"So that means Ma Qianzhu won't work either."

"That depends on his mood." Fang Fei said. "I'm more optimistic about Comrade Wu De. His current position is very important, but he can't hold it forever. If he can add some achievements, next General Congress there's potential for a push at Council of State Premier or Senate Chairman."

"With him as team leader, things would work out." Dingding nodded repeatedly. "Or Minister Cheng would work too."

These two were both "gods of wealth." Pulling in either would benefit the whole project.

"Cheng Dong is unlikely. He doesn't like getting involved in other affairs."

"Your suggestion really opens my mind." Dingding slapped his own thigh. "Many hands make light work! You're really our Cultural Propaganda sector's Zhuge Liang..."

"Don't—don't call me Zhuge Liang." Fang Fei waved his hands quickly. "But for a project this big, you need to get yourself a capable assistant to help."

"Aren't you suitable?"

"Count me out." Fang Fei shook his head. "Among us in Cultural Propaganda, the most suitable to be your deputy is He Fanghui. He's in Sanya now. I suggest you quickly transfer him back specifically for this..."

At the mention of He Fanghui, Dingding hesitated. Because this Senator, though not ignorant of "Culture" and "Propaganda," basically knew very little. So within Cultural Propaganda, He Fanghui rarely worked at headquarters. Most of his time was spent leading the "Touring Propaganda Team" everywhere, doing "mobile propaganda" work.

Apparently seeing Dingding's doubts, Fang Fei continued: "Though his expertise might be slightly lacking, he knows how to work with people and can get things done. You'll have plenty to deal with..."

Dingding thought about it and indeed that was true. Seeing the leader's expression relaxing, Fang Fei quickly got back on topic. He pulled out a stack of papers and handed them to Dingding: "These are some crosstalk draft scripts. Please review them and see what needs revision."

This was a project Fang Fei and Wang Tao had collaborated on: prematurely birthing crosstalk. This art form had low requirements for venue and costumes—particularly suitable for cultural promotion. So it had recently been added to the Drama Society's innovation list by Wang Tao.

The stack Fang Fei brought was all crosstalk routines. This project had been discussed before. Initially, the reference direction was traditional crosstalk like "Hawking Cloth" and "Snatching the Ma Gua." But later they discovered these crosstalk pieces had too much Qing-era and Republican-era Beijing local flavor—too traditional for Senators, too "modern" for natives. They'd need massive revision. In the end, only pieces like "Fortune-Telling" with social criticism elements were selected; other routines would be rewritten by people under Fang Fei's direction. Some "modern" crosstalk was selectively referenced.

Dingding picked up one page. The title was "Western Expedition Dream." Below the title, instead of the crosstalk script, was a text explanation: "This work is primarily performed in Mandarin, suitable for Senate-ruled territories, not suitable for Ming-occupied areas. Optimal audience: naturalized citizens with Mandarin listening and speaking ability. For performance in Jeju Island, Kaohsiung, and Two Guangs regions, versions may use Mandarin with Shandong dialect accent or Cantonese version based on audience composition. No Korean version provided."

"Pretty thorough—even promoting Mandarin is included." Dingding silently approved.

Dingding flipped through randomly. The other scripts were similar—local adaptations of existing material. But the effect was somewhat unsatisfying. Always felt like scratching an itch through clothes. Clearly these scripts needed to be written based on real life.

"And the performers?"

"Wang Tao's opinion is to select from Drama Society performers—quite a few vagrant artists there, lots of people desperate to make money. As long as you're willing to teach, they'll learn like their lives depend on it..."

"They might not need to stake their lives." Dingding was unimpressed. "Most vagrant artists recruited by Drama Society have poor education levels. C-grade diploma rate isn't even half. Too low. Even if we produce a few star performers, without creative ability, relying on others for material, they'll hit a dead end eventually."

"Yes, yes, you're absolutely right." Fang Fei nodded repeatedly. "I'll talk to Wang Tao properly!"

"Also, the large group calisthenics you said you'd prepare—need to hurry that up." Dingding suddenly remembered. "Though welcome ceremonies were held as troops came back, I'm guessing there'll most likely be some kind of victory celebration. Group calisthenics will definitely be needed then—how's the background card section training going?"

"Hu Qingbai won't approve leave time. Says it's a waste. You know how he always is..." Fang Fei was helpless.

Dingding furrowed his brow, thinking this really was troublesome. Would have to get Ma Qianzhu to coordinate again. Department leadership not even supporting internal department matters—difficult!

"This is all public sentiment," Dingding said earnestly at the Council of State regular meeting. After reporting the Cultural Strategy's interim results, he threw out this coordination organizer question: "I personally agree. In terms of professional fit, Chairman Wang commanded Operation Giant—far more complex than our little project."

Wang Luobin was quite pleased with Dingding's flattery. He did rather miss commanding large forces. But thinking about how tedious, complex, and lacking in short-term results this work was, a wave of irritation rose in his heart. Where was the fun compared to tinkering on optical rangefinders with Lin Hanlong?

"Thanks to Comrade Ding and everyone's trust. But currently I really don't have the energy. Besides my regular duties, the optical rangefinder project really can't spare me. Last week the sample was tested at the range—at 3,000 meters, error 150 meters; at 1,000 meters, error 10 meters. I'd say it already has practical value. I estimate with a few more months of effort, if we can halve the error, that'll be a force multiplier for our artillery."
