# Chapter 401 - The Question of Interests

"I don't know—" Wan Lihui wondered if that fifteen or sixteen-year-old country girl had taken a fancy to him. What would he do if Fu Bu'er proposed marrying off his daughter to him? Should he agree or refuse? Come to think of it, the Executive Committee didn't seem to have any regulations about whether one could marry a native woman. Speaking of which, this Fu Yijin wasn't bad-looking, just a bit dark-skinned—though in this timeline she was surely a virgin...

"What are you thinking about?" Fu Xi's voice interrupted Wan Lihui's wandering thoughts. "Sister Yijin was just saying you work very diligently and teach everyone a lot of things. She doesn't think you're a fraud."

"Oh, is that so." Wan Lihui felt slightly disappointed, but this indicated that his strategy had been working reasonably well. The Fu household currently trusted him quite a bit.

So he redoubled his efforts to cultivate the Fu family's domestic servants and children. Knowing they usually didn't eat well, he began saving his leftover rice after each meal, wrapping it in lotus leaves. He would wait until Fu Xi had collected the dishes before finding an opportunity to give her the rice. During rest breaks in the fields, he often shared the rations he'd brought in his backpack with everyone. Thanks to his diligent efforts to win them over, Wan Lihui's reputation in the Fu household grew daily, and everything he did went smoothly.

But Fu Bu'er's attitude toward him remained lukewarm. Although he never obstructed Wan Lihui's opinions, this effect was compelled by the transmigrators' collective intimidation—Wan Lihui wasn't confident this effect would persist after he left.

Wan Lihui thought the key was to cater to Fu Bu'er's desires. What did Fu Bu'er lack most right now? Money, naturally. The Fu household wasn't desperate for cash, but he seemed to have an almost obsessive appetite for accumulating more. Wan Lihui knew Fu Bu'er had tried growing cash crops several times and was now raising ducks, showing he had a strong desire for money. One evening while they were cooling off, Fu Bu'er had summoned the courage to ask for his help in recovering Fu Fu's military pay.

"Your Honor doesn't know—Fu Fu is my domestic servant. I raised him from a baby, provided his food and clothes. I raised him to eighteen or nineteen years old; I'm practically his father. Now he's become a soldier, yet he doesn't bring back a single wen of his monthly pay! That's one tael of silver per month! One whole tael of silver!"

Remembering Fu Bu'er's indignant expression when mentioning the silver, Wan Lihui thought this was his weak point. The results of rice cultivation wouldn't be visible until autumn. What could he help him generate income with right now?

Could he have Fu Bu'er supply vegetables and ducks to the transmigrator collective? He was already doing that—business agents from Quanfu Vegetable Trading came to the village every week with ox carts to purchase vegetables, pigs, and poultry eggs.

Wan Lihui pondered this troublesome problem all night without coming up with an answer. Whether it was planting or animal husbandry, neither could generate quick returns. He had considered helping Fu Bu'er develop a sericulture business—this was something he knew relatively well—but mulberry trees were scarce locally. If they had to wait until after planting mulberry trees before raising silkworms, the timeframe would be far too long.

To get rich quickly, commerce and industry were still the way to go. Wan Lihui arrived at the same conclusion countless predecessors had reached.

About half a month passed this way. Seeing that Fu Bu'er's second rice crop transplanting was basically complete and that he had conveyed all the key points of field management, he set off back to the farm. He planned to rest for a few days.

Upon returning to the farm, Wan Lihui first wrote reports on his client's economic situation, population, and ideological trends. He also attended a briefing on the field inspectors' guidance work. After the meeting, he went directly to General Staff Headquarters.

Originally, Wan Lihui wanted to find Ma Qianzhu, but he wasn't there. After wandering around for a while, he found someone and asked, "Who's in charge of political and ideological work?"

And so he came to the "Political Department." Wei Aiwen was in his office talking with several new soldiers, so Wan Lihui had to sit outside the door for a while. Although the door was closed, he could faintly hear a man sobbing inside. What was that guy doing? Was he physically punishing soldiers, or doing something else...

While his thoughts were running wild, the door opened and two young men wearing educational soldier insignia came out. Though their eyes were red, their faces bore a relaxed expression.

Wan Lihui walked straight into the Political Department office. Before he could even stand still, he heard someone shout:
"What squad are you from? How dare you walk in without signing the register and reporting! Don't you have any discipline!"

The speaker was a half-grown boy wearing an army uniform, staring at him with a serious expression, gesturing decisively for him to leave.

"What?!" Wan Lihui nearly went cross-eyed with anger. He'd been composting at the farm, dredging river mud in the countryside at risk of encountering bandits, transplanting rice seedlings in the fields—yet here they were, living in comfort in their offices, putting on airs like some privileged class.

"Hey, hey, this is a senior official—" Though Wei Aiwen didn't recognize Wan Lihui, he knew this person was one of the transmigrators. Seeing his expression turn hostile, he hurried over to smooth things over.

"Senior officials aren't exempt either. Non-summons entries to the Political Department office are forbidden. Those seeking an audience must register..." The boy was quite stubborn and paid no attention to Wan Lihui.

"This gentleman had an appointment with me. Please step outside for now." Wei Aiwen quickly pushed the meticulous young cadet out the door, closed it behind him, then turned around and asked:
"And you are?"

Wan Lihui saw that this person before him was only about twenty-five or twenty-six, wearing a Year-One pattern army uniform that was crisply pressed. He wore a German-style military officer's belt, and his boots were polished to a shine. Wan Lihui immediately felt a surge of distaste:
"Since this is a military restricted area, perhaps I should go out and register first."

"No need for that!" Wei Aiwen quickly said. "I'm Wei Aiwen. And you are—"

"I'm Wan Lihui from the Agricultural Committee." He sat down in a chair. "I have some business. I originally wanted to discuss it with the Supervisor, but since he's not here, I'll talk to you directly—it's still political work-related, after all."

"There should be a soldier in the army named Fu Fu..." He went on to explain the Fu household's situation and mentioned Fu Bu'er's desire to obtain the military pay. He hoped the Political Department could mediate and have Fu Fu send a portion of his pay home each month.

"Not much—just a few hundred wen would be a nice gesture..."

"That doesn't make sense at all." Wei Aiwen was dismissive. "Fu Bu'er was his master, not his father—he's not even an adoptive father. It was purely a master-slave relationship. Now that Fu Fu is our soldier, he's no longer anyone's servant. The demand to claim part of his military pay is completely unjustifiable."

"True enough. But Fu Bu'er feels quite cheated. Because he raised Fu Fu from childhood, and now that Fu Fu is serving as a soldier for us, not only has Fu Bu'er lost a laborer but he's not getting any benefit either. That seems rather inappropriate, doesn't it?"

"He should have received two hundred kilograms of rice as a settling-in allowance when Fu Fu enlisted. This landlord is really greedy!" Wei Aiwen expressed his disdain.

"Greedy for sure, but I think we should still satisfy him somewhat," Wan Lihui said. "Cultivating the other party's goodwill is very useful for the Tiandihui's expansion plan."

"Impossible. Absolutely not." Wei Aiwen shook his head repeatedly. "Whether or not a soldier sends his pay to his family is his personal freedom. We have no right to interfere."

"That's precisely why I'm asking you to do political and ideological work—you are the Political Department, aren't you..."

Wei Aiwen found this whole business distasteful. Suddenly he grew suspicious: Why was this Wan Lihui so eager to fight for the interests of Fu Bu'er, a landlord? Could he have accepted some bribe during his time in the countryside? But given that this landlord Fu was scheming to get his hands on just one tael of silver a month in military pay, he probably couldn't afford to offer much money. So it had to be—

The phrase "sexual bribery" suddenly popped into his mind. Yes, that had to be it. In ancient society women had no status; they were surely offered as gifts to build connections... Wei Aiwen's imagination began to run wild: Wan Lihui feasting in the landlord's great hall, the landlord's daughter coming out to offer wine, and then...

Thinking of this, his tone hardened: "Speaking on behalf of slave owners is definitely not the kind of political work our Political Department does."

"You!" Wan Lihui nearly jumped up, but then he realized Wei Aiwen's words were reasonable. He couldn't help softening his tone and pleading: "This matter is indeed rather unreasonable, but it would help our work."

"I don't see how it would be useful—" Wei Aiwen replied curtly.

"You don't understand the issues here!"

"Isn't he just a greedy landlord?"

"It's not that simple!"

The two exchanged words, their voices growing louder and louder. The cadet outside the door quickly opened the door and came in.

"Get out, you don't need to come in!" Wei Aiwen was afraid the cadet might do something drastic in his agitation, which would leave him holding the bag.

"Let's all calm down and not argue." Wu De's voice came from outside the door.

Wu De had come to the Army Department to coordinate labor deployment. The military was currently the most commonly used source of organized labor for the labor allocation department that Wu De managed.

"Good timing—come settle this dispute." Wei Aiwen quickly pulled him inside and explained the whole situation from start to finish.

Wan Lihui also explained the Fu household's circumstances and his own thinking.

Wu De smiled: "Little Wan, you're quite enthusiastic. But this matter is indeed tricky."

"What's tricky about it? We simply shouldn't get involved." Wei Aiwen said huffily. "To curry favor with a landlord by forcing soldiers to send their pay to slave owners? What does that make us! Lackeys for the landlord class?"

"Alright, alright, don't escalate this to a political level." Wu De pressed his hands down. "This matter isn't big or small—we'll likely encounter similar issues in the future."

The Ming Dynasty wasn't a slave society, but the system of domestic servitude was widespread. The deeper they penetrated into this society and the wider the population they encountered, the less they could avoid this issue.

"If you ask me, we should simply not recognize this servant system at all..."

"Not recognizing it would be the simplest solution. But don't forget that the immigrants are all contract slaves of the transmigrator collective—we are slave owners ourselves. Since we want to use this servant system for our own benefit, we must treat everyone equally. We can't just allow ourselves to start fires while forbidding others to light lamps."

"Fine," Wei Aiwen softened his tone, "tell me what you think should be done. But I'm opposed to this approach."

"Since we're going to recognize the servant system, then Fu Bu'er's request has its own rationale—Fu Fu is his domestic servant. Having him serve as a soldier while extracting his military pay as income is essentially the same as having Fu Fu work for him for free, exploiting his labor."

"That can't be the same thing though. Being a soldier carries high risk—he could be maimed or killed at any moment. That's not the same as farming and doing odd jobs."

"Perhaps this could be considered a form of high-risk, high-reward. It's just that the reward is taken by his master, which reduces him to the status of livestock or a tool. Now that Fu Fu is refusing to send his pay back, it shows he's already developed a consciousness of resistance—he's no longer passively accepting his fate."

"How should we handle this?"

"If we ignore it, Fu Bu'er naturally can't do anything about it—although he's dissatisfied, it won't necessarily affect the Tiandihui's expansion..."

Wan Lihui was about to raise an objection, but Wu De cut him off:

"Little Wan, your intentions are good, but this is more like icing on the cake than sending coal in the snow. If you can help Fu Bu'er get Fu Fu's military pay, he'll naturally trust you even more, and future work will be easier. But if you simply ignore him, he won't suddenly develop a dislike for us or let it affect the Tiandihui's expansion—he can still tell the difference between the big picture and minor grievances."

"There's a lot of opposition in the village, and there are many rumors circulating..."

"Even if you help him get Fu Fu's military pay, it won't eliminate the rumors, will it? You want to use this matter to increase Fu Bu'er's trust in you—a fine idea, but you need to think more comprehensively." Wu De lit a cigarette. "If the Political Department intervenes to convince Fu Fu, naturally it can be done. But what will Fu Fu think? He'll definitely feel we're siding with the rich—after all, he's the one sweating and bleeding, not Fu Bu'er. Moreover, they have a master-servant relationship. Fu Bu'er feels he has shown Fu Fu the grace of raising him, but Fu Fu might feel he was mistreated and exploited since childhood and harbors deep resentment."

"Ah, right—" Wan Lihui realized he hadn't thought of that.

"As they say, where you sit determines who you speak for. Landlords like Fu Bu'er, we need to win over; the poor people like Fu Fu are our base of support."

"You mean don't offend either side..."

"Heh, what I mean is you don't need to pay any attention to Fu Bu'er at all." Wu De smiled. "I've already explained the reasoning—the benefits Fu Bu'er gets from us far outweigh that bit of military pay. Just pretend you didn't hear him. As for how to handle this in the future, we'll come up with a plan."

"I understand." Wan Lihui nodded and left.

This matter also reminded Wu De that similar problems would likely become more and more frequent in the future. Since they had chosen to carry this historical burden for the time being, they needed to find a reasonable solution.

"Little Wei, conduct a survey: How many soldiers in the military currently have servant status? What are their situations—are they runaways, or were they sent by their masters? I suspect there are quite a few people like Fu Fu among the conscripts from the various villages."

"We have the political vetting forms. I'll have the Computer Center run the statistics immediately." To conserve the lifespan of computer components, the number of computers allocated to each department had been greatly reduced. Except for certain departments and a few individuals' offices, each department had its own Computer Center to centrally process various tasks.

The Computer Center quickly sent back a reply. According to the political vetting forms, more than thirty soldiers were registered as servants of various Lingao households. Those registered as runaways from servitude were even more numerous—three or four hundred.

"The material in the vetting forms may not fully reflect the situation. Some people may have concealed their history. You should have the squad leaders investigate more carefully—just don't make it too formal and frighten people."

After giving his instructions, he went to find Ma Qianzhu and discussed the issue with him, hoping to come up with a solution for similar problems.

"Ah De, this is indeed something we need to think about," Ma Qianzhu said. "As we interact more with the natives of this timeline, we must have formal documentation to regulate behavior. Besides the servant issue you mentioned, there's also the matter of adoption, taking on apprentices—and some people have also asked the Executive Committee what procedures are needed to marry a native wife."

In fact, some people had asked whether they could buy a personal servant for themselves—the exploits of Chang Shide in Leizhou had spread throughout both banks of the Wenlan River, inspiring envy among the single men. Since they couldn't wait for the state to distribute women, wouldn't it be fine to buy one themselves? Suddenly, buying servant girls had become the hottest topic of conversation.

Wu De's face reddened slightly. First Rain in his own household was still in a state of "undefined status," continuing under the title of "Commune Secretary."

"Let's just draft a law then—'Native Relations Act'? Use legal provisions to establish all kinds of relationships, rights and obligations with natives, and how to handle disputes when they arise. We can have the Justice Office handle it."

"Just leave it to Ma Jia—doesn't he like drafting legal provisions? That Law Club of his, tsk tsk."

"There's no ready-made book to copy from for this law. We should first draft a guiding document."

How to provide guidance? Ma Qianzhu thought about the myriad aspects of relationships with natives. It wasn't easy to sort them out at the moment. He had someone summon Ma Jia for consultation—he spent most of his time at the farm's coffee house these days, where the Law Club's jurists used it as their office.

After hearing their situation briefing, Ma Jia said: "It would be difficult to quickly produce a formal codified law. I think for now we should use a case-based approach. Cases are flexible to use and can be modified and updated at any time."

They would list all the various interactions with natives that the transmigrator collective had encountered so far, then write out the specific handling methods and reference opinions for each case, followed by the Executive Committee's guiding opinions. This way, one merely needed to look up cases to find answers. It would be much clearer and simpler than obscure legal provisions.

"Take the current servant issue in the military," Wu De said, explaining today's events. "Cases like this are very typical: a master sends his servant to serve as a soldier, yet still wants to take his military pay. Whose side should we take? After investigation, there are more than thirty people with local servant status in the military, and landlords who think like Fu Bu'er are surely not isolated cases."
