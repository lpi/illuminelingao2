# Chapter 85 - Construction Materials

Just as the various professional groups of the Executive Committee were arguing over labor priority, Xiao Zishan received another call from Ran Yao: Li people captives were found during the interrogation process.

"Really?" Xiao Zishan was surprised. In this place of Hainan Island, the Li ethnic group has always been a very powerful force. Opening the county annals of various counties, "Li Situation" always occupies a separate chapter. Since the Yuan Dynasty, there was almost no year when the Li people did not launch riots. The conflict between Han and Li was quite fierce. Defense against Li has always been an important task for local governments. Because of the resistance of the Li people, Han immigrants have never been able to penetrate into the core area of Hainan Island. For transmigrators to develop and grow in Hainan, they must be extremely cautious on the Li issue.

"What's the situation?"

"According to them, they were conscripted by the county as archers and crossbowmen, totally thirty came, and now we caught eight." Ran Yao said on the phone, "Also tell you something, remember that family? The one accidentally involved—"

"Remember, isn't that woman from a police background? Assigned to you for interrogation."

"She is Li, and her ancestral home is Hainan. Very neat, right? I think this relationship can be utilized."

"I remember she speaks Sichuan-Mandarin? Many ethnic minorities now are full of water (not authentic). Besides, she hasn't lived locally for a long time, what can she know."

"No, she knows a lot about her own ethnic group. Several Li captives are now prostrating themselves in admiration of her," Ran Yao's laughter came from the Xiaolingtong (PHS), "You see, talents sometimes appear inadvertently."

Guo Yi had almost finished screening here: the vast majority were farmers—small landlords often participated in labor themselves. A few counted as craftsmen, but actually were also semi-farmers semi-workers, burning some pottery or acting as masons repairing and building houses for others during slack farming seasons. The one with slightly some skill was a rough carpenter, a semi-old man. Only one was literate, that was Zhang Xingjiao. He was called out separately to learn Mandarin with Xiong Buyou, becoming the clerk of the entire labor team, responsible for recording work points and such things.

Wu De pulled the craftsmen out separately to form a team. The others, except for more than twenty wounded, were all divided into five labor teams, with the earliest five captives as team leaders. When organizing groups, based on interrogation records, he mixed Lingao natives, Fujian Shegeng people (migrant farmers), and immigrants from various places all up, still playing that set of mutual restraint—anyway, you can't unite. Lin Xing and the others now all became team leaders, forgetting their status as semi-captives and semi-slaves, each feeling quite happy. Without waiting for Wu De's instructions, they made themselves rattan sticks, ready to urge the new poor wretches diligently.

Strict hierarchical relationships, absolute power between superiors and subordinates, and benefits obtained through power, these things are extremely tempting in human groups. Wu De, who had worked in the army and judicial organs for many years, knew this well. So he deliberately deepened these things. Five team leaders were each issued an ugly rattan safety helmet—this was an unsuccessful trial product of the Industrial Committee, originally intended to be burned as firewood, but Wu De asked for all these hats back, distinguishing the status of captives with obvious markers like having a hat or no hat.

Because of the urgent need of the project, all labor teams were assigned to the Architecture Team to produce building materials: bricks.

Modern architecture has gradually shifted from bricks and tiles to using reinforced concrete, but fired clay bricks are still the most widely used economical material. The Architecture Engineering Group naturally wouldn't give up either.

According to the news from the reconnaissance team, they found a brick and tile field three kilometers away from Bairen Beach. This was a typical traditional brick and tile field. There were three earthen round kilns. Although the workers had all run away, the things inside were still there: fired bricks and tiles, air-dried brick adobe, and a lot of "cooked earth" (prepared clay).

The process of firing bricks and tiles is quite cumbersome. First, raw earth must be mined—that is, clay without organic matter. The raw earth is dried in the sun, crushed, added with water, then repeatedly crushed and treaded to make cooked earth, then made into brick adobe. Brick adobe cannot be put directly into the kiln for firing. If there is too much moisture, it will crack and deform directly in the kiln, so it has to be air-dried for ten days to half a month. During air-drying, it cannot see the sun, cannot have strong wind, and cannot encounter cold, so under normal circumstances, bricks and tiles cannot be fired in winter. Only air-dried brick adobe can be put into the kiln for firing.

If letting transmigrators make and fire bricks themselves, it's hard to imagine the problem of production efficiency. However, transmigrators had a combined brick-making machine driven by a locomobile. The efficiency of making brick adobe only lay in how much raw earth they could mine.

Mei Wan felt the production efficiency of the earthen round kiln was too low, and loading the kiln required skilled old masters to do it, not something green hands like them reading instructions could do. Fortunately, there were a large number of ready-made bricks available here, so construction of a 16-chamber Hoffman kiln (Ring Kiln) was started.

The Hoffman kiln is a kind of "foreign kiln". Of course, compared to more advanced modern brick kilns like tunnel kilns, it is already very backward, but in this space-time, it is definitely an advanced thing.

It is a continuous production kiln that can load adobe, discharge bricks, and clean simultaneously. The kiln consists of many interconnected small chambers, like a circular tunnel. There are many kiln doors around, and all flues are connected to the main flue in the center of the kiln. Fuel is added from the feeding holes on the top of the kiln. When the Hoffman kiln works, it is divided into four working zones: drying, preheating, calcining, and cooling. In a 16-chamber kiln, while the first chamber is discharging bricks, the sixteenth chamber is already being cleaned, the fifteenth chamber is loading adobe at the same time, then the second chamber can deliberately discharge bricks, the first chamber performs cleaning, and the sixteenth chamber can load adobe. Once ignited, it can produce continuously for twenty-four hours without interruption. It is beyond the reach of traditional kilns in terms of work efficiency and thermal energy utilization. An ordinary Hoffman kiln can produce more than 50 million bricks and tiles a year.

In order not to waste time, while installing machinery and building the Hoffman kiln, Mei Wan decided to fire those already air-dried brick and tile adobes first. However, loading brick adobes into the earthen kiln is a technical job. Neither transmigrators nor laborers had ever done it. News was sent back to the Executive Committee. Luo Duo of the Intelligence and Data Group once again played his function as a two-legged dictionary, quickly finding an electronic version of a booklet "Native Methods of Brick and Tile Making" published in 1958 from the computer hard drive. In less than an hour, this printed small book was rushed to the kiln. The laborers were surprised to see this "pirate craftsman" using a book to guide them how to load the kiln—this was a secret only old masters knew!

There was a large area of thatch grass near the brick kiln. Mei Wan asked the laborers who had worked odd jobs in the brick kiln in the past and learned that this was specially planted as fuel. Earth kilns can only fire well with such "soft firewood". Hard firewood has too strong a fire power and the fire head is not easy to control. These fuels were naturally utilized unceremoniously by the transmigrators.

When the earthen kiln was firing bricks, Mei Wan commanded the labor team to constantly cut grass and dig earth. Grass bundles and earth piles were piled high. Some captives felt that the pirates mostly wanted to work them to death—so much earth, couldn't finish using even without eating or sleeping.

When the locomobile was adjusted, puffing black smoke, the flywheel rotating, driving the combined brick-making machine to run, the captives only saw piles of cooked earth being poured into that big steel mouth. Many iron parts dazzled up and down roaring, and then saw flat earth adobe being neatly cut into whole boards of brick adobe as if by magic! Even the most skilled brick-making master couldn't do it so fast! Everyone was dumbfounded—pirates know everything! And the speed at which they build things is simply not something mortal power can achieve. Some people simply knelt in fear before the roaring machine and kowtowed repeatedly.

"Kowtowing for what, go transport materials quickly!" Mei Wan roared at the dazed Lin Xing.

"Understood! Chief." Don't know which person with nothing to do after eating taught him this address. He now calls transmigrators Chief upon seeing them.

"Work! Work!" He waved the stick vigorously, "Go transport earth, hurry up, those moving slow will be thrown into that iron mouth!"

This threat was much more effective than his stick. Every captive developed a superstitious terror of this machine, and everyone worked very hard, afraid that if they worked slowly, they would really be thrown into the machine mouth—this kind of thing probably needs living people as sacrifices, right?

The produced brick adobes were pulled to the stockyard by handcarts. The original air-drying sheds were emptied, just right for stacking these newly made brick adobes. All bricks were manufactured according to the past standard 85 bricks.

Obviously, the machine's production speed greatly exceeded this era. Before nightfall, the cooked earth prepared by Lingao brick-burning craftsmen for several months was exhausted, and the machine had to stop temporarily.

To build the Hoffman kiln, another task for Mei Wan was to produce cement. For him, cement was a matter of making a phone call to have someone deliver goods. Even the cement used after D-Day was brought from the original space-time. Now starting to manufacture from scratch, he had completely no concept. Mei Wan knew there was such a thing as indigenous cement in this world, but how to make it, and what performance it would have after making it, was unclear.

In modern society, the cement industry has become a highly specialized, mechanized large-scale production, involving many special large-scale dedicated equipment, such as crushers, rotary kilns, ball mills, etc. Copying such large equipment is too extravagant for transmigrators. Even if ready-made equipment is bought for installation, such giant equipment is not something their ability can handle.
