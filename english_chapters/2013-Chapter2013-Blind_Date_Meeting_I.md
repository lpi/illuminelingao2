# Chapter 2013 - Blind Date Meeting (I)

Although disabled naturalized citizens with disability above Grade 4, life unable to self-care, were issued special nursing fee by Civil Affairs Mouth, plus their disability subsidy etc., at least could ensure income not lower than average wage level of naturalized staff. Some with merit award even higher. But to their marriage objects, "Life Unable Self Care" these six words were enough to make them stop steps.

Cadres on scene "Mobilized" repeatedly. Especially emphasized their income level and enjoyed welfare: Husband and wife need not go out working can enjoy same living standard as most naturalized staff. Also extra care in welfare. Finally totally another batch of people selected these disabled staff. Mostly were self condition relatively poor: Age biased big, having child to raise or having deficiency in appearance...

Finally this part of people still remained quite a few. Du Yibin knew actual ability of this blind date just stopped here. Luckily disabled personnel above Grade 4 were not too many. So problem was not that obvious.

"Single Women" picking suitable objects registered at cadre place. Immediately packed luggage concentrating to a separate dormitory living—Within few days. Civil Affairs Department would arrange boat ticket for them. Letting them go to Lingao. Although Du Yibin and Wang Jun mouth said if they regretted at most wasting a boat ticket. But actually once they arrived Lingao they would absolutely not leave again. Letting them leave all won't leave.

As for those not picking. Then stayed in Shelter waiting for next blind date. Although Mao Xiuyu hinted could use some "Means" to let them choose. But Du Yibin still felt somewhat unbearable. Considered a bit decided letting them choose later.

"Opening blind date meeting tomorrow. Want or not asking Chief Du let them participate too?" Lu Cheng seeing still remaining thirty plus people. These people face full of disappointment when leaving. Heart inevitably somewhat unbearable.

Lu Weijia felt indifferent. Mao Xiuyu shook head repeatedly: "Cannot do. Cannot do." He explained: "They remaining. Is unwilling to choose disabled naturalized staff; If letting them participate blind date meeting. Marrying those limb healthy naturalized staff. What those selecting disabled people in front will think? Can this matter still be held later?"

Two people listened felt reasonable. Mao Xiuyu continued suggesting best isolating those single women far away. Regardless preparing to marry or not picking suitable ones. Even message cannot leak. Avoid knowing students blind date activity. Stimulating them.

"Also have to be so." Lu Weijia nodded.

"We separate checking to handle."

Du Yibin and Wang Jun's blind date grand meeting held grandly in Shelter next day. Naturalized staff coming to participate blind date had one hundred people. All dispatched to Guangzhou working and currently on business trip in Guangzhou. Profession five flower eight doors. From cadre, worker, police, soldier... Having all expected.

When selecting male side. Wang Jun and Du Yibin also spent some thought. Marrying wife difficult was old big difficulty problem among naturalized staff. This not only because of disparaging male female ratio also attributed to female economic status promotion. After large batch of female naturalized citizens had own income. Marriage became not so urgent. Their requirement to choosing spouse also different.

In this way. On Lingao marriage market. Those relatively weak male naturalized staff became choosing spouse difficult. First they originally age biased big. Belonging to Old Bachelor. Lacking attraction in front of women; Second because of culture, ability relation. Dwelling at bottom layer in Senate naturalized citizen system. Engaging all simple physical labor. Not only income biased low. Also no promotion prospect. Female naturalized staff with slightly some vision all looked down.

Since couldn't find within system. They could only put vision to non-naturalized masses—Unevenly naturalized citizen group demonstration effect of Lingao too powerful. Single male too many. Vision of waiting to marry women in native common people originally limited in quantity also not low. Result this batch of naturalized staff forty upwards could only rely on buying spring to solve physiological need.

Selling soul one moment with "Yellow Tickets" although could solve physiological need. But to emotional comfort a person needed had no help. No family. No child. Shadow of lonely old life long always shrouded on their heads.

This Continent Strategy. This batch of relatively bottom layer naturalized "Old Staff" also dispatched successively. Although their ability couldn't competent various level leadership positions. But Guangdong also needed large amount of grassroots clerk personnel and workers—At least they could write could calculate. Speaking passable Common Speech. Conveniently coming to Guangdong where gender ratio not that unbalanced to solve personal problem.

Wang Jun selected naturalized staff serving Senate seniority over three years, age over thirty five full years among this batch of people. Also剔ed out some obviously unsuitable ones. Finally formed a one hundred people list.

Early morning. These "Older Leftover Men" notified to "Blind Date" gathered to City Government according to notice. Liu Xiang for expressing support to this matter. Specially arranged several barbers shaving hair trimming face for them on scene. Also issued a set of new clothes to every staff participating blind date. Deputy Chief Wang Sangou of General Affairs Section of City Government. Wearing a brand new uniform. Joy and Happiness overflowing shuttling among a group of bachelor men waiting for haircut shaving face. From time to time happily scolded them a few sentences.

"Beard shave cleaner. Looking younger!"

"Why your face not wash well. Dark eyebrow stove eye. Where has woman looking upon you!"

"Going blind date still frowning face. Not want having son?!"

...

Bachelors also Joy and Happiness overflowing. Although previously greeted with them. Blind dating were all rescued prostitutes. But to old bachelors. Able to have wife was accident joy. To wife background didn't mind. To scolding words of Wang Sangou also returned color:

"Chief Wang. You are also Old Bachelor. Why not go blind date?"

"You Old Virtue High Weight Heavy. Also Chief. Going blind date isn't it Hand Arrive Capture Come."

"Chief Wang. You are old senior of our Bachelor World. Isn't this finding a wife self also bearing a son?"

"You just spare Chief Wang. He a handle of age. Heart has Strength no."

"Didn't you hear Old Stronger Benefit Strong? Zhou Wen Wang eighty still had son."

"Taking umbrella as hunting gun. Yet beat dead fox. You say is such a matter?"

...

Wang Sangou brows open eyes smile. Not caring bachelors' teasing a bit. Shook head said: "I this handle of age. Still have how many years living head? Even if able to beat fox also not doing—Dragging down other good woman. You are all still young. Marrying a wife forming a family. Days passing more having flavor. This all relying on blessing of Senate!"

Joy and Happiness overflowing in yard. Wang Jun preparing to host blind date ceremony face full of smile. Tossed for so long. Finally made out such a bit result. Although self was for brushing performance. But everyone's joy also infected him.

Just following happy. Seeing Du Yibin also face full of joy color coming. Beside him besides guard and secretary. Also taking an old man. Wearing Dongpo Scarf. Wearing Straight Hem. Manner bearing looking like an old pedant. Face color dark gloomy. A face of unhappy expression. Wang Jun wondered: This is which one?

"This is Mr. Song... Song Yingsheng..." Du Yibin said. Fearing Wang Jun didn't know he was what person. Supplemented again. "Just Song Yingxing his brother."

Song Yingsheng face full of anger. Since captured in Enping. Repeatedly begging death cannot. He discovered this Senator Du "One Toward Emotion Deep" to self. Spelled life wanting to persuade self "Surrender Song." [Pun: Surrender to Song Dynasty / Surrender Song Yingsheng]. Arriving Guangzhou. Every seeing a Senator. Would specially mention a sentence: "This is Song Yingxing his brother."

He truly wondered. From attitude of this Senator Du and other Senators to self. Obviously Australians valued Third Brother Yingxing very much. But Third Brother was just an unclassed instructor in Fenyi County School. Self also just a Magistrate. Second Brother Song Yingding already passed away. If saying Father. Was an Old Xiucai forty years not passing exam. And also passed away few years ago. Grandfather even passed away in youth. Most prominent in family was only Great Grandfather Song Jing who entered Cabinet once—He left world almost hundred years.

Own family in Jiangxi although barely could count "Big Clan." But not counted wealthy. Song Yingsheng wanted breaking head also couldn't think out why Hair Thieves interested in Third Brother like this.

Persuading surrender in Enping not counted. This time this Hair Thief Magistrate returned Guangzhou. Also insisted bringing him. Saying wanted to call him "Open Eye." Arriving Guangzhou. Although didn't see rumored Australian "Big Engaging Earth Wood" "Touching Stone Becoming Gold." But Guangzhou streets face appearance completely new. Not only side shops all demolished. Streets also repaired. Everywhere clearing silt digging ditch.

Song Yingsheng was Magistrate background. Although Enping wasn't a big place. Also knew doing these things all laboring strength wasting spirit. Eating strength not pleasing efforts things. Especially this side shop. Can be called stubborn disease.

Australians entering city these days. Actually did some practical things. Good things! This made his view to Australian better much.

Speaking truth. To Du Yibin administration in Enping. He mostly still affirmed. Although inside quite many "Disapproving" points. Feeling Australian inevitably too trivial. "Non Ruling World Material." Just relying on gun cannon military force could pass unobstructed.

Arriving Guangzhou. Just realized this administrative trivial actually had huge benefit—Especially in big city like Guangzhou. Coming Guangzhou these days. He was brought coming brought going by Senator Du. Walked quite a few places. Deeply felt market street face here greatly different from past. Not only street neat clean. Even pedestrian face on street also different from past. So his attitude to Senator Du. Also slightly softened some.

This time called to participate what "Blind Date Meeting." Song Yingsheng heart was rejecting. However since reduced to prisoner below stairs. Also couldn't not winding curve seeking wholeness. Such matter irrelevant to fame integrity. Going participating once also no harm. Moreover this Senator Du also said. Not asking him do anything. Willing help then help. Not willing. Staying aside watching bustle is fine. Chief said to this degree. Song Yingsheng also tacitly accepted.
