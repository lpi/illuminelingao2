# Chapter 136: New Blood

After completing the full "Purification" process, they were housed in quarantine station dormitories. Dorms were gender-segregated—each with twenty-plus beds. Novelty: beds were double-bunked. Top sleepers climbed up. But everyone had individual beds—clean straw mattresses—plus a thin felt blanket. For children who'd been sleeping rough for months, this was practically heaven.

Also distributed: large ceramic cups, washcloths—towels required knitting machines not yet producible. Toothbrushes, however, entered production quickly: wooden-handled, horse-hair bristles, hand-drilled and hand-bundled. Industrial Department was amazed—local women, from just drawings and requirements, using simplest hand tools, made toothbrushes. Output was low—only twenty daily.

As for indispensable rinse cups and eating bowls—unfortunately, brought supplies were limited. Fragile glazed ceramics had to suffice. Lacking stainless steel spoons—wooden-turned ones worked. These simplest daily goods couldn't be self-supplied due to material shortages.

The fierce maidservant assigned beds—younger ones below, older ones above. Many rules: could go outside, but only to the doorway clearing. No visiting neighboring dorms. Bowls and cups were personal—no sharing. Everything placed on shelves in order... Everyone choked—so many rules here.

Discipline violators had the most effective punishment: meal skipping.

"Mealtime!" As bells clanged outside, someone announced. Large lidded tin buckets delivered steaming food. First meal: thick fish cake congee—minced fish cakes with vegetables. Nutritionally complete. Everyone ate satisfactorily—but no seconds. Wu Nanhai feared overeating would upset stomachs. However, three meals daily from the start—to boost nutrition. Medical Group knew: many epidemic diseases correlated with malnutrition.

During this 40-day quarantine observation, they couldn't be idle—transmigrators weren't charity workers. Salt Field Village's night school sent two star graduates for literacy and Mandarin teaching. Everyone received slate boards and chalk. Mornings: study. Afternoons: work. Bopu's rattan and wood factory sent simple handwork: processing rattan, weaving rattan ware, splitting bamboo, sanding wood boards. Children showing dexterity were recorded—guiding future training. Pre-dinner: free time for games. Post-dinner: cleaning, bathing, then mandatory sleep—transmigrators didn't provide dorm lighting. But every nightfall, many children gathered at chain-link fences—watching flickering lights in the harbor's red buildings.

For most children—like Tian Liang—current life was satisfactory. Food, clothing, clean rooms, no fleas. His scabies healed after several ointment applications. Though daily lessons and discipline constraints existed, these were tolerable.

Some older children—wild from years of wandering—had zero interest in literacy, refused to learn short-hairs' awkward neither-donkey-nor-horse Mandarin. Others couldn't tolerate discipline. After several failed hunger punishments, the most stubborn were transferred to production team apprentice squads.

Tian Liang often wanted to check on Guo Fu in the girls' dormitory—but high bamboo fences separated them. The connecting gate was always locked. Even peering through fences at crowds opposite—distinguishing Guo Fu was nearly impossible. Eventually, he gave up.

Ma Peng pushed a small wheelbarrow, creaking along field paths. On the cart: his family's sole possessions and his elderly mother.

"Peng'er, just going like this—will the short-hair masters accept us?"

"Ma, I've told you many times: family members—however many come—are accepted. Chief Wu personally said this."

"Ai, ai—you really... Why quit Mr. Fu's job! Mr. Fu treated us well."

"He treated us okay—but aren't short-hairs better?" Ma Peng energetically pushed the cart. "Working for short-hairs: every meal has rice—plus fish! Does Fu Buer have that? Busy season he only gives sweet potato rice. Eat too much and his wife grumbles."

While talking, behind them came a carrying-pole team—baskets full of unhulled rice—hurrying toward Bairren Fortress.

"Ma, see—they're all going to East Gate Market to sell grain. These short-hair chiefs—they've got more money than seawater." Ma Peng smacked his lips proudly—working for short-hairs seemed more respectable than laboring for village landlord Fu Buer.

While chatting, the lead carrier turned: "Young brother, also going to East Gate? Taking mother sightseeing?"

"I'm laboring for short-hairs. Fetching my mother over."

The lead man laughed heartily: "Young brother has guts! Daring to work for them."

"Nothing to it—short-hairs aren't three-headed six-armed man-eating monsters. They're actually decent." He rambled about being captured with Fu Buer, post-capture experiences, various tales.

"...I figure—working for anyone's the same. At least short-hairs feed you well."

The man nodded: "Exactly. Like our master—initially terrified of short-hairs. Then hearing short-hairs were buying grain at good prices—his thoughts stirred. Rushed to deliver grain. Official autumn taxes he delays and stalls. Here though—sold once, now this is the second trip."

"Rich folks just chase money."

Talking along, they reached East Gate Market. Barely half a month—already bustling. Among bamboo shed clusters, red-brick buildings stood prominent. Grain sellers' carts and carrying poles formed long queues. Opposite: the famous countywide "Welfare Society" shop—crowded. Besides commoners, even landlord types browsed, bargaining with attractively blue-clothed women. Ma Peng had left nearly a month—now everything seemed fresh. He increasingly felt returning was right—short-hair chiefs wouldn't leave!

He parted from the grain-selling team—Ma Peng's destination was the production team camp outside South Gate by Wenlan River. Passing construction sites, many unfamiliar people were building: not bamboo or rammed earth, but bright-red bricks. Ma Peng never imagined—this would become their home.

Bairren Production Team's return rate was astonishing. Wu De originally estimated 60–70% would return after harvest. Instead: 95%+ returned—many bringing families. Some hoping for better treatment followed along. Combined: 120% of original numbers. Better than their most optimistic estimates. Committee was overjoyed—previously unsure if they could attract popular support. Apparently they'd done well.

Migrants from Damei Village—now Wu De's designated "Bairren Production Team Two"—experienced their busiest harvest season ever. Men: logging, quarrying, digging, brick-firing. Women: spreading, winnowing, airing grain. Just the carrying teams delivering rice to riverside mills flowed endlessly—Bairren Fortress now had 1,300+ mouths requiring 1.5 tons of rice daily. Ma Qianzhu instructed: rice milling should only produce brown rice, not polished—preserving nutrients and increasing yield. Older women helped in kitchens. Even half-grown children worked in fields. From first cock crow to nightfall—daily work exceeded twelve hours. But despite exhaustion, short-hairs' provisions were excellent! No cooking needed—three hot meals delivered to worksites: unlimited rice, meat and fish at lunch and dinner, substantial and oily. Such meals they'd never seen, let alone eaten. Plus wages—though colorful paper slips. Earlier Production Team One members said these slips were valuable—could buy rice, fish, meat at cafeterias. Those with elderly or children to support could feed families on these work-point vouchers. So despite heavy labor—no complaints.

Ma Qianzhu came from large state enterprises—nostalgic for SOE welfare benefiting workers' families. Seeing many women unable to work due to young children—wasting labor—he established the first nursery. Freeing mothers for work. He recruited Fang Yijing—formerly a childcare teacher who'd managed transmigrators' dormitories; now residential area committee director—as nursery director. First: select women for basic childcare and hygiene training. Ma Qianzhu knew: changing long-term habits couldn't be forced. So he used economic incentives: families enrolling toddlers got children's three meals from cafeteria.
