# Chapter 912 – Special Propaganda

"It's fine. The plot about the Ming Cult's connection to the Great Ming has already been deleted by the Grand Library. It doesn't count for much. All the passages involving Zhu Yuanzhang have been modified too—there shouldn't be anything taboo." Zhao Yingong said, "The only problem is that it makes the plot a bit clunky and reads quite strangely."

Zhou Dongtian nodded. Exporting books to the Great Ming wasn't so much about making money as it was about the needs of external propaganda work—exporting new views on science, new values, new cultural concepts; promoting the "Australian way of life"; disturbing the thinking of Ming commoners and intellectuals; and subtly engineering "peaceful evolution." Even if this approach couldn't transform the entire society, it would at least plant the seeds of "pro-Australian" sentiment in some people's minds. It would cultivate a corps of "guides"—people who would help lead the way—and reduce resistance to future social reforms.

But exporting books raised the issue of social and historical backgrounds in literary works, and the problem of technology diffusion in popular science publications. Zhou Dongtian knew there had been fierce debates within the Senate over exactly what kinds of scientific and technical books to export and which technologies had to be restricted and kept secret. Some transmigrators believed no technology at all should be exported; others thought that disseminating basic scientific knowledge would actually promote the Great Cause.

Zhou Dongtian believed that European missionaries were currently working hard to attract certain discerning minds within the Ming by exporting European science and culture. By comparison, Australian goods were mostly presented as "clever novelties." Many people had shown keen interest in Australian science and culture, which surpassed even Western science. If they kept everything secret out of fear of some vague "threat," they'd only be shutting these people out.

He certainly didn't advocate indiscriminate technology diffusion, but spreading a lot of basic scientific knowledge did no harm. Take *Elementary Optics*, printed this time: to transmigrators, it was simple and easy to understand, but in this timeline, it was absolutely high technology. This popular science book had been written for "urban and rural readers with middle-school education" in the old timeline—and such readers were exceedingly rare in this era, if not virtually nonexistent.

Zhou Dongtian supported printing and selling more such popular science books. Many of the popular science series and agricultural technology books compiled in the 1960s and 70s for rural youth and educated youth could be published and sold in the Ming. Even if their ultimate fate was mostly to be treated as some kind of "esoteric text" and hidden away in private libraries.

Under current conditions, disseminating some simple knowledge and techniques posed absolutely no threat to the Senate. Given the material conditions of an agricultural society, much of the disseminated knowledge and technology had no practical applicability whatsoever—the social environment simply couldn't implement it. On the contrary, it would lead many interested researchers to discover that the only place where they could truly realize their ambitions was... Lingao.

As for techniques with practical applicability in the current social environment—such as scientific farming and animal husbandry methods—these only benefited Lingao, because the Senate had a voracious demand for agricultural products. From this perspective, improving Ming agricultural techniques was entirely advantageous.

Limited technology export, extensive cultural export—this was the dissemination strategy the Senate had established.

"Once this batch of books is sold, there'll probably be more demand," Zhou Dongtian said with a laugh. "I think manga will have tremendous impact. Actually, there's only so much Jin Yong we can pirate. Better to pirate Liang Yusheng, Chen Qingyun, and the rest in large quantities. Oh, and Huanzhu Louzhu too—sword-immortal novels should be even more to Ming tastes, don't you think?"

The two discussed the next steps for the publishing business. Zhou Dongtian and his group of transmigrators would soon be returning to Lingao. He planned to continue this cultural-invasion enterprise there.

"The next batch will be the transmigrators executing Operation Engine. Your place is becoming quite the thoroughfare. You'll have to work hard."

"That's my job," said Zhao Yingong. "This batch, I plan to accommodate at Phoenix Hill Villa. Unless necessary, I won't arrange for them to enter Hangzhou. Once Zhang Dai spreads the word, Qinghefang is going to become a bustling cultural salon. Better if transmigrators keep a low profile."

"Of course, of course. Have you built up your underground organization yet?"

Zhao Yingong was momentarily confused, but he quickly understood Zhou Dongtian meant a secret organization with no connection to his public identity or the Shanhai system.

"The Black Dragon Society system? I haven't started on that yet—it's rather dangerous work. You need powerful local operatives for it to function effectively," Zhao Yingong said. "If the people are too capable, they're hard to control; if they're not ruthless enough, they're useless." He asked in turn, "Do you have any ideas?"

"A few days ago, I received a telegram from Lingao."

Zhao Yingong nodded. The telegram had been received by the Hangzhou station's radio, but it was encrypted with another department's cipher. He didn't know its contents—only the header indicated it was for Zhou Dongtian.

"Actually, it's quite simple. It's about 'special propaganda'..." Zhou Dongtian said, stroking his beard. So-called "special propaganda" was a code invented by Zhao Manxiong—essentially a euphemism for "spreading rumors to deceive the public."

"Special propaganda" work had begun in Guangzhou after the victory of the Second Counter-Encirclement. The Guangzhou station had distributed large quantities of "special propaganda" pamphlets, using sensational stories and various "truths" to undermine Ming society's foundations.

Experience had shown that sex and politics were always content the masses loved to hear. Though such propaganda couldn't change any realities in the short term, the flood of "truths" that followed mass pamphlet distribution proved the technique was effective. A characteristic of agricultural society was that information spread mainly by word of mouth—the more sensational and explosive the news, the faster it spread. Neither officials nor the gentry class had sufficient means to refute rumors. Often they could only let rumors fade away on their own.

But this kind of dissemination required a secret organization to carry it out; "public figures" like Zhao Yingong couldn't be directly involved. Otherwise, any incident would destroy the Hangzhou station's foundations. Hence, organizations like the "Black Dragon Society"—dedicated to grassroots work—were essential.

Zhao Yingong planned to use the Zhejiang drought of 1631-1632 as an opportunity. During the social disorder, he would establish a Black Dragon Society underground network. Of course, the actual organizational personnel would be sent from Lingao. The Hangzhou station would maintain only single-line contact with this organization.

"The pamphlets can be printed at my place. I'm planning to set up a small printing shop at Phoenix Hill Villa, staffed specifically by a few woodblock-printing craftsmen. Have couriers bring the source materials; I'll print them and secretly ship them out for the Black Dragon Society to distribute. What do you think?"

"That sounds good." Zhou Dongtian smiled. "I know the Publishing Guidance Group has concocted all sorts of wild stuff—basically a blend of sex, politics, and lies. I've read a few. Quite creative, really..."

"Oh? Who wrote them?" Zhao Yingong's curiosity was piqued. Before his departure, he'd seen a few of these so-called "truth pamphlets" at the Foreign Intelligence Bureau. They were quite well crafted.

"A fellow named Zhang Haogu," said Zhou Dongtian. "You don't know him? He currently holds the title of Director of the Truth Office at the Grand Library. All the books you sell in the Ming have been reviewed and edited under his supervision."

"Zhang Haogu? That name sounds very familiar, but I can't quite remember who he is..."

"Achoo!" Zhang Haogu let out a mighty sneeze. He picked up a handkerchief and wiped his nose—Lingao didn't have the luxury of tissue paper. The only mass-produced hygiene paper was rough toilet paper and sanitary napkins for medical institutions and women. Cotton handkerchiefs, long vanished from daily life, had reappeared among the transmigrators—not that they minded, since the maids washed their clothes and handkerchiefs every day anyway.

He looked at the manuscript paper before him, densely covered with writing. Zhang Haogu had his own computer, but to conserve its lifespan, he only used it for particularly important tasks like "find-replace" and "keyword search" operations.

"Almost finished at last." He stretched lazily and flexed his sore wrists. On the rosewood desk lay thick stacks of manuscript paper; a pile of worn dip-pen nibs—under regulations, these had to be returned to stores before new ones could be drawn. An exquisitely crafted inkwell—European goods purchased from Macau.

Zhang Haogu picked up the manuscript on his desk. The cover bore several large characters: *Memoirs of an Imperial Medical Academy Physician*. The manuscript was thick—about three hundred thousand characters—and had cost him considerable effort. To write this book, he'd specifically consulted Liu San on many questions, to ensure the Chinese medicine concepts in the book were accurate.

Zhang Haogu was a transmigrator with a background in literature, history, and philosophy—a specialty that made it hard to be valued by the Senate. He'd been coasting at the Grand Library for a long time.

But he'd carved out his own niche. He'd submitted a memorial to the Executive Committee specifically on historical issues, proposing that from now on, there should be systematic efforts to "create history" and "control history." He proposed calling this department the "Ministry of Truth," to signify that truth from ancient times to the present was held in the hands of the Senate.

The proposal received the Executive Committee's "high attention," and Zhang Haogu was given the newly created position of Director of the Truth Office. But once he took up his post, he discovered that his main job was working for the "Publishing Guidance Group." This ad-hoc body, composed of Cultural Department representative Ding Ding, Grand Library representative Yu Eshui, and printing plant director Zhou Dongtian, needed to compile and publish large quantities of books and pamphlets. These required "disinfection"—removal of inappropriate content—and Zhang Haogu, having volunteered himself, became the perfect labor force.
