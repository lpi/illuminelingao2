# Chapter 1503 - Immigration

The journey was peaceful. *Dongshanju* left Kaohsiung for Shanghai, sold part of the goods there, bought large quantities of cotton cloth and grain, then proceeded to Longkou. After selling in Longkou, turned around to return, stopping at several ports in between. By the time it finally arrived at Bopu Port in Lingao, it was already late January 1634.

Although Lin Ming had been thinking of Lingao for years and always paid attention to collecting news about it, this was his first visit. Standing on the deck, seeing the port getting closer, the stone pier extending into the sea broad as a street, tall cranes, "automobiles" smoking and spitting fire pulling carriages running on rails... and finally Kun thieves' "Big Iron Ship." He originally thought these things wouldn't surprise him too much—these years he heard too many people talk about these miracles only attributable to "ghost and god power," and he himself secretly peeked near Guangzhou Great World construction site, seeing similar things more or less. However, when the port under Kun thieves' rule truly appeared before eyes, his breath was held instantly. The scene before eyes was a world completely beyond his comprehension scope.

Chimneys large and small spewed black smoke into air; white steam spewed with low sound of iron impact, permeating over wharf like a layer of faint clouds. Various cranes, pipes, tracks crisscrossed; whistles and sirens screamed sharply, rising one after another.

"Simply like arriving at Lion Camel Ridge [Journey to the West], demons dancing wildly!" Lin Ming couldn't help producing such association.

The harbor was full of ships. *Dongshanju* flew Lingao navigation flag, not first time to port; Captain knew way well, soon contacted a tugboat, towing *Dongshanju* to berth.

Ship just stopped steady, a small boat already smoking black smoke sailed towards *Dongshanju*. Several people on boat all wore Kun thief official uniforms—Lin Ming knew this was called "uniform"; all Kun thief subordinates "doing public duty" wore this. They came aboard for routine business, but also his first hurdle test.

If even this hurdle couldn't pass, infiltrating Lingao to find sister-in-law collecting intelligence would be empty talk. Better pack up and go home early.

Liu Deshan and Chen Huamin led main ship managers waiting on deck. Lin Ming pretended to bury head working by mast, stealing glances at movement on deck.

Saw Kun thieves on small boat board ship; indeed as rumor said, every one hair shorn like monk. Probably feeling bare head inelegant, so "public duty doers" everyone wore a hat. Some used rattan woven like overturned soup bowl, some simple cloth hat, extending a long brim in front of forehead. In Lin Ming's view truly indescribably weird.

Clothes on body also tight; waist bound with belt. Could see "official uniform" all sewn with cloth, all one color not only no silk etc., let alone rank badge, even basic patterns didn't exist—inferior even to public servants standing duty at yamen gate; at least their hats decorated with a bird feather. Speaking of decoration, barely counted were small colored cloth pieces on collar and a row of numbers sewn on chest—Lin Ming knew that was Arabic numerals, below numerals were two Chinese characters: "Port Service."

As for that belt, although leather, looked like not valuable fur, just ordinary cowhide. Whole body exuded a poverty air. But black curved handle revealed in triangular leather holster on belt was majestic. Lin Ming knew inside contained Kun thief "revolving self-generating hand gun," most terrible military weapon.

Such formidable firearm, actually just a few small "public duty doers" hung on waist; this Kun thief truly luxurious. Lin Ming thought since serving in Hundred Household Office, military weapons issued by court were unusable. Steel edge of swords received, some hilt and blade not installed firmly, slightly bumping would separate. Inferior to decades-old things in Hundred Household Office inventory. Foshan this place still okay: peaceful world, even some mountain bandits sea pirates mostly didn't need Jinyiwei to go out; occasionally going out on duty didn't need to move knife and gun. Instead brothers in north all complained going out on duty had to buy weapons themselves, otherwise meeting life-risking moments would definitely go wrong.

While sighing, ship owner and Kun thief conversation drifted to ear:

"...Any immigrants on ship?"

"None, all my own clerks." This was Chen Huamin's voice.

Suddenly Manager Liu's voice interjected: "Have ah, there is one, didn't that young man boarding at Taiwan say wanting to seek outlet in Lingao?"

Lin Ming knew this spoke of him, couldn't help secretly crying bitterness. He originally intended to disembark quietly, then mix into crowd quietly staying, didn't expect Manager Liu poked it out directly.

Cursed silently "Old Immortal," but dared not move blindly, still doing things on own, continuing to prick ears listening carefully.

"Since there is immigrant, call him to register. Arrange him to disembark for quarantine these few days."

"Yes, I'll call him." Manager Liu said raising throat, "Young man! Young man!"

Lin Ming naturally couldn't pretend deafness, had to act bewildered appearance, ran over hurriedly:

"Manager Liu, you called me?"

"Young man, didn't you want to come to Lingao to seek outlet? Quick register in these gentlemen's hands; registered counts as immigrant. Australians provide food and housing." Manager Liu said smilingly.

"This..." Lin Ming cried bitterness secretly. He already knew Kun thief routine; once registered, next step was entering some "Jinghua Camp" [Purification Camp], shave head bald, shower, spread butt to look at chrysanthemum, inevitably sitting in "prison" inside for over a month. At least two or three months without freedom of action, how could this do? Besides shaving hair bald, how could he return to Foshan; wouldn't that become iron proof of joining Kun!

He hurriedly piled smile saying: "Gentlemen Masters observe clearly! Body hair skin received from parents, little one dare not shave hair, only want to seek livelihood in Lingao..."

One Kun thief interrupted him: "I understand your meaning! Rest assured, our Senate doesn't force people to shave head. Just you unwilling to shave head, neither can join army nor get recruited. I see you speak culturedly, probably a scholar right..."

Manager Liu interjected: "Chief Master eye experienced: this young man well-read poetry and books, can write and calculate, also plays good hand of chess."

Port officer nodded: "You are scholar, cultured, arrive with us in less than few months can be a cadre. Why sell hard labor, be peddler for a few hairs? Not worth it!"

Lin Ming did full performance, wiping eyes said: "Chief Master is good hearted, little one also understands every sentence is golden jade good word. Just little one dare not violate Sage teaching. Little one parents both died early, ask Chief Master fulfill little one's piece of filial piety..." Saying still cried woo-woo.

He spoke sincerely, actually moved opponent. Port officer waved hand: "You a big man, cry what? Since filial piety commendable unwilling to shave head, not shaving then. Anyway here we are all voluntary. I just feel pity."

Lin Ming hurriedly lowered head: "Many thanks Chief Master fulfill little one's filial piety!"

"But even if unwilling to shave hair, must register to get ID, otherwise cannot make living in Lingao." Port officer said opening folder, taking out a quill pen, "You register first, name?"

"Lin Min." [Homophone of Ming]

"Age..."

Port officer roughly asked his name, age, native place and where came from etc., registered one by one then told him to press fingerprint, finally tore off a paper slip handing to him:

"After quarantine isolation period ends, within three days go to Customs Building—" He pointed to towering clock tower by harbor, "Entry Registration Office to register getting ID, remember must go on time!"

"Yes, yes, little one understands."

Lin Ming bowing and scraping received it to look, printed on top "Temporary ID Card Processing Slip," below was printed format: a string of Arabic numerals, above already filled his name, also listed information like which ship came on. From perforation seal could see this was upper and lower copy; upper copy inevitably stayed in so-called "Port Service" hand of Kun thief.

Finished processing immigration affairs, Port Service checked ship weapons, gunpowder one by one, seeing if sealed, spot checked cargo according to manifest. Lingao although had Customs, executed tariff very low; many goods zero tariff, so smuggling check not strict. After inspection, unavoidably routine of spraying medicine water disinfection. However ports *Dongshanju* passed recently had no plague outbreak reports; quarantine process relatively simple.

Seeing Port Service disembark leaving, Manager Liu paced over, shaking head: "Pity ah, truly pity, people valued you very much..."

"Little one truly couldn't bear..."

"Know, know." Manager Liu nodded, "People each have will. Now still can't disembark, trouble you stay on ship accompany me old man a few more days; wages naturally clear to you then."

Lin Ming then knew couldn't disembark now; must pass several days of "Isolation Period." During period no one could disembark. Report personnel health to patrol ship daily; if anyone sick, immediately report, shore immediately send doctor to look.

"This Australian truly good hearted, even cares for seeing doctor..."

Manager Liu chuckled a few times: "Young man, what you understand? They are fearing spreading plague! So allow no one disembark. If really someone falls ill, we all must enter 'Jinghua Camp'—then no matter what filial piety or not, all must shave bald head bathe daily, eat thin congee for few months. Maybe even ship and goods dragged to open sea burned with one fire!"

Lin Ming startled: "Really so severe?"

"Naturally. Nowadays Lingao coming going so many people, yet extremely rarely spread plague, rely exactly on this system. Although somewhat unreasonable, actually very useful!"
