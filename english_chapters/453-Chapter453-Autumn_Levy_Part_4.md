# Chapter 453 - Autumn Levy (Part 4)

Zhou Botao picked up a case file that had just been placed on his desk—locally manufactured at Zhou Dongtian's paper factory, made of coarse yellow paper, weighty in his hands. He opened the cover to find page after page of personal dossiers, each with a photograph attached. These were the profiles of the "grain runners" who had attended the recent meeting; their background investigations had just been completed.

Qiuhong's house had long been under Action Division surveillance, but since guards were posted around it, they couldn't install listening devices. Zhou Botao hadn't arranged for anyone to approach and monitor using a peddler disguise either—that would have been too conspicuous. In a rural residence with no commercial activity whatsoever, a cluster of peddlers would obviously arouse suspicion. Instead, he had arranged for long-range observation with binoculars.

Now they had identified the complete roster and backgrounds of every grain runner in Lingao County. Zhou Botao intended to study this group carefully to see if there was anyone he could use—or, alternatively, if the decision was simply to "eliminate" them. That would depend on the Executive Committee's wishes.

Zhou Botao flipped to the final pages containing materials on Zhou Qi. He was very interested in Chen Minggang's senior apprentice because the investigation had revealed that the master strongly suspected something unclear between Zhou Qi and his mistress, though he'd never found proof.

Zhou Botao was particularly interested in rumors involving romantic entanglements. Based on his experience as a detective, once whispers of romantic scandal reached a certain level, the matter was usually genuine. It was much like when a wife first suspected her husband of infidelity—investigation nearly always confirmed that something had indeed happened.

He sent for Wu Xiang and handed over the file. "Go investigate Zhou Qi."

"Eighth Master's apprentice?" Wu Xiang's expression revealed a trace of fear.

Zhou Botao looked at him with displeasure. "What, are you scared of him?"

Wu Xiang swallowed. "No."

"Good." Zhou Botao said, "You're our man now. What's there to fear about some 'Eighth Master' or 'Ninth Master'? Find out everything about Zhou Qi. From now on, keep him under constant surveillance. Report his every move to me—I want to know exactly when he takes a shit and when he goes to sleep. Understood?"

"Yes, understood."

The answer was acceptable enough. Watching Wu Xiang's departing figure, Zhou Botao gave him a contemptuous look. This fellow was supposed to have a blood feud, someone who hated the old society. He had performed quite well in school, displaying a strong sense of grievance. But the moment he started actual fieldwork, he showed no courage whatsoever. Confronting county yamen personnel or local strongmen, he still unconsciously displayed a kind of servile deference.

"Seems like hatred isn't a universal panacea." Zhou Botao muttered, then picked up a written order, opened it, and glanced at it. He rang a bell to summon his orderly.

"Get the leader of the Special Propaganda Team. Yes, immediately!"

After Chen Minggang paid his respects to Xiong Buyou and received approval, he immediately set to work in earnest. Besides the customary posting of proclamations and distribution of "grain notices"—essentially payment demand slips—by the county yamen, he also gathered his disciples and minions to set up collection stations in front of the county granary.

The first phase of grain collection naturally involved waiting for the grain households to come and pay on their own initiative. Only after this phase ended would they enter the stage of going out to the villages to enforce collection. But this year, Chen Minggang ordered all the grain runners to go out to the countryside and vigorously spread news of the "land survey."

In no time at all, word that the Australians intended to "conduct a land survey" had spread throughout the county, throwing major and minor grain households alike into a panic.

The gentry naturally wanted nothing to do with a land survey. No matter how corrupt and inefficient the existing system was, they had already reached an accommodation with it. As long as they paid a certain price as "lubricant," they could do whatever they pleased within the system. Now a new force had arrived that actually wanted to re-survey all the farmland and re-register property ownership—this was like a bolt from the blue. The grain households immediately grew anxious. Then, from the mouths of the grain runners who had gone out to the countryside, they received confirmation: the Australians not only intended to collect grain this time but also to conduct a land survey first and levy grain based on acreage.

The grain households hastened to send people everywhere to gather information. Indeed, both the county seat and the East Gate Market were buzzing with talk of this matter, with people speaking as if they had firsthand knowledge. Chen Minggang's crowd of hangers-on strutted about with self-important airs. Yet strange counter-rumors also emerged, claiming none of this was true—that Chen Minggang and his gang were simply using the Australians' name to scare people.

Everyone rushed to find Zhang Youfu to confirm whether there was any truth to this. But they got no definite answer from him either. Zhang Youfu said that Chief Wu, who was in charge of the grain levy, had "gone on a long trip" and no one was available to respond. Zhang Youfu was somewhat startled by these developments, but remembering what Wu De had instructed him earlier, he sensed there must be something more going on behind the scenes. He didn't dare speak carelessly. He immediately traveled to Bairren City to request an audience with Chuyu and reported the situation.

Of course, he received no response from Chuyu either. Zhang Youfu stood in the courtyard of his own residence, studying the "grain notice" that a runner had just delivered, and furrowed his brow for several minutes. Suddenly, something clicked and he began to understand.

---

Liu Youren sat on a bamboo couch beneath the steps of his main courtyard, smoking a dry tobacco pipe. Wisps of blue smoke curled upward. On a bamboo table sat a teapot, teacups, and a sheet of coarse mulberry paper—this was the "grain notice."

The grain notice was a collection demand slip. The government hadn't originally used such things; it only had grain tallies—collection receipts. This was something the yamen clerks had devised on their own: extremely coarse mulberry paper, pre-printed with stamps and formatted spaces for clerks to fill in the grain household's name and the amount of base grain and tribute rice owed. Once a household received this slip, it was required to pay by the deadline. The deadlines were divided into first, second, and third terms. After the third term passed, the collection entered the "dunning phase," whereupon delinquent households would be hauled to the yamen and subjected to flogging every three or five days, or else pilloried in public.

In practice, this was mostly talk. Those who actually got dragged to the yamen for beatings and the cangue were defenseless, isolated small grain households—people like Zhang Xingjiao had once been. Any grain household with the slightest local influence would never be treated this way. Some were village rogues who, though lacking political power, were tough customers willing to fight and kill. If they refused to pay the full levy, they'd send some able-bodied man to take the punishment in their stead, bribe the bailiffs a little, and fake their way through the flogging. They'd toughen it out until the New Year, get someone to post bail for their release, and the year would be considered settled. Grain households of even higher standing could haggle with the runners and clerks over precisely how much tribute rice they would pay. The truly powerful ones paid nothing beyond the base quota. As for the gentry and strongmen, most of them had hidden vast amounts of land, and basically paid nothing at all—even if the yamen knew, it could only turn a blind eye.

The Liu family had once been local strongmen from Jialai. After Liu Youren purchased himself a *jiansheng* degree, they became "gentry." His family's registered land holdings were less than four hundred *mu*, but in reality they possessed nearly two thousand *mu*. And the land "falsely registered" under the Liu family name exceeded three thousand *mu* more.

Beyond the four hundred *mu* of registered paddy fields they worked using hired farmhands, none of their other land ever contributed a single grain in taxes.

Liu Youren had previously approached the Australians with the same strategy he used against bandits: on one hand, fortify the stronghold and train militia for self-defense; on the other, humor them—if they wanted some benefit, he'd accommodate within his means and buy peace. After all, this region had operated this way since his grandfather's time.

But after attending the Political Consultative Conference and witnessing the Baldies' power, his thinking changed. Liu Youren realized that simply humoring them the way he'd dealt with bandits would lead to losses. The strength and conduct the Australians had demonstrated suggested they harbored vast ambitions—ambitions unlikely to be satisfied by Lingao alone.

Such ambitions were certainly not something a rural strongman like himself could possibly block. If the Liu family wanted to survive in Lingao and avoid sharing Gou Family Manor's fate, they would have to be more proactive. At the very least, that would buy them self-preservation.

Therefore, although he seldom visited the East Gate Market, he actually kept close watch on the Australians' every move. As soon as the Tiandihui was established, he joined. At the time, his decision had startled the Liu family elders, who expressed strong opposition—how could they reveal the family's true situation to the Australians? Even though they reported only the officially taxed acreage, the Australian agricultural technicians weren't fools; after a few visits for "technical guidance," they'd figure things out.

Liu Youren patiently persuaded them: even if he didn't join, did they think the Australians wouldn't find out how much land the Liu family actually held? That was hardly a secret in the county. Naturally, someone eager to curry favor would report it to the Australians. Rather than waiting for them to come knocking, it was better to engage with them first to facilitate maneuvering.

After joining the Tiandihui, agricultural technicians came to help him make compost, deliver seedlings, and instruct his farmhands on cultivation. Their earnestness far exceeded Liu Youren's expectations. He couldn't understand why the Australians would go to such lengths—if it was just to collect a few "service fees," a simple order to the liaison officer would ensure every village paid up. Why bother with such laborious nonsense?

Just as he was puzzling over this, the grain-levy contracting affair had left him even more bewildered. He felt completely unable to fathom the Australians' thinking.

His gaze fell once again on the grain notice. The columns for the base quota and tribute rice amounts were left blank. The grain runner who delivered it said that according to orders from the Australian masters, this levy would be accompanied by a "land survey." Each household was required to report its land holdings before the first deadline, and grain would be levied based on the new acreage figures.

"Eighth Master says this is the Australians' first time contracting the grain levy in the county. Each household had better pitch in a little and report more accurate land figures—don't provoke them." The grain runner who came smirked insincerely. "This way everyone can get by, and those of us carrying out orders can give a proper accounting."
