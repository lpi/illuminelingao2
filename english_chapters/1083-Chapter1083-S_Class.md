# Chapter 1083 - S-Class

There were already more than two thousand rebels in Huang County. Adding three thousand reinforcements and a large number of coerced local able-bodied men, the military force already had a huge advantage. Mao Chenglu was also a veteran general. No matter how powerful the opponent's firearms were, they might not be able to resist—not to mention that cannons were also allocated.

So after they decided, they turned their attention to discussing the attack on Laizhou.

On Qimu Island, at this time, it was immersed in a jubilant atmosphere. Several tycoons of the Shandong Office surrounded the stove, all beaming with joy.

Zhu Mingxia returned to the Baimatang relay camp after recovering a large group of refugees. Relying on his "scattering beans to become soldiers" formation, he not only scared off the small group of pursuing troops tailing them but also recovered more refugees along the way.

That night, he led the army to spend the night at the Baimatang relay camp. Early the next morning, he was besieged by more than a thousand rebels chasing from Huang County. As a result, not only were more than two hundred people killed, but several hundred prisoners were also captured.

After returning to Qimu Island, the number was roughly estimated: this operation, including the recovered refugees and prisoners, totaled more than three thousand eight hundred people. It was their largest one-time harvest in Dengzhou.

Moreover, the composition of the population was very ideal. Because most of the refugees in this group fled in groups of clans and villages, the gender balance of men and women in the crowd was relatively equal, and there were also a large number of children—these were all the population the Senate liked most. Especially after roughly browsing the refugee group, there were quite a few women whose height seemed to conform to the original aesthetic vision, which boosted the morale of the Senators of the Qimu Island Forward Command even more.

Although these women were currently disheveled and hunchbacked, as long as they had enough to eat and got good rest, most of them were good stock.

Not only was the Ziming Tower in Lingao expected to replenish technicians, but the life secretaries of the Senate also had hope for an upgrade.

Just these were enough to make the Senators of the Shandong Office shout "worth it" for coming to this barren island through wind, snow, and frost with untold hardships!

Besides the not-so-"noble" starting point of satisfying their own physiological needs, the credit of providing high-quality life secretaries for the majority of Senators would undoubtedly add many points to their prestige value. This would have a huge impact on their future status in the Senate!

"It seems coming to Shandong was right!" Lu Wenyuan grinned with a very lewd smile, "I have to choose carefully first myself—the pavilion closest to the water enjoys moonlight first..."

"That won't do—if that bunch in the Senate knows, they'll eat you alive." Zhu Mingxia shook his head repeatedly, "Women, there are plenty of good ones. Let's not sit with our butts crooked ourselves; it won't be good if people grab our pigtails (catch our faults)."

Chen Sigen chuckled: "Little Lu, you are still too young, too simple (*tu yang tu sen po*)..."

Just as they were talking, the bell outside rang.

"Oh, the bell for card distribution rang. The card distribution work for new refugees is about to begin. I'll go over first. After processing this batch of people, send a few more ships to Jeju Island as soon as possible. There are too many people on the island—if we don't transport them away, I'm afraid I won't be able to manage them."

Three thousand people were just sent away to Jeju the day before yesterday. Now on the island, plus those just recovered, there were fully eight thousand refugees, making the refugee camp overflow. Moreover, one or two thousand people would flood into the refugee camp every day recently. Facilities were seriously overloaded. Right now, they could only guarantee that all women, children, and the elderly lived in houses. Many people could only sleep in the open in the camp and roast fires to survive. This was a huge test for the safety, hygiene, and management of the refugee camp.

Zhu Mingxia left the fortress, mounted a horse, and went all the way to the temporary relay station of the refugee camp surrounded by guards—continuous transfer of refugees made the island overcrowded, and management became difficult. Lu Wenyuan specially circled a piece of land to issue refugee cards. Refugees entered Qimu Island and first assembled here. There were no houses here, just a piece of land simply circled by wooden fences. Of course, they didn't have to spend the night here, just resting a little. After registering and collecting the refugee card and meal card, they would leave.

Refugee card issuance was proposed by Zhu Mingxia. Soldiers had dog tags, so refugees should have their own refugee cards. This facilitated management and grasping the refugee situation at all times—especially accurate counting. For special groups, special refugee card codes made it easy to find these people, for example, maidservants.

Most Senators were very interested in the potential maidservant wave. The Executive Committee also intended to use this opportunity to give everyone some benefits. Under informal authorization, Zhu Mingxia engaged the task of finding high-quality maidservants. It was very difficult to find young beauties among thousands of sallow and emaciated refugees with disheveled faces. Most people would only feel dazzled after looking, and finally say there was only a bunch of potatoes. But in Zhu Mingxia's view, even if their faces were smeared with charcoal dust and they looked haggard, he could pick them out one by one.

According to him, one must look at beauties from the perspective of human anatomy, looking at the height of the brow bone and nose bone, the distance between the two eyes, the position of the hip bone, etc. Only in this way could effective "quantitative management" be implemented. Otherwise, "beautiful appearance" was purely a standard that varied too much from person to person.

But finding them slowly from thousands of people was too inefficient, so Zhu Mingxia came up with the refugee card. Only with a refugee card was one a refugee of Qimu Island. Only refugees of Qimu Island were qualified to receive a meal card. Only with a meal card was food given.

Long lines had formed at the card distribution place. Refugees lined up according to age and gender maintained by village braves holding wooden sticks: First, refugees were divided into three groups: men, women, and children under twelve according to gender; the men and women groups collected refugee cards separately, and then were divided into three subgroups according to approximate age: 12-25 years old, 25-40 years old, and over 40 years old.

Each subgroup went to the designated location to collect meal cards. After collecting meal cards, they went to the assembly point to find their relatives and friends, becoming a formal refugee.

Card distribution was done by village. After one village finished, the next village came. Scattered refugees were gathered by naturalized citizens before going to collect cards. To maintain order, Zhu Mingxia used a large number of Qimu Island village braves to maintain order, coordinated with soldiers of the Northbound Detachment with fixed bayonets to suppress the scene. Then he found work team members with kind faces from among the naturalized citizens to stabilize the people's hearts.

Zhu Mingxia guarded the position where women aged 12-25 collected meal cards. Seeing a possibly suitable woman, he would nod, and the card distributor would issue a meal card starting with the letter Z to the refugee. Behind him stood three naturalized citizens. he had explained the essentials of selecting people to these three people in detail by using himself as an example. Now that he was still on Qimu Island, he did it himself, and the naturalized citizens also took this opportunity to intern. When he was too busy to do these jobs every moment, it would rely entirely on these people to choose in the future. The selected female refugees holding Z cards were screened again and divided into B, A, and S-class maidservant candidates. As for those below B class, they would be screened again after being transported to Jeju.

Continuous screening of refugees still made Zhu Mingxia a bit dizzy. He rubbed his eyes. Anyway, this was the last check, so he persisted to the end. For the sake of the sisters of the Senate, persist a bit more. After dozens more people passed, a thin figure caught his attention. A slender little girl held a Pipa (lute) taller than her tightly, blocking most of her person. The whole person hugging the Pipa mostly covered her face. Zhu Mingxia observed. Looking at the body shape, she was still a little girl. Her face was tightly pressed against the Pipa, and her looks couldn't be seen. The position of the hip bone was quite high, which aroused his interest. He walked into the girl and knocked on the Pipa.

"Look up."

The girl timidly raised her small head, revealing terrified eyes. Her yellow and thin cheeks almost caught up with E.T. the Extraterrestrial, standard refugee appearance. Zhu Mingxia observed carefully and felt she was not bad and had potential to dig. Moreover, she didn't bind her feet. It was a pity that her cheekbones were slightly high; otherwise, it would be even better.

"How old? Can you play Pipa?"

"Can, can. Fifteen, Master." The girl was obviously frightened by Zhu Mingxia, speaking with a slight stutter.

The following few simple questions and answers allowed Zhu Mingxia to learn more about the little girl. She was a member of a street singing small opera troupe. Because the number of people was small, they were mixed with other scattered personnel to collect refugee cards. There were other sisters behind. Zhu Mingxia looked back and indeed saw a woman with a bamboo flute in her hand. Unfortunately, her looks were average. This didn't matter; he urgently needed people who could play instruments, and now he had found them.

Under the girl's guidance, Zhu Mingxia found the troupe leader. The troupe leader was surnamed Liu, a woman in her thirties. Wandering life had carved lines on her face, and her gray hair made her look almost fifty.

Zhu Mingxia was not wearing the Fubo Army uniform at this time, but a fur coat made in Lingao. Liu hesitated when addressing him, and finally decided to call him General. This form of address made Zhu Mingxia feel very useful, and his gaze was slightly gentler. Liu's rich life experience allowed her to grasp this momentary change, and she talked eloquently to promote her opera troupe. Liu had a typical Southern aaccent, but fortunately, Zhu Mingxia could understand. In Liu's self-blowing narrative mixed with truth and falsehood, he gained a general understanding of these people.

Troupe Leader Liu used to be a prostitute in a brothel in Nanjing. She was sold into the brothel since childhood. Because her looks were slightly inferior, she put special effort into music theory. She was proficient in blowing, pulling, playing, and singing, and actually became the signboard of the brothel. She sold her body for many years and originally had quite a bit of savings, but she didn't expect that the brothel's booming business made others envious, colluding with the government to forcibly occupy this property. Logically speaking, this had little to do with her; the brothel just changed an owner. But unexpectedly, other prostitutes who had always been unconvinced by her took the opportunity to make trouble, squeezing her out through the new owner. Not only were most of her savings lost, but she was also disfigured by her enemies. Thanks to her proficiency in music theory, she managed to pull together a small opera troupe by singing on the street; otherwise, she would probably have starved to death on the street.

Over ten years, by adopting street urchins and buying daughters from poor families, the opera troupe developed from a few people initially to a dozen people. Because she heard that rich merchants gathered in the Dengzhou area and business was easy to do, she took a boat from Songjiang to here. She didn't expect to encounter Kong Youde's mutiny not long after staying in Dengzhou. The troupe leader knew she couldn't hide in the city during times of turmoil and chaos, so she hid in a stockade she was familiar with in the past.
