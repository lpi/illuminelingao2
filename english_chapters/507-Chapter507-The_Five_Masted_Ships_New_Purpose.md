# Chapter 507 - The Five-Masted Ship's New Purpose

Hai Ji went to inspect the ship and found himself in a quandary. The five-masted vessel had been docked there for some time. It had already sustained considerable damage during the pirate attack and grounding—masts and sails had been destroyed, and the hull had been breached in places. After being towed back to Lingao, only minimal repairs had been made to keep it afloat. The Navy had originally planned to overhaul and refit it for use as an ocean-going craft, but once Ma Jia established his admiralty court, ownership of the ship became uncertain, and it was left unattended. In the meantime, a typhoon had struck, and the vessel that now greeted Hai Ji's eyes was a pitiful sight—only three masts remained; the rigging was largely ruined; and the cabins on deck were badly damaged.

Even if such a ship were sailed back, major repairs would be necessary before it could be sold; otherwise it would fetch only firewood prices. Moreover, navigating the perilous Qiongzhou Strait to bring it home was no easy task. Hai Ji could not make up his mind. He heard the Australian official surnamed Ma mention that the Australians were interested in buying the ship. That seemed a sensible solution, but he did not know his master's wishes and dared not decide on his own; he had better return first and consult.

Hai Shuzu, however, insisted on bringing the ship back. Hai Ji pointed out, to no avail, that doing so would require a large sum for repairs, hiring a full crew, and braving the strait—with no guarantee of avoiding another pirate attack. Even if the ship reached Shenying Harbor safely, selling such a large vessel would take time. All things considered, it would be more practical to sell it to the Australians on the spot.

But Hai Shuzu was adamant. With no alternative, Hai Ji returned to Lingao with the silver to have the ship repaired. Though he knew nothing of ships or seamanship, even a glance told him repairs would not come cheap. There was no telling how long they would take. At least his master allowed him to "just get it seaworthy enough to sail home."

Hai Ji's repair mission, however, received an unexpectedly warm welcome from Li Di, the port authority chief at Bopu. Li Di offered to arrange contact with the shipyard and, moreover, to waive repair costs—on condition that the five-masted ship help transport a consignment of cargo on its return voyage to Qiongshan. Flustered by such enthusiasm, Hai Ji readily agreed.

The shipyard set to work at once. The five-masted vessel was hauled into drydock. The hull was meticulously patched, and the damaged masts and sails were restored. Citing a shortage of mast timber, the yard repaired only the three masts that remained relatively intact; the other two were removed entirely. Certain odd modifications were made to the interior and deck as well: two large cargo hatches were cut into the deck, and iron boat davits were installed along both gunwales. Finally, hand-cranked derricks were mounted on the fore and aft decks.

Further structural work was carried out below decks to facilitate future refits.

By now, repairing and modifying wooden vessels at the shipyard was almost routine. They had a drydock, steam-powered cranes, a ship-timber workshop fully equipped with woodworking machinery—the necessary materials could be fabricated in short order. Shipbuilding hardware had been standardized. Combined with modern process-flow management, the yard operated around the clock, completing the overhaul in seven days.

Under Li Di's direction, batch after batch of cargo was loaded onto the ship until its waterline sank to the fully laden mark. At last, four flat-bottomed skiffs were hoisted by a steam crane that puffed white vapor and carefully hung on the davits by a group of workers.

Hai Ji found the transformed appearance of his master's ship baffling. Still, since they intended to sell it in Qiongshan anyway, it mattered little what shape it was in—so long as it could make the voyage. Besides, Mister Li, the Australian, had promised that in exchange for hauling the cargo the repairs would be free, and even the expense of hiring sailors would be covered. Hai Ji need only accompany the ship back to Qiongshan.

Escorted by patrol boats, the great ship set sail. Three days later, Hai Shuzu's vessel finally returned to Shenying Harbor. When the five-masted ship flying the Hai family's banner entered port, all of Qiongzhou Prefecture was astir—no one had expected a ship lost to pirates and unheard from for over two months to reappear. Many who had wondered at Hai Shuzu's sudden ability to pay his debts now assumed he must have made a fortune somewhere along the way.

Not only had the ship returned, but it was laden with cargo—uniform large wooden crates reinforced with iron strapping. No one knew what was inside. Only Lin Baiguang knew: mining equipment and supplies. The four flat-bottomed skiffs were also purpose-built for the mining operation.

Thanks to Hai Shuzu's reputation and appropriate bribes, the Qinglan Patrol Inspector's check of the cargo was perfunctory. Once docked, the cargo remained aboard; Hai Ji proceeded directly to report to Hai Shuzu.

"Truly extraordinary!" Hai Shuzu gazed at the chest of silver before him, his spirits soaring. "I never imagined the Australians would actually keep their word and convert the cargo into silver!"

"Still less the twenty percent they deducted," Lin Baiguang thought with a private smile.

"Well! From what the returning crew said, had they not intervened, I would have lost ship and cargo entirely—where else would I have gotten over a thousand taels and a ship back?" Hai Shuzu looked not at all like a man who had suffered losses but rather one who had stumbled upon a windfall, his face radiant with joy.

"And I owe much of this to you, worthy brother!" Hai Shuzu bowed deeply. "Without your intervention, this could never have gone so smoothly."

"You flatter me. This was simply following Australian regulations. I merely sent someone to show the way—nothing more."

"Keeping faith, upholding righteousness! Though they are men from beyond the seas, they are in no way inferior to the people of our Central Kingdom!" Hai Shuzu was ready to sing the Australians' praises to the heavens. He opened the judgment documents Hai Ji had brought. His attention was first caught by the unusual binding and the crisp, white paper. As he read through several pages, his expression gradually turned grave.

Lin Baiguang thought: these legal documents were incomprehensible even to most of the transmigrators—probably no more than twenty in the collective could make sense of them. Could Hai Shuzu really understand a text full of technical terms and simplified characters?

After a long silence, Hai Shuzu set down the documents without a word. Lin Baiguang wondered how much he had actually grasped and was about to ask when Hai Shuzu spoke:

"The Australians are truly remarkable."

"Oh?"

"Though I do not fully understand the contents of this document, I gather roughly seven or eight parts of its meaning," Hai Shuzu said. "The meticulousness of the reasoning, the rigor of the execution—I have never seen the like."

While Hai Shuzu was still marveling, Hai Ji grew anxious. His only concern was his master's welfare. He recalled that Mister Li in Lingao had said they would buy the ship if Hai Shuzu wished to sell. Now that the ship had reached Haikou and had been shown off, it was best to sell it at once. He spoke up:

"Master, the Australians in Lingao are willing to buy the ship. Would you consider—"

"Very well. Let's sell it to them." Hai Shuzu's impression of the Australians was now sky-high, and the instincts of a scion of a distinguished house took over; his answer was brisk. "Five hundred taels will do—"

"Master, but—but—but…" Hai Ji was frantic. It had cost nearly two thousand taels to build this ship. Damaged though it was and short two masts, now that it had been repaired, it ought to fetch at least a thousand taels.

Lin Baiguang smiled. "Five hundred is far too cheap. Steward Hai has gone to such lengths to bring it back; there's no need to sell it at such a loss."

In the end, the price was set at one thousand taels. The party that had accompanied the ship paid on the spot, and the vessel was now the property of the transmigrated collective. The Maritime Forces Division intended to use it for coal transport between Qiongshan and Lingao. There was an unexpected side benefit: although ownership had changed, everyone assumed the ship still belonged to the Hai family.

Hai Shuzu was quite satisfied with the transaction; Hai Ji, however, thought it a bad bargain. If they had meant to sell the ship, they might as well have sold it in Lingao and spared themselves the trouble of sailing it back—wasting time and money, not to mention two round trips for him. The master, he mused, was evidently a man who would suffer just to save face.

Still, Hai Ji was pleased with his visit to Lingao—it had been an eye-opener. He had seen the legendary iron ships and many other wonders. Now back home, he had inexhaustible anecdotes to share with the household.

Preparations for the coal mine advanced briskly. Lin Baiguang found himself cast as chairman of the Coal Mine Preparatory Committee. The newly renovated shop was packed with survey and engineering personnel from Lingao. This was highly improper—Gao Di had purchased property in Qiongshan's commercial district, a busy area with constant foot traffic. Having a band of strangers—whose odd appearance showed through even in Ming-dynasty attire—congregating here and coming and going daily, even if ferried by sedan chair, would eventually arouse suspicion.

They needed to move to the mine site as soon as possible. The Long-Range Exploration Team had already identified several extraction points. The coal resources around Haikou consisted mainly of small deposits, of limited economic value by modern standards. Among the candidate sites, the Planning Commission ultimately selected the Jiazi Mine on the banks of the Nandu River.

Conditions at this mine were not the best among the options, and reserves were small. Its chief advantage was convenient water transport. From the extraction point, it was only ten kilometers east to the Nandu River. From there, small flat-bottomed boats could sail directly to the river's mouth. This would facilitate the import of mining equipment and supplies as well as the export of extracted coal, bypassing the arduous task of road construction in mountainous terrain.

With Hai Shuzu acting as front man, the hills at the Jiazi Mine site were purchased. Lin Baiguang suggested buying the other candidate sites as well, but Ma Qianzhu deemed it unnecessary—these would become state assets in due course and could simply be requisitioned. No need to go to the trouble.

Through Hai Shuzu, Lin Baiguang had already acquired a parcel of land in a remote corner of the harbor, where a warehouse and pier had been built. They now possessed their own dedicated dock. In the future, coal would be carried by flat-bottomed boats down the Nandu River to the dock, stored in the warehouse, and loaded onto larger vessels for transshipment.

*Note: There is no such place as "Jiazi Coal Mine" near Haikou, nor is it situated on the banks of the Nandu River. This is entirely fictional—please do not scrutinize. The name borrows from the administrative district "Jiazi Township," where Haikou's Changchang Coal Mine is actually located.*

*Hainan produces lignite in only two locations: Haikou's Changchang Mine and Danzhou's Changpo Mine. Neither is near a river.*
