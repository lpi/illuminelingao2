# Chapter 1341 - A Sense of Estrangement

Dai Yan brought back three food trays one after another, then left again. Before long, she returned with a mysterious look on her face.

"Mother, drink this!"

Her mother accepted the bottle her daughter handed over like presenting a treasure. She shook it, looking at the bottle filled with white liquid, then suddenly realized it was glass. Her hand immediately trembled, nearly dropping it.

"Daughter, what is this?"

"It's called milk. The cafeteria only started serving it last month, and only our section gets it in the morning. I got first place in two subjects on last month's exam, so I got two reward coupons. I exchanged them for two bottles for you to try!" Dai Yan spoke rapidly, presenting another bottle to her father like a treasure.

Dai Dehou looked at the bottle in his hand and was immediately stunned. This was crystal glass!

The milk bottle before him was different from the colored glassware that had begun selling in large quantities at low prices in the market. This was transparent crystal glass, with extremely fine craftsmanship. Going to market to exchange it would easily fetch one or two taels of silver.

The leaders were truly generous. Filled with gratitude, Dai Dehou's hand also began trembling slightly. He hastily set the bottle on the table.

Dai Yan was quite used to such things. She took the bottle, expertly untied the cotton string, opened the paper seal, and handed it back.

With her daughter repeatedly waving and urging, Dai Dehou picked up the bottle and carefully took a sip. It had a faint sweetness upon entering the mouth, then a peculiar fragrance began spreading through his mouth.

"It's good, right? Mother, you drink too!" Dai Yan opened the other bottle and passed it to her mother. Watching her start to drink, she was finally satisfied.

Dai Yan's mother wasn't used to this milk with its faint "fishy" taste, but not wanting to disappoint her daughter's kindness, she steeled herself and drank it down.

Dai Yan was the type who couldn't sit still. She pushed the food tray in front of her parents, then picked up the food box her mother had brought and opened it. She made a face, unwrapped the cotton cloth around the food container, lifted the lid, and placed the still-warm large yellow croaker before her.

"I said last time not to bring food! The school treats us so well—every meal has fish and meat, and we're not even allowed to leave anything uneaten!"

Dai Dehou looked at the rattan food tray before him. Inside were several bowls made from coconut shells—not only taro braised with chicken, but also a dish of pork slices stir-fried with red and green vegetables, plus a bowl of vegetable and egg-drop soup. More refined than what they ate at home.

The three began eating. His wife picked up an unfamiliar green dried vegetable beside the meat slices, put it in her mouth and bit down. Immediately a pungent sensation spread through her mouth, after which she could no longer maintain proper manners—she opened her mouth and kept panting.

"Hee hee, that's a bit spicy, isn't it? It's fine—drink some milk and it'll be better." Dai Yan giggled: "I asked a teacher—this chili pepper stimulates the appetite. It's from the Americas—well, that's a very, very far island to our southwest. The leaders brought it over to plant here in Lingao."

Though chili peppers had long been for sale in the market, they were relatively expensive, and with different dietary customs, apart from wealthy households and naturalized citizen cadres, ordinary Lingao commoners rarely bought them to eat. Even though Dai Dehou and his wife had seen all sorts of round and pointed, red and green chili peppers at the Red Flower Society's fruit and vegetable direct sales store, they had truly never eaten them.

Their daughter kept using unfamiliar words. Dai Dehou had never heard of these places. Seeing how accomplished his daughter had become, his heart was both proud and anxious for his son Dai Yu.

No matter how accomplished a daughter was, she would ultimately benefit an outsider's family. How much benefit could their own family gain?

He was eating with his head down when his wife suddenly said softly: "Look, that's a leader's child."

Dai Dehou had long heard there were "young transmigrators"—they had come together with the leaders on the great iron ship from Australia. But these children were very mysterious; they were almost never seen in public places.

Currently there were fewer than ten "young transmigrators" studying at Fangcao Di, ranging from seven or eight to twelve or thirteen years old. They received specialized combined-grade education in a specially established class at the Study Academy—though called combined-grade education, it wasn't much different from one-on-one.

Their learning content was deeper than the fast-track students, especially with greater depth and breadth in natural and humanities sciences. Additionally, each had to elect a commonly-used foreign language from the old time-space, to ensure the Grand Library's various foreign language materials could be effectively passed down.

However, within the Study Academy, these students were not permitted to be called "Leader." Anyone inside the Academy could only address them by name; students privately all called them "those people."

Dai Dehou saw that the newcomer was a female student. Judging by her face, she was only eleven or twelve, but her height was a head taller than most thirteen or fourteen-year-old boys here. Her figure was slender; she wore the same style uniform as other students, with long hair bound by a pink ribbon. Her features were beautiful, her complexion fair.

Once she entered, she greeted a few girls she knew, then walked with light steps to the food counter to get her meal. Her every move, every smile, radiated a quality completely different from his own daughter—natural and unaffected, full of confidence, like a rising sun. Everyone's gaze immediately concentrated on her.

Truly born noble. Dai Dehou thought enviously. His own daughter had become ever more spirited since coming here to study, but compared to this one, there was no contest...

He wondered who this transmigrator family's daughter would marry someday...

Dai Dehou's daydream was soon interrupted by his wife's words: "Whose family's daughter is that?"

"A transmigrator family's, obviously. Even if I told you, you wouldn't know..."

This was true. The transmigrators whose names Dai Dehou knew numbered at most a dozen or so, mostly learned through broadcasts and newspapers.

"So what rank is that girl..." His wife now also regarded these overall evaluations as sacred.

"They don't participate in overall evaluations. They're so impressive—if they did, we'd all be washing their feet..."

"Washing feet?"

"Hmm... Anyway, Mother, you wouldn't understand."

Dai Dehou looked at his daughter, now laughing and pouting, and suddenly felt she had become a stranger. Where was any trace of the old San'niang? Her way of speaking and her demeanor were very similar to the transmigrator family's daughter just now...

Soon the meal was finished. Dai Yan returned the empty trays and milk bottles. After the meal, parents and children would have half an hour together.

Seeing that his wife and daughter had talked enough, Dai Dehou considered carefully before finally speaking.

"Yan-er, has Leader Luo been by?"

The one who had recommended his daughter to study here was Leader Luo. But Dai Dehou wasn't a naturalized citizen. He still hadn't figured out Leader Luo's full name, let alone what office he held or how much authority he had. Actually, apart from the chance encounter at East Gate Market, he had never seen him again. His daughter's recommendation had been arranged through Third Brother, but that leader reportedly worked in some restricted area. They hadn't been able to meet this mysterious leader in person and had only passed along a letter.

"He comes every week! He brings me lots of treats and tells me to study hard!"

Mentioning Leader Luo, Dai Yan seemed to remember something. With a secretive air, she fished some candies out of her uniform pocket and handed them to her mother.

"Mother, take these back for little brother. These are milk candies the leader gave me—they're not sold outside!"

Seeing her daughter's innocent look, he couldn't get more out of her, so Dai Dehou didn't press further.

Time spent together was always too short. Teacher Xu soon stood up and announced that visiting class was about to end. Spring break would begin in a few days; she hoped parents would pay attention to their children's safety. Then she said a few words about the leaders thanking all parents for their support and promising to nurture their children into capable people—platitudes. Finally, she handed out each student's report card to the visiting parents. This was now the best thing to show off to neighbors.

Dai Dehou and his wife left the school. There was still an hour before his work shift, but he had already requested time off.

The two boarded the train. Dai Dehou kept thinking over his calculations.

He wondered if Leader Luo had taken a fancy to his daughter Yan-er? No matter how dear a daughter was, she would have to marry eventually. Besides, becoming Leader Luo's concubine would be the daughter's good fortune. If they could make connections with Leader Luo, perhaps their son could also enter this National School—perhaps the other party could even put in a word about their housing situation.

Of course, he wasn't confident. As things stood, he had no house, no business, and couldn't even afford a proper dowry. Besides, marrying off a daughter was a bit early; he'd heard Australia had no custom of child betrothals, and female leaders particularly disliked it.

"Husband, do you think if we asked Leader Luo, would he also recommend Yu-er for school?" His wife, looking through the report card, suddenly spoke up.

"Huh?" Dai Dehou hadn't yet collected his thoughts. "How would I know..."

"How about we write a letter and have Yan-er deliver it to Leader Luo when she returns to school after break?"

"That's a good idea!"

Dai Dehou suddenly perked up. Holding his wife's hand, he felt the whole family's future now had hope.

"Director Zhang, your progress here isn't good."

Yang Yun and Zhang Xingpei, along with Dai Xiu, life secretary, apprentice, and guards, had just returned to the command post from the Majiao New District under construction.

Though the land plot adjacent to the highway had already been leveled, the thirty buildings scattered across it were still mostly at the foundation-digging stage after three months of construction. Only a few buildings near the highway had risen to two floors. At this pace, Yang Yun's drafted new round of housing distribution plan would be nothing but an empty promise.

"If you want faster progress, either give me people or give me equipment. There are lots of rocks underground here—the explosives allocated to me aren't even enough."

Zhang Xingpei reclined in his beach chair, enjoying the hot towel his life secretary had just brought for washing his face. His tone was lazy.

The grand ambitions he'd had upon taking office had long been worn down by reality. Civil Construction had a full set of native cadres, plus most workers being the dregs and greenhorns rejected by the main construction company. Though they'd organized plenty of temporary workers to help, progress was still sluggish, with accidents one after another.

Every day at work, Zhang Xingpei spent most of his energy yelling at people. But after yelling too much, he'd grown weary.

"How about this—I'll add a thousand workers for you, but you must guarantee the deadline!"

"You have extra manpower on your end?"

Zhang Xingpei was somewhat puzzled. Currently what Lingao lacked most was manpower. As the operation kept expanding, it was needed everywhere—especially technical personnel, which every department was fighting over.
