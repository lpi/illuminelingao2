# Chapter 1072 - Borrowing Troops to Suppress the Rebels

Finally, Sun Yuanhua boarded the Type 901 gunboat *Daishuang*.

Although the hull of the *Daishuang* was not much larger than the largest special service boat, the ship's shape, equipment, and the special service boats, which were born from Chinese civilian ships, were distinctly different. In particular, the rigging—the 901 used not the improved Sino-Western hybrid rigging of the special service boat, but a Barquentine rig. Sun Yuanhua browsed for a long time, feeling that this ship's form and rigging were somewhat similar to the European-style sailing ships shown to him by missionaries, but it looked lighter and more beautiful than European sailing ships.

Although Sun Yuanhua didn't verify the saying "an aircraft with superior performance must be beautiful," he instinctively felt that the Australians' ship had far superior performance to European ships.

What left the deepest impression on him was the 130mm Grenshiel "Giant Cannon" on the *Daishuang*. When the canvas was uncovered and the bottle-shaped, glittering cannon was exposed to his gaze, Sun Yuanhua suddenly realized that all the "Heavy Weapons of the State" he had seen before appeared so pale and powerless.

The 68-pounder carronade certainly gave him a big shock, but with his artillery cultivation, he knew that while a cannon with a shorter barrel could fire a very large shot, the range would not be very far.

But this "Giant Cannon" before him not only had a large caliber but also a long barrel, combining power and range. What amazed him even more was that the seemingly very heavy cannon could rotate freely with ease—without even needing manual labor. At Lu Yang's command, several sailors ran to their gun positions simultaneously. Someone operated a brass lever, turned a handwheel, and a strange low-pitched whirring sound came from the deck beneath the cannon, followed by the rotation of the heavy cannon body.

Suddenly, thick white steam sprayed out from under the deck and inside the gun carriage, startling Sun Yuanhua. A gust of sea breeze blew past, and the water vapor quickly dissipated. He could clearly see the cannon rotating left and right and elevating freely under the manipulation of a few sailors. Agile as a chopstick.

*This one warship alone is worth ten fleet ships of the Navy!* Sun Yuanhua thought. *No wonder the Australians can roam the seas freely!*

"With such a giant cannon, and without using manpower, how can it turn freely?" he asked.

"This is the power of water and fire." Lu Yang simply explained the principle of the steam engine. He used the explanation from *One Hundred Thousand Whys*—explaining the power of steam from the common phenomenon of steam lifting the lid of a kettle when boiling water for cooking.

Sun Yuanhua listened very seriously. The principle of the steam engine was actually very simple, but transforming this principle into usable power was not a simple matter. So he didn't pursue how the power of steam moved the cannon—presumably, it was a secret art of the Australians, and they would never easily show it to others.

"What is this again?" Sun Yuanhua came to the huge funnel in the middle of the hull. The funnel was wrapped in fishing nets and tarpaulins.

"A chimney."

"A chimney?" Sun Yuanhua marveled. "Such a big chimney?"

Any large ship had a stove, but he had never heard of a stove so big it needed a chimney installed.

"Exactly," Lu Yang said. "Since the power of water and fire is used, this chimney is necessary."

"So, beneath this deck is a huge stove?"

"Sir guessed correctly; it is exactly a huge stove, and a pot of water."

This aroused Sun Yuanhua's intense curiosity even more: He couldn't figure out for the life of him how a huge stove could be built in such a rocking environment on a ship, and how a pot of water could be placed on it. Wouldn't the water spill over as soon as the ship sailed?

While he was puzzled, he saw a small boat emitting black smoke and white steam sailing in the bay.

There were large patches of floating ice inside Longkou Bay. A *Dafa* launch was transporting laborers to break the ice manually on the ice surface to maintain the channel's smoothness.

Sun Yuanhua suddenly noticed that this small boat sailing in the bay had no sails or oars, and he couldn't help but be greatly surprised—he had long heard that Australian ships could sail without sails or oars, and now seeing was believing. Looking at the black smoke and water vapor constantly rising from the small boat and the chimney on top, he suddenly understood and asked:

"This boat moves freely on the sea; I fear it also uses the power of water and fire mentioned by Mr. Lu, right?"

"Sir is correct." Lu Yang admired secretly.

" This ship here, although it has sails, can also sail without using sails, right?"

"Yes," Lu Yang said. "The power of water and fire can push cannons, propel ships, and do many, many other things."

Sun Yuanhua sighed: "Truly a skill of gods and ghosts!"

"Isn't Sir most skilled in the study of Gewu (Investigation of Things)?" Lu Yang said. "The Way of water and fire is also the study of Gewu."

On the way back to the stockade. "Borrowing troops to help suppress!" This term suddenly jumped into Sun Yuanhua's heart.

The other party openly revealed their warships and cannons; he naturally understood that this was an intentional hint to him.

After being captured in Dengzhou, he had originally despaired of his future—given the Emperor's consistent style of handling things: even if Kong Youde released him out of old feelings, and even if he returned to the Court with the help of his teacher and Grand Secretary Zhou, he feared he could not escape death.

Originally, he was prepared to die, but now he had been rescued again: Dengzhou had only fallen for two or three days, and neither the Imperial Court nor the local government would have received precise news...

As long as a person in a desperate situation had a glimmer of a turn for the better, there would immediately be a strong desire to survive. Sun Yuanhua immediately realized: A huge opportunity was appearing before his eyes.

If he could lead troops to defeat Kong Youde and recover Dengzhou, even if the position of Governor couldn't be kept, at least there would be a possibility of reinstatement in the future.

As for the other party being "Short-haired Thieves," this was a slight concern. But judging by looks, the other party didn't want to reveal their true identity either, otherwise they wouldn't have bothered to build a manor here under a fake name to operate.

Back in the stockade, Jean Nicholas invited him to attend morning Mass. The Mass was held in a simple large shed on the island, attended mainly by new converts among the refugees. Since Lu Wenyuan was already a Catholic, he had to go along to the service.

After the service ended, Sun Yuanhua and Jean Nicholas had another conversation. Jean Nicholas expressed concern about his current state, indicating that his failure in Dengzhou would not only endanger himself but could also be a very huge blow to the propagation of the Holy Church in China.

Sun Yuanhua naturally understood the meaning expressed by the Church. The Jesuits' missionary work in China relied heavily on upper-class scholar-officials. But at the moment, there were few scholar-official Christians who could be called "high officials." His mentor Xu Guangqi was already in his declining years and exhausted from revising the calendar. He himself was the missionaries' last hope.

Then, Jean Nicholas talked at length about the Australians' piety towards the Church and how the Church had achieved unprecedented harvest in Hainan with the support of the Australians—he pointed out with great regret: If the leader of the Australians were a Christian, the Pope would definitely canonize him.

Under the guidance of the Jesuit priest, Sun Yuan had the intention of "Borrowing Troops to Help Suppress."

However, he still had many things to clarify. First was how many troops the Australians could dispatch. Sun Yuanhua knew that Dengzhou faced Liaodong across the sea, and the local area was poor and destitute. After Kong Youde occupied Dengzhou, he had grain, pay, and weapons. As long as he raised a big banner, he wouldn't worry about immediately gathering tens of thousands of men and horses.

Of these tens of thousands, the majority would naturally be people looking for a bite to eat and a way to survive, but among them, there would be no lack of local soldier ruffians and old Dongjiang men.

Although these soldiers lost more than they won against the Tartars, they were "strong soldiers" in the Great Ming army. Especially since Li Jiucheng, Kong Youde, and others were veteran generals of Liaodong and had undergone Western firearms training in Dengzhou. If it really came to a fight, unless the Court transferred elite border troops guarding the capital from the Shanhaiguan area, troops merely cobbled together temporarily might not be their match.

Especially the large amount of firearms and gunpowder stored in Dengzhou City added to their combat power. Furthermore, there were warships in the Water City. This was what Sun Yuanhua was particularly worried about.

If the naval warships all fell into the hands of the rebel army, it meant they had the ability to maneuver freely on the sea. The Dongjiang Army in rushun and the islands of Liaodong could echo the rebels in Dengzhou via the sea route at any time.

When the time came, the momentum of the rebel army would roll larger and larger like a snowball, and if the rebel army couldn't hold on, it was also possible they would take to the sea to defect to the Tartars... The Dengzhou-Laizhou defense line that the Court had painstakingly managed for ten years would collapse.

Facing such a formidable enemy, Sun Yuanhua certainly couldn't count on his small number of troops in Laizhou and Qingzhou to suppress them—even with the troops sent by Shandong Governor Yu Dacheng, he had no chance of winning.

Sun Yuanhua didn't expect the Court to send reinforcements quickly. The Court's military strength in the north was tight. To send an army to suppress, even if the Court deliberation passed immediately, it would take at least three or four months.

His plan was to defend Laizhou and Qingzhou to the death, preventing the chaos of the rebel army from spreading. Asking the Australian navy to assist in battle at sea would prevent the rebels from colluding with the old Dongjiang men in Liaodong.

If the old Dongjiang men couldn't cross the sea to reinforce Kong Youde, and they couldn't take Laizhou and Qingzhou, the rebels could only be trapped in Dengzhou—the grain in Dengzhou could probably support them for about half a year. As long as they were trapped for half a year, the rebels would fall into chaos without fighting. At that time, whether offering amnesty or the Court amassing a large army to encircle and suppress, half the effort would yield twice the result.

Sun Yuanhua didn't hold much hope for the Australian army—he only saw village braves on the island. Even if there were some Australian soldiers, at most there would be two or three hundred. Even with legendary excellent firearms, their numbers were too few, not even enough to fill the gaps between the rebels' teeth.

In contrast, he had much more confidence in the Australian navy—locking down Dengzhou with the warships the Australians showed him would be as easy as turning over a hand. Neither the Dongjiang Navy nor the Dengzhou Navy had warships that could oppose them. If a fight really started, it would truly be what was called smashing dry weeds and rotten wood.

However, making this determination was not easy—the Australians were "Short-haired Thieves" who had seen battle with the Court's army after all. Although they were only doing business so far and hadn't revealed any ambition, showing goodness to him for no reason couldn't help but make him suspicious.
