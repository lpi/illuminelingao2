# Chapter 833: News from Hongji Station

Hainan Island did not produce silk products—these were the goods the Dutch loved most. Skaed thought, perhaps we can also follow the example of the Dutch and engage in intermediary trade. Import silk fabrics and porcelain from the mainland on a large scale, then sell them to the Dutch. The Dutch had long suffered from Zheng Zhilong's strict blockade of coastal trade. Because of the monopoly, the silk fabrics Zheng Zhilong sold to the Dutch were very expensive, unable to satisfy the Dutch desire for super profits.

What if we sold to the Dutch? Skaed thought of this idea. As long as the price is slightly cheaper, the Dutch will come to Lingao to purchase silk. Or just have them go to Sanya Port to trade directly.

Of course, considering that the Ming Empire itself also had a large demand for spices, having the Dutch bring spices was also a way to fill the gap in Lingao's export materials. Since the Dutch used violence to monopolize the spice exports of the Moluccas, the prices of the spices they sold had been very expensive. However, since people like Zheng Zhilong were still willing to accept Dutch spices as trade goods, obviously the profits from selling them to the mainland were still considerable. We can make this profit too!

Skaed held a pencil and scribbled on paper, thinking about how to force the Dutch to sign an unequal treaty and how to make the terms of the treaty as favorable to their side as possible. After all, the quarantine period would end tomorrow.

Just as he was racking his brain, the phone rang again: someone reported that a telegram had arrived from Hongji Station.

"The trading post in Hongji has been attacked by bandits!" The voice on the phone said urgently.

"What?!" Skaed cried out involuntarily. The female secretary who was always waiting outside the door immediately pushed the door and came in. Skaed waved at her to leave. "What happened? Are there any casualties?"

"The specific situation is unclear. The telegram says the trading post is currently safe and the bandits have been repelled," the native clerk in charge of exchanging information said nervously on the phone.

"Send the telegram up immediately. Hurry!" What Skaed was most worried about was the safety of Hongji Station—after all, developing Hongji was something he had strongly advocated. If anything happened to Hongji, such as Beikai being killed or captured by the monkeys, he wouldn't be able to be reelected as the Minister of Colonization and Trade. At most, he could only continue to be the Chief Secretary of the Department of Colonization and Trade.

The telegram was immediately delivered by a clerk who came running. Skaed grabbed the slip and saw that there were very few words on it. Not many more words than the clerk had described.

"What kind of telegram is this! It doesn't explain anything!" Skaed went crazy. "Quick, telegraph to inquire about the specific situation at Hongji Station. Do they need reinforcements immediately?"

Skaed issued instructions rapid-fire, while grabbing the phone: "Connect me to the Naval Command!"

Beikai had spent nearly two months in Yalong Bay.

During these two months, he truly ran things for the first time, free from direct leadership command—at first, he was really a bit uncomfortable, but as time went on, he became more and more into the role.

The first week was the hardest to get through. He stayed in an earthen fort with 30 marines, 1 life secretary, and 5 prisoners. This life secretary hadn't drawn a Class C or above ticket at the time and originally thought buying Class C would be no problem. But when he leisurely went to "inspect the goods," he bitterly discovered that Class C had been bought out, and even Class D had few left. Beikai just bought one that was passable with the attitude of better than nothing. At least the life secretaries had all received special training and were more pleasant than the female naturalized citizens from the quarantine camps.

On this deserted beach, besides the 36 people, all that could be seen were the wild mountains covered with overgrown grass. Although Yalong Bay was picturesque, in Beikai's view, it looked equally ferocious—more than once, he sized up the captured pirate fishing boat that Yan Maoda had left them when he departed, estimating whether this boat could safely bring them to Haiyang in case something happened—he felt it was a bit risky to cross the Gulf of Tonkin.

The *Zhennan* was originally said to return in three or four days but actually took a full week. Zhang Dabala's return with the *Zhennan* put Beikai's mind at ease—this old pirate was very familiar with the situation in Vietnam, and now he had such a ship with considerable combat power. Ordinary bandits and pirates were nothing to fear.

The *Zhennan* brought a lot of rice and daily necessities from Haiyang, and also brought him more than a hundred gaunt Beiqi farmers. These were all farmers who had fled due to the Northern Court's extortionate levies, taxes, and conscription. Yan Maoda had recruited all of them at a very low cost.

This batch of Beiqi farmers and the five pirate prisoners became the first batch of miners for the Hongji coal mine. Beikai now had enough grain, tools, and building materials in the warehouse, and immediately launched large-scale construction in Hongji.

Beikai organized the miners to set up a separate labor camp outside the bastion. The housing was simple semi-underground huts. A ditch was dug outside as a simple defensive measure.

The miners immediately threw themselves into excavating Cat Shit Mine No. 1. Each worker dug with the tools Beikai issued, loading the coal into baskets and transporting it to the seaside with Purple Lightning wheelbarrows, piling it in the open space next to the wharf to wait for shipment. Although Yan Maoda hadn't instructed him to start mining coal immediately, Beikai believed that if he could ensure the first ship from Lingao didn't go back empty, it would be of great benefit to improving his reputation value in the Senate.

Beikai found that a miner using simple iron tools could dig 50 kilograms per hour and carry it to the storage yard with a back basket or wheelbarrow. Even if a miner worked 10 hours a day, each person's daily coal output could reach half a ton.

After another week, two transport ships from the Dabo Shipping Company arrived in Hongji. Besides bringing more building materials and tools, they also brought a hundred naturalized citizen laborers. These laborers would be used as the core force of Hongji Station. Besides basic manual laborers, there were also a small number of trained clerks, medics, and some technical workers among them, including blacksmiths and carpenters.

With the workforce doubled, work progressed even faster. Workers built a wooden pier using prefabricated components. The original earthen fort was also expanded—a second earthen embankment and ditch were built around the earthen fort. The newly enclosed area of the earthen embankment was greatly enlarged, forming a so-called "outer fort." Housing for naturalized citizen workers, administrative facilities, and warehouses were set up inside the outer fort. Six 24-pounder cannons were also unloaded from the ship, and all naturalized citizen workers were equipped with the militia standard kit: helmets, standard spears, and machetes, greatly increasing Beikai's sense of security.

When the Dabo Shipping ships departed, they loaded over a hundred tons of anthracite. Although the quantity was small, it had great symbolic significance. Skaed made a big deal of it at the Executive Committee meeting and Senate sessions. The news even made the *Lingao Times*. After Beikai received this news, he had mixed feelings: now he had to "produce coal to serve the country" here.

With naturalized citizen workers and indigenous managers as the backbone, Beikai reorganized the workflow. Naturalized citizen workers immediately began building a light railway, extending from the coal storage yard to Cat Shit Mine No. 1. Running on it were ore tipping wagons shipped from Lingao. Miners now worked in teams, greatly improving efficiency: a 3-person team using iron shovels to dig coal could quickly fill the 200kg-load tipping wagons. And one person could quickly move this cart of coal to the storage yard. With 3 cart workers and 3 shovel workers, based on a 10-hour workday, they could produce 7-8 tons of coal. On average, about 200 people, including naturalized citizen workers, were working at the mine. Daily coal output could reach over 250 tons. This coal output was already enough for Dabo Shipping to open a dedicated coal shipping line. The *Qionghai Coal*, this large ship, finally did its namesake work and became a dedicated coal transport ship.

The surge in coal shipments made loading and unloading at Hongji another bottleneck. The *Qionghai Coal* soon brought steam engines, boilers, and bucket elevators. Then, to supply workers with clean drinking water, a large fixed water filter was also sent over.

Then more naturalized citizen workers were sent—the development of Hongji snowballed. After the scale expanded, demand for manpower in all aspects emerged. People were needed to build houses, construct tracks, maintain machinery, load and unload cargo, even cook... By the end of February 1631, the number of laborers in Hongji had expanded to 600. More than 200 of them were naturalized citizens, and the others were recruited locally from Beiqi. Many people who couldn't bear the weight of taxes and conscription were sent here from the recruitment station in Haiyang. Some came after hearing the news, trekking over mountains on their own.

The constantly increasing Beiqi miners and their families soon formed a crude settlement outside the outer fort. The settlement was surrounded by a ditch and bamboo fences sharpened at the top for protection. Between the miners' settlement and the outer fort was a path paved with coal cinders and gangue. Beside the path, the Cooperative opened a large cafeteria—to improve worker efficiency and make full use of the labor force, letting them cook for themselves was obviously a waste of time; there were also small restaurants offering higher-end food and alcohol, and Cooperative stores selling various goods—the surge in miners attracted the Commerce Department. Li Mei personally came to Hongji to open a Cooperative branch following the Nanbao model. Besides selling various goods, they handled remittance business. The main purpose was to promote the use of circulation vouchers.

In another direction from Hongji Fort and the miners' settlement, there was a small settlement. It was specifically for housing newly recruited locals—this was Hongji Station's quarantine camp. People in the quarantine camp enjoyed free meals, and their job was road construction, to ensure they had no contact with other miners.
