# Chapter 161: Military Uniforms

Training continued—but food was surprisingly good. "Chiefs" had no concept of coarse grains. Three meals daily, unlimited brown rice, one salted fish per person, plus many vegetables. Initially several young men overate until their eyes rolled back. Ancient people rarely got sufficient protein and fat—so carbohydrate demand was especially high. Farmers during busy seasons commonly ate 2-*jin* flatbread per meal. These soldiers doing high-volume daily training naturally weren't exceptions. Ma Qianzhu quickly discovered 20kg monthly rations wouldn't last. But no solution—unless meat and oil supplies increased. Transmigrators themselves lacked these.

Drills continued. First quick-march, then parade-march, then running. After footwork training completion—marching to drum and fife rhythms. Per PLA training manuals, after completion soldiers would do 110–120 steps/minute quick-march and parade-march, 180–190 steps/minute running—already the world's fastest for that era.

Better food and physical training transformed these sallow, thin people into robust strength. Actually, regarding endurance and load-bearing, these long-term hard-labor workers exceeded transmigrators—but that was pathological adaptation, not current healthy strength from adequate food and exercise.

Soldiers' physiques improved. Through drill training, mental bearing greatly changed. Long-term chest out, chin up, striding walk, decisive speech gave them confident, capable expressions. Non-enlisted workers now envied these soldiers. Commune women often lingered near the training grounds.

"With good-looking uniforms—even more impressive." Ma Qianzhu discovered Army lacked a logistics department—this Chief of Staff became Logistics Chief alongside training.

Uniform design solicitation immediately sparked transmigrator excitement. In this dreary environment, entertainment value. Soon Ma Qianzhu collected 100+ assorted sketches: from distinctive Type-65, to Frederick's mitered grenadiers, Napoleon's bearskin guard, British lobsterbacks, Budyonov-capped Soviet Red Army, to Wehrmacht... Everyone's uniform fetishes collected.

After compiling, Ma Qianzhu sadly discovered: no creativity. All historical army reproductions. Three main schools: First—Chinese traditional (Type-65 representative, mixed with Type-55/Type-87); Second—line infantry enthusiasts using 19th-century European uniforms emphasizing gorgeous flashiness; Third—WWII school basically copying German/Soviet/American uniforms, some hybrid monsters. Also niche preferences: National Revolutionary Army round caps, even Shōwa-era IJA uniform enthusiasts.

"Good heavens—did Japanophiles infiltrate?" Ma Qianzhu gasped.

Given widespread interest, Ma Qianzhu couldn't decide unilaterally. Democracy's benefit: nobody takes responsibility. He convened a "hearing"—Military Committee, Industrial Department, Planning Committee, plus 10 citizen representatives—reviewing all proposals.

To avoid personal aesthetic influence, Ma Qianzhu established two principles: uniforms can't exceed current production capability; uniforms must suit the local environment.

This immediately eliminated bearskin caps, riding boots—half the candidates gone. Then production capability. The Industrial Department reported: per investigation, Lingao's indigenous dyeing could only produce gray, blue, and black. Lingao produced no wool. The line infantry party was completely eliminated. Colorful elaborate uniforms were impractical.

Remaining candidates were modern uniforms. Type-65 won—simple manufacturing, fabric-saving. To placate others—new uniforms had some modifications.

New uniform designated "Year-One Pattern," also called "28-Pattern." Like Type-65, based on Zhongshan suit using cotton fabric. Officers' four pockets versus enlisted two pockets inherited. Cap changed to octagonal cap—slightly larger than the Red Army's small octagon, more American-style, looking fashionable.

Collar insignia and cap badges left blank for now. Anticipating future ranks, the Year-One Pattern had pre-installed shoulder straps; the left arm had an armband position. Officers and soldiers all used German infantry style fabric gaiters—no more wrapping dumplings with cloth strips. Just slip on and tighten—convenient. Military shoes: two types—straw sandals for training, black cloth shoes for outings and reviews.

For batch production, uniforms weren't Army/Navy-specific—just color-differentiated: Army gray, Navy blue. Not navy blue or sky blue—a blackish indigo. Navy currently had low standards—just differentiation from Army.

Considering Hainan's hot weather, summer uniforms were designed—just short-sleeve versions using hemp fabric. Someone proposed knee-length shorts—but British colonial troops' ugly pathetic appearance was immediately rejected.

Beyond uniforms: regulation underpants, undershirts, blankets. Blankets weren't wool—just two cotton layers with light cotton fill, grid-stitched. In Hainan's year-round 20°C+ temperatures—sufficient.

Transmigrators had ample cotton stockpile. Only 5 sewing machines; worse, only 3 women could operate them. Expecting them to make 1,200 uniform sets was impractical. Ma Qianzhu decided: outsource to Commune women. Nearly all could tailor—commoners rarely used tailors, women made clothes themselves. Skill wasn't difficult. If unfamiliar with modern patterns—no problem. Logistics had prepared paper patterns distributed with fabric. Just trace and copy. Before distribution, the Planning Committee had trial-produced one set of each size and style—checking fit and calculating fabric and thread consumption to prevent over- or under-supply.

Wu De quickly assigned work—establishing acceptance standards. Rejects required compensation fabric. This outsourcing earned work points plus leftover fabric for contractors—greatly motivating Commune women. Even those with regular jobs worked overnight shifts. Wu De planned using this opportunity to discover skilled seamstresses—train them professionally, then open a Commune garment factory, taking over sewing and cutting equipment. Big business—beyond military: future schools, agencies, once migrants arrived, clothing demand would surge.

Equipment was simpler. The county's only leatherworker—hearing short-hairs sought leatherworkers for large orders—immediately brought his family and tools to join. First assignment stunned him speechless: 1,200 leather belts. This generosity completely won him over—developing the simple conviction: "Following short-hair masters guarantees food forever."

Weapon belts were German-style Y-straps in cowhide. After inspecting Wei Aiwen's replica Y-strap, the leatherworker deemed it easy—the whole family could produce 10 daily. Metal buckles were stamped by the Mechanical Group from wrought iron—steel was too precious. However, Wei Aiwen traded cigarettes for private work—some brass buckles.

Lin Fu nervously stood outside the office. This Salt Village rugby star had enlisted. Though Xi Yazhou hadn't assigned village quotas—only requiring demonstration militiamen—the Village Committee decided these demonstrators should enlist, showing Salt Village's determination to follow "Chiefs" in "revolution." This term came from Du Wen. What was revolution? Nobody knew. Salt Village had no literati—otherwise they'd be terrified.

Lin Fu wasn't tall—about 165cm—but respectable for that era. Long-term rugby training gave him robust build—naturally becoming a reference soldier. Now fully equipped in future New Army configuration for Military and Planning Committee review.

"Lin Fu, come in." Chief of Staff Ma's voice came from inside. Lin Fu didn't know what Chief of Staff meant—understood he was the training ground's highest ranking. Pushed open the door—startled.

Large room. Horseshoe arrangement long tables. A dozen "Chiefs" all staring at him in the center—like three-court examination scenes from operas.

Lin Fu performed Wei Aiwen's taught salute, loudly reporting:

"Report! Army Training Battalion, 1st Company, 1st Platoon, 1st Squad, Reference Soldier Lin Fu reporting as ordered!"

Wei Aiwen stood, returned salute: "At ease!"

"Yes sir!"

Proper exchange. This week's training wasn't wasted. Everyone showed approving expressions. Before them: soldier holding Year-One Minié rifle, Year-One triangular bayonet attached, wearing Year-One uniform, cowhide German-style Y-strap, waist carrying one large and one small ammunition pouch. Quite imposing.

"This is imitation Taishō-11 ammunition pouch. Dimensions modified." Wei Aiwen explained. "Cowhide. Two sizes—large for paper cartridges, 60 rounds each. Small for percussion caps." Caps were sensitive—stored separately from cartridges. Pouches were designed for future compatibility with metal cartridges—universal sizing.

"This is canteen." Wei Aiwen pointed at the cylindrical object on Lin Fu's waist. "Made from bamboo. Cork stopper. Net rope sleeve attaches to belt. Doesn't it resemble German gas mask canisters?"

Indeed it did. Everyone nodded. Wei Aiwen seemed proud of this "German element."

Belt held a fabric grenade pouch containing the Chemistry Group's bamboo-shell grenades—weaker power but impressive effect, useful for intimidation.

Lin Fu wore a peculiar backpack—more like a flat box than a pack. This was the newly developed regulation backbox. Inspired by locals' common backbaskets—woven from fine rattan, interior lined with tung-oiled cloth, lid-equipped, waterproof. Elliptical shape with ergonomic backframe.

This newly developed backbasket matched current industrial capability while far exceeding traditional bundles—a new product combining modern concepts with contemporary production.
