# Chapter 161: Military Uniforms

Training continued, but the food was surprisingly good. The "Chiefs" had no concept of coarse grains. There were three meals daily, with unlimited brown rice, one salted fish per person, plus a large quantity of vegetables. Initially, several young men overate until their eyes rolled back. Ancient people rarely got sufficient protein and fat, so their demand for carbohydrates was especially high. During busy seasons, farmers commonly ate two *jin* of flatbread per meal. These soldiers, doing high-volume daily training, naturally weren't exceptions. Ma Qianzhu quickly discovered that twenty kilograms of monthly rations wouldn't last. But there was no solution unless meat and oil supplies increased. The transmigrators themselves lacked these basic supplies.

Drills continued. First quick-march, then parade-march, then running. After footwork training was completed, they marched to drum and fife rhythms. According to PLA training manuals, after completing their training, soldiers would perform 110–120 steps per minute for quick-march and parade-march, and 180–190 steps per minute for running—already the world's fastest for that era.

Better food and physical training transformed these sallow, thin people into men of robust strength. In fact, regarding endurance and load-bearing, these lifelong manual laborers exceeded the transmigrators—but that was a pathological adaptation, not the current healthy strength derived from adequate food and exercise.

The soldiers' physiques improved, and through drill training, their mental bearing underwent a significant change. Maintaining a posture with chests out and chins up, along with a striding walk and decisive speech for a prolonged period, gave them confident and capable expressions. The non-enlisted workers now envied these soldiers. Commune women often lingered near the training grounds.

"With good-looking uniforms, they'd be even more impressive." Ma Qianzhu discovered the Army lacked a logistics department—so this Chief of Staff became the Logistics Chief alongside his training duties.

The solicitation for uniform designs immediately sparked excitement among the transmigrators. In this dreary environment, it had entertainment value. Soon, Ma Qianzhu collected over a hundred assorted sketches: from the distinctive Type-65 to Frederick's mitered grenadiers, Napoleon's bearskin guard, British "lobsterbacks," the Budyonov-capped Soviet Red Army, and even the Wehrmacht... everyone's uniform fetishes were collected.

After compiling them, Ma Qianzhu sadly discovered a lack of creativity. All were historical army reproductions. There were three main schools of thought: First, the traditional Chinese style (represented by the Type-65, mixed with Type-55 and Type-87); Second, the line infantry enthusiasts using 19th-century European uniforms emphasizing gorgeous flashiness; Third, the WWII school, basically copying German, Soviet, and American uniforms, with some hybrid monsters. There were also niche preferences: National Revolutionary Army round caps, and even Shōwa-era IJA uniform enthusiasts.

"Good heavens—did Japanophiles infiltrate?" Ma Qianzhu gasped.

Given the widespread interest, Ma Qianzhu couldn't decide unilaterally. The benefit of democracy was that nobody took responsibility. He convened a "hearing"—including the Military Committee, Industrial Department, Planning Committee, plus ten citizen representatives—to review all proposals.

To avoid personal aesthetic influence, Ma Qianzhu established two principles: uniforms couldn't exceed current production capabilities, and uniforms had to suit the local environment.

This immediately eliminated bearskin caps and riding boots—half the candidates were gone. Then came production capability. The Industrial Department reported that, per investigation, Lingao's indigenous dyeing could only produce gray, blue, and black. Lingao produced no wool. The line infantry party was completely eliminated. Colorful, elaborate uniforms were impractical.

The remaining candidates were modern uniforms. The Type-65 won due to its simple manufacturing and fabric-saving design. To placate the others, the new uniforms included some modifications.

The new uniform was designated the "Year-One Pattern," also called the "28-Pattern." Like the Type-65, it was based on the Zhongshan suit using cotton fabric. The officer's four pockets versus the enlisted man's two pockets was a feature inherited from established designs. The cap changed to an octagonal cap—slightly larger than the Red Army's small octagon, and more American-style, looking fashionable.

Collar insignia and cap badges were left blank for now. Anticipating future ranks, the Year-One Pattern had pre-installed shoulder straps; the left arm had a position for an armband. Officers and soldiers all used German infantry-style fabric gaiters—no more wrapping "dumplings" with cloth strips. They could just slip them on and tighten them—it was convenient. Military shoes came in two types: straw sandals for training, and black cloth shoes for outings and reviews.

For batch production, uniforms weren't specific to the Army or Navy—they were just color-differentiated: Army gray, Navy blue. Not navy blue or sky blue—a blackish indigo. The Navy currently had low standards; they just wanted differentiation from the Army.

Considering Hainan's hot weather, summer uniforms were designed—just short-sleeve versions using hemp fabric. Someone proposed knee-length shorts, but the ugly, pathetic appearance of British colonial troops led to the idea's immediate rejection.

Beyond uniforms, there were regulation underpants, undershirts, and blankets. The blankets weren't wool—just two cotton layers with light cotton fill, grid-stitched. In Hainan's year-round 20°C+ temperatures, that was sufficient.

The transmigrators had an ample cotton stockpile. However, there were only five sewing machines; worse, only three women could operate them. Expecting them to make 1,200 uniform sets was impractical. Ma Qianzhu decided to outsource to the women of the Commune. Nearly all of them could tailor—commoners rarely used tailors, as women made clothes themselves. The skill wasn't difficult. If they were unfamiliar with modern patterns—no problem. Logistics had prepared paper patterns distributed with the fabric. They just had to trace and copy. Before distribution, the Planning Committee had trial-produced one set of each size and style, checking the fit and calculating fabric and thread consumption to prevent over- or under-supply.

Wu De quickly assigned the work and established acceptance standards. Rejects required compensation for the fabric. This outsourcing earned work points plus leftover fabric for the contractors—greatly motivating the Commune women. Even those with regular jobs worked overnight shifts and Wu De planned to use this opportunity to discover skilled seamstresses. He aimed to train them professionally and then open a Commune garment factory, taking over sewing and cutting equipment. It was big business—beyond the military, future schools and agencies would need uniforms, and once migrants arrived, clothing demand would surge.

Equipment was simpler. The county's only leatherworker, hearing that the "short-hairs" sought craftsmen for large orders, immediately brought his family and tools to join. His first assignment stunned him into silence: 1,200 leather belts. This generosity completely won him over—he developed the simple conviction: "Following the short-hair masters guarantees food forever."

The weapon belts were German-style Y-straps made of cowhide. After inspecting Wei Aiwen's replica Y-strap, the leatherworker deemed it easy—the whole family could produce ten daily. Metal buckles were stamped by the Mechanical Group from wrought iron—steel was too precious. However, Wei Aiwen traded cigarettes for private work—some brass buckles.

Lin Fu nervously stood outside the office. This Salt Village rugby star had enlisted. Though Xi Yazhou hadn't assigned village quotas—only requiring demonstration militiamen—the Village Committee decided these demonstrators should enlist, showing Salt Village's determination to follow the "Chiefs" in "revolution." This term came from Du Wen. What was revolution? Nobody knew. Salt Village had no literati; otherwise, they'd be terrified.

Lin Fu wasn't tall—about 165cm—but he was respectable for that era. Long-term rugby training gave him a robust build—he naturally became a model soldier. Now he was fully equipped in the future New Army configuration for the Military and Planning Committee review.

"Lin Fu, come in." Chief of Staff Ma's voice came from inside. Lin Fu didn't know what Chief of Staff meant—he simply understood he was the training ground's highest ranking officer. He pushed open the door and was startled.

It was a large room with a horseshoe arrangement of long tables. A dozen "Chiefs" all stared at him in the center—like the three-court examination scenes from operas.

Lin Fu performed the salute Wei Aiwen had taught him, loudly reporting:

"Report! Army Training Battalion, 1st Company, 1st Platoon, 1st Squad, Model Soldier Lin Fu reporting as ordered!"

Wei Aiwen stood and returned the salute: "At ease!"

"Yes sir!"

It was a proper exchange. This week's training hadn't been wasted. Everyone showed approving expressions. Before them stood a soldier holding a Year-One Minié rifle with a Year-One triangular bayonet attached, wearing a Year-One uniform, a cowhide German-style Y-strap, and carrying one large and one small ammunition pouch at his waist. He looked quite imposing.

"This is an imitation Taishō 11 ammunition pouch. The dimensions have been modified," Wei Aiwen explained. "It's made of cowhide and comes in two sizes: broad for paper cartridges, holding 60 rounds each, and small for percussion caps." Caps were sensitive—stored separately from cartridges. The pouches were designed for future compatibility with metal cartridges—using universal sizing.

"This is the canteen." Wei Aiwen pointed at the cylindrical object on Lin Fu's waist. "Made from bamboo with a cork stopper. A net rope sleeve attaches it to the belt. Doesn't it resemble German gas mask canisters?"

Indeed it did. Everyone nodded. Wei Aiwen seemed proud of this "German element."

The belt held a fabric grenade pouch containing the Chemistry Group's bamboo-shell grenades, which had weaker power but an impressive effect, making them useful for intimidation.

Lin Fu wore a peculiar backpack—more like a flat box than a pack. This was the newly developed regulation backbox. Inspired by the locals' common backbaskets, it was woven from fine rattan, lined with tung-oiled cloth, and equipped with a lid to make it waterproof. It had an elliptical shape with an ergonomic backframe.

This newly developed backbasket matched current industrial capabilities while far exceeding traditional bundles; it was a new product combining modern concepts with contemporary production.
