# Chapter 174: The 400-*Liao* Guangzhou-Style Ship

Wen Desi followed Shipwright Zhang to inspect-ships. He'd built many Western-ship models. Chinese-seagoing-ships—casual hobby. Frustratingly—domestic research lagged far-behind overseas—less professional. Even Chinese ancient-ship models were mostly foreign-collections. Available-resources were scarce.

Shipyard had no-drydock—just slipway-racks. Wen Desi knew drydock-history dated to Northern-Song Xining-era for imperial-barge-repairs. But subsequent-usage was rare—basically anomaly. Without Shen Kuo's records—probably unknown.

"How do you launch ships?" Wen Desi was curious about ancient-launching without slipways or docks.

"Cover beach with slippery-mud, then rope-haul."

Brilliantly-simple. Wen Desi nodded. "People's wisdom is inexhaustible"—not empty-phrase.

This ship was 70%-complete—hull formed but no-deck. With his limited ancient-ship knowledge, Wen recognized this as "Guangzhou-style ship" (*Guangchuan*). These were large Chinese-seagoing vessels: wide-top narrow-bottom, stern had "virtual-tail" (*xushao*). Key-feature: centerline-mounted drop-keel extending below-hull. This drop-board reduced rolling and leeway—Guangchuan's distinctive-trait. Dimensions roughly 400-*liao*—Ming government's maximum-allowed civilian-vessel. Though Chinese-shipwrights could obviously build thousand-ton ships—excessive-size was operationally-impractical.

Wen Desi estimated: 27m long, 5m+ wide, roughly 70-ton displacement. Similar to other 400-*liao* ships. Apparently standardized. Wen asked Shipwright Zhang whether he used "ship-books" (*chuanshu*). Zhang reddened embarrassedly: "No ship-book."

Wen Desi knew he guarded-secrets. Thinking: without impressing him—there'd be endless-evasions. Clearing throat—in Cantonese—recited string of numbers:

"400-*liao* warship-seat: length 8-*zhang* 6-*chi* 9-*cun*, beam 1-*zhang* 7-*chi*, labor 2,487..."

*(Note: measurements are Ministry-of-Works *chi* = 0.311m)*

Before finishing—Shipwright Zhang dropped-kneeling—face terrified: "My... my... lord..."

Wen Desi said: "Rise. Don't-fear!"

"My lord already-knows—"

"When you reach Bopu—see our iron-ships great-and-small—then you'll understand worldly-ingenuity's depths. What's one ship-book!" Wen Desi thought: just basic-info from ancient-ship enthusiasts' *Nanchuan Ji*.

"Yes, yes." Shipwright Zhang recognized this lord was expert. Hearing about unseen iron-ships excited him. Explanations became forthcoming.

This nearly-completed ship was double-masted, fir-hulled. This differed from Wen Desi's memory—books said Guangchuan featured "ironwood" (*tielimou*). Their captured-*Fubo* was also Guangchuan—though not ironwood, used same-hardwood lychee-wood.

Zhang explained: purely-cost. Ironwood was expensive—fir was abundant and cheap with adequate-strength. Per him: Cantonese merchant ordered this for regular-Nanyang-trade—buying new-ship each-voyage, sailing with cargo, selling ship-and-all at destination, returning on other-ships. Essentially one-use vessels—materials minimized, cheapness prioritized.

"How much for such-ship?"

"Standard-price 800-*liang*. With quality-timber—add 200."

So one-ship cost 1,000-*liang*. Navy was indeed money-furnace since antiquity. Shipbuilding needed private-capital involvement.

Structurally: 12 bulkheads divided hull into 13-compartments. Bulkhead-planks were large camphor-boards over-10cm-thick. This was Chinese-sailing-ships' world-leading feature: watertight-compartments. Bulkhead-to-hull junctions had cradling-ribs fixed with iron-nails. Near-bottom—two drain-holes per-bulkhead and cradling-rib. This surprised Wen Desi—drain-holes would compromise watertightness!

Zhang explained: drain-holes facilitated bilge-pumping—plugged with special-wooden-stoppers during sailing.

Hull-planks all-fir. Bottom-planks over-20cm, hull-sides 15cm. Strake-width 8–20cm—widest at-midships, narrowing bow/stern. Lateral-joints were butt-joints; longitudinal used flush-rabbet joints—seams filled with caulking. This mixture of hemp-fiber, tung-oil, and ground-oyster-shell. Tung-oil's tung-oleic-acid-glyceride easily polymerized—forming tough waterproof-film. Oyster-shell's 90%+-calcium-carbite and high-temp-burnt-lime best-combined with tung-oil. Lime's strong-bonding-plus-tung-oil produced calcium-tung-oleate—extremely waterproof. Plank-joints also iron-nailed—nail-holes sealed with oil-putty.

Third- and seventh-bulkhead positions had fore- and main-mast-steps. Mast-steps were large camphor-blocks fixed to bulkheads and hull—with two square-holes for mast-clasps securing-masts. Chinese-ships featured lowerable/removable-masts. Mast-steps had pivots—bulkheads had storage-holes for lowered-masts.

Ballast was beach-cobblestones—mainly in 3rd/4th-compartments. Both-sides had stringer-frames for lower-deck installation. Cargo and quarters were on this-deck.

Rudder was hardwood—even one-use-ships didn't-skimp on critical-parts. This was primitive-balanced adjustable-height-rudder. Rudder-blade had many-holes—Zhang said this reduced-steering-force-needed—another Guangchuan-exclusive-design.

Most-interesting to Wen Desi: workshop's stockpiled shipbuilding-materials. Especially iron-fittings. Chinese-ships used iron-nails since Warring-States—fully-mature by Tang/Song. Seeing these excited him. Nail-types alone: six-seven varieties—shovel-nails, square-nails, date-stone-nails, climbing-head-nails, flat-head-nails—various-purposes. Also peculiar L-shaped iron-fittings: 50cm long, 5cm wide, 0.6cm thick—one-end bent 90-degrees—four small-holes. Zhang explained: these were *ju*-clamps for connecting external-planks to bulkheads. Method: pre-cut slots in bulkheads and holes in-planks; hammer *ju*-clamp from outside through plank-hole into bulkhead-slot; nail *ju*-clamp to bulkhead.

Wen Desi wandered the-ship—contemplating transforming it into sail-cruiser. But too-small: 400-*liao* ships' cargo-capacity only 30–40 tons. As warship: maximum 6–8 guns. For industrial-scale material-transport—inadequate. As exploration-vessel—too-slow. Still need his-beloved double-masted schooner.

"Old Zhang," Wen Desi said, "what's your opinion of red-hair ships?"

"Tall ships. Have cannons. Don't fear storms or pirates."

"What else?"

"Sail-rigging is exquisite." Shipwright Zhang said honestly. "Fast. I've observed red-hair ships long-time—high-masts, much-sailcloth, greater-wind-capture. But true-secrets remain-impenetrable."

"Hmm. These I know."

Shipwright Zhang's eyes suddenly-gleamed. But knowing skills were livelihood—this-lord wouldn't easily-reveal—his eyes dimmed.

Wen Desi smiled: "Let me tell you. In Australia where we come—specialized schools teach shipbuilding. Everything you-and-I know about ships—combined—is just superficial. If interested—eventually someone will teach you."

Shipwright Zhang immediately-knelt, kowtowed repeatedly: "If my-lord transmits secret-arts—Zhang Jiqi is eternally-grateful—lifelong-service!"

"Hmm, rise." Wen Desi found large-rock, sat, opened notebook—revealing ship-line-drawing.

"Can you build this?"

Shipwright Zhang studied long-time. This drawing completely-differed from ship-books: precise-proportions, clear-accurate-lines, not simple-outlines. Unique three-view-drawing provided intuitive-perception. He secretly-marveled—just mastering this drafting-art guaranteed-lifetime-livelihood. These people were truly-extraordinary.

He asked proportion-questions—roughly-estimating 1,000-*liao*. This-scale—Zhang had never-built.

"I've never built this-size." Zhang said carefully. "I'm willing to try."

Wen Desi's chosen-design was double-masted schooner. Fast maneuverable—without armament, under-10-crew could operate. Besides cargo—30 formal-passengers. Excellent for exploration and maritime-patrol. Famous *America* was double-masted schooner—winning 1851 yacht-race. Total-crew including captain: 9. Later served as Confederate-blockade-runner during Civil-War. Displacement: 170 tons, 30m long, 7m beam, 3m draft. Armed with two 24-pounder carronades (broadside) plus one 12-pounder long-gun (center-pivot-mount). With lighter 6-pounders—could mount 6–8 guns.

*Note: Regarding Guangchuan, 400-*liao* data from Chinese Shipbuilding History. "*Liao*" interpretations vary—here using 1-*liao* = 60kg cargo-capacity.*
