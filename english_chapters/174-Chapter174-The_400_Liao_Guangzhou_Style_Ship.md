# Chapter 174: The 400-*Liao* Guangzhou-Style Ship

Wen Desi followed Shipwright Zhang to inspect the ships. He'd built many Western ship models. Chinese seagoing ships were a casual hobby. Frustratingly, domestic research lagged far behind overseas efforts and was less professional. Even models of ancient Chinese ships were mostly in foreign collections. Available resources were scarce.

The shipyard had no drydock—just slipway racks. Wen Desi knew that drydock history dated back to the Northern Song Xining era for imperial barge repairs. But subsequent usage was rare—basically an anomaly. Without Shen Kuo's records, it would probably be unknown.

"How do you launch ships?" Wen Desi was curious about ancient launching without slipways or docks.

"Cover the beach with slippery mud, then rope-haul."

Brilliantly simple. Wen Desi nodded. "The people's wisdom is inexhaustible"—not an empty phrase.

This ship was 70% complete—the hull was formed but there was no deck. With his limited ancient ship knowledge, Wen recognized this as a "Guangzhou-style ship" (*Guangchuan*). These were large Chinese seagoing vessels: wide-top, narrow-bottom, with a "virtual tail" (*xushao*) at the stern. A key feature was the centerline-mounted drop-keel extending below the hull. This drop-board reduced rolling and leeway—the Guangchuan's distinctive trait. The dimensions were roughly 400 *liao*—the Ming government's maximum allowed civilian vessel. Though Chinese shipwrights could obviously build thousand-ton ships, excessive size was operationally impractical.

Wen Desi estimated: 27m long, 5m+ wide, roughly 70-ton displacement. Similar to other 400-*liao* ships. Apparently, it was standardized. Wen asked Shipwright Zhang whether he used "ship books" (*chuanshu*). Zhang reddened embarrassedly: "No ship book."

Wen Desi knew he guarded secrets. Thinking that without impressing him there would be endless evasions, he cleared his throat and, in Cantonese, recited a string of numbers:

"400-*liao* warship seat: length 8 *zhang* 6 *chi* 9 *cun*, beam 1 *zhang* 7 *chi*, labor 2,487..."

*(Note: measurements are Ministry of Works chi = 0.311m)*

Before he finished, Shipwright Zhang dropped kneeling, his face terrified: "My... my... lord..."

Wen Desi said, "Rise. Don't fear!"

"My lord already knows—"

"When you reach Bopu and see our iron ships great and small, then you'll understand the depths of worldly ingenuity. What is one ship book!" Wen Desi thought: just basic info from ancient ship enthusiasts' *Nanchuan Ji*.

"Yes, yes." Shipwright Zhang recognized this lord was an expert. Hearing about unseen iron ships excited him. Explanations became forthcoming.

This nearly completed ship was double-masted and fir-hulled. This differed from Wen Desi's memory—books said Guangchuan featured "ironwood" (*tielimou*). Their captured *Fubo* was also a Guangchuan—though not ironwood, it used the same hardwood, lychee wood.

Zhang explained it was purely cost. Ironwood was expensive; fir was abundant and cheap with adequate strength. According to him: a Cantonese merchant ordered this for regular Nanyang trade—buying a new ship for each voyage, sailing with cargo, selling the ship and all at the destination, and returning on other ships. Essentially one-use vessels—materials were minimized, cheapness prioritized.

"How much is such a ship?"

"Standard price 800 *liang*. With quality timber, add 200."

So one ship cost 1,000 *liang*. The Navy has indeed been a money furnace since antiquity. Shipbuilding needed private capital involvement.

Structurally, 12 bulkheads divided the hull into 13 compartments. The bulkhead planks were large camphor boards over 10cm thick. This was Chinese sailing ships' world-leading feature: watertight compartments. Bulkhead-to-hull junctions had cradling ribs fixed with iron nails. Near the bottom, there were two drain holes per bulkhead and cradling rib. This surprised Wen Desi—drain holes would compromise watertightness!

Zhang explained that drain holes facilitated bilge pumping—they were plugged with special wooden stoppers during sailing.

The hull planks were all fir. Bottom planks were over 20cm thick, hull sides 15cm. Strake width was 8–20cm—widest at midships, narrowing at the bow and stern. Lateral joints were butt joints; longitudinal ones used flush-rabbet joints, with seams filled with caulking. This was a mixture of hemp fiber, tung oil, and ground oyster shell. Tung oil's tung-oleic-acid-glyceride easily polymerized, forming a tough waterproof film. Oyster shell's 90%+ calcium carbonate and high-temp-burnt lime best combined with tung oil. Lime's strong bonding plus tung oil produced calcium tung-oleate—extremely waterproof. Plank joints were also iron-nailed—nail holes sealed with oil putty.

The third and seventh bulkhead positions had fore and main mast steps. Mast steps were large camphor blocks fixed to the bulkheads and hull, with two square holes for mast clasps securing the masts. Chinese ships featured lowerable and removable masts. Mast steps had pivots, and bulkheads had storage holes for lowered masts.

Ballast consisted of beach cobblestones, mainly in the 3rd and 4th compartments. Both sides had stringer frames for lower deck installation. Cargo and quarters were on this deck.

The rudder was hardwood—even one-use ships didn't skimp on critical parts. This was a primitive balanced adjustable-height rudder. The rudder blade had many holes—Zhang said this reduced the steering force needed—another Guangchuan exclusive design.

Most interesting to Wen Desi were the workshop's stockpiled shipbuilding materials. Especially iron fittings. Chinese ships had used iron nails since the Warring States period, and the technology was fully mature by the Tang and Song dynasties. Seeing these excited him. There were six or seven varieties of nail types alone—shovel nails, square nails, date-stone nails, climbing-head nails, flat-head nails—various purposes. There were also peculiar L-shaped iron fittings: 50cm long, 5cm wide, 0.6cm thick—one end bent 90 degrees—four small holes. Zhang explained that these were *ju* clamps for connecting external planks to bulkheads. Method: pre-cut slots in bulkheads and holes in planks; hammer the *ju* clamp from outside through the plank hole into the bulkhead slot; then nail the *ju* clamp to the bulkhead.

Wen Desi wandered the ship, contemplating transforming it into a sail cruiser. But it was too small: the 400-*liao* ships' cargo capacity was only 30–40 tons. As a warship: maximum 6–8 guns. For industrial-scale material transport, it was inadequate. As an exploration vessel—too slow. He still needed his beloved double-masted schooner.

"Old Zhang," Wen Desi said, "what's your opinion of red-hair ships?"

"Tall ships. Have cannons. Don't fear storms or pirates."

"What else?"

"Sail rigging is exquisite," Shipwright Zhang said honestly. "Fast. I've observed red-hair ships a long time—high masts, much sailcloth, greater wind capture. But true secrets remain impenetrable."

"Hmm. These I know."

Shipwright Zhang's eyes suddenly gleamed. But knowing skills were his livelihood—this lord wouldn't easily reveal—his eyes dimmed.

Wen Desi smiled: "Let me tell you. In Australia, where we come from, specialized schools teach shipbuilding. Everything you and I know about ships—combined—is just superficial. If you're interested, eventually someone will teach you."

Shipwright Zhang immediately knelt, kowtowed repeatedly: "If my lord transmits secret arts—Zhang Jiqi is eternally grateful—lifelong service!"

"Hmm, rise." Wen Desi found a large rock, sat down, and opened his notebook, revealing a ship line drawing.

"Can you build this?"

Shipwright Zhang studied it for a long time. This drawing completely differed from ship books: it had precise proportions and clear, accurate lines, not simple outlines. The unique three-view drawing provided an intuitive perception. He secretly marveled—just mastering this drafting art would guarantee a lifetime livelihood. These people were truly extraordinary.

He asked proportion questions, roughly estimating 1,000 *liao*. This scale—Zhang had never built.

"I've never built this size," Zhang said carefully. "I'm willing to try."

Wen Desi's chosen design was a double-masted schooner. Fast and maneuverable—without armament, fewer than ten crew could operate it. Besides cargo, it could carry 30 formal passengers. Excellent for exploration and maritime patrol. The famous *America* was a double-masted schooner—winning the 1851 yacht race. Total crew including captain: 9. Later, it served as a Confederate blockade runner during the Civil War. Displacement: 170 tons, 30m long, 7m beam, 3m draft. Armed with two 24-pounder carronades (broadside) plus one 12-pounder long gun (center pivot mount). With lighter 6-pounders—could mount 6–8 guns.

*Note: Regarding Guangchuan, 400-liao data is from Chinese Shipbuilding History. "Liao" interpretations vary—here using 1-liao = 60kg cargo capacity.*
