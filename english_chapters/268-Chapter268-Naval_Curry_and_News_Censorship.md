# Chapter 268 Naval Curry and News Censorship

After many days of labor, the timber stockpiled in Yulin Fort had accumulated to several hundred cubic meters. The logs were piled up in the courtyard of Yulin Fort. Bai Guoshi knew that for long-term storage, the water immersion method was best—timber submerged in fresh water was sealed off from air and could remain unrotted for a long time. But this required a sufficient body of water, and there were no such conditions near Yulin Fort.

If they used the dry storage method, it was simple and easy to implement. Yulin's rainy season hadn't arrived yet, and the timber dried out quite quickly. However, if the timber was later to be transported away by ship-towed rafts, thoroughly dried wood would quickly absorb water at sea and sink, causing great trouble for towing.

Therefore, he could only adopt the wet storage method, which was the most convenient but had some impact on wood quality. The felled timber was stacked into piles, each about twenty-five cubic meters. They were covered with branches and leaves, and someone was assigned to regularly sprinkle water on them daily to maintain a certain level of humidity.

But this storage method could last three months at most; otherwise, the wood quality would deteriorate. According to Wang Luobin, they would send another ship in thirty days at most. Storing the timber for one month should be fine.

Plenty of leftover branches and scraps remained from logging. Bai Guoshi arranged for all these twigs to be collected and dried on the beach for use as firewood at Yulin Fort. He also selected some thicker branches for making charcoal. Charcoal burned more steadily and produced more heat than firewood, making it more convenient to use.

Next, the entire Yulin Fort garrison threw themselves into coconut harvesting. The coconuts near the shore had mostly been picked clean by the fleet. Now they ventured further inland to harvest, bringing back several hundred coconuts a day. In the evenings, everyone split open coconuts and drank the coconut water; the excess was poured into clay pots and stored in the cold-storage well. The coconut meat was dried into copra.

Wang Tao saw the coconut meat drying on the beach, spread out on palm leaves. Drinking coconut water, he strolled around and suddenly thought of curry—in India, coconut meat was often used as an ingredient in curry. So he used coconut meat, the mutton gifted by Old Man Hu, pumpkin, and the seasonings left behind by the fleet to make a mutton curry. The hot, fragrant, and spicy curry sauce was poured over freshly cooked rice. Though it was the marines' first time experiencing the heat of chili peppers, they found it novel, and everyone ate with great enthusiasm. That day happened to be a Friday, and so Wang Tao became the inventor of curry rice and established what would become the naval tradition of eating curry rice every Friday.

The activities at Yulin Fort attracted Hu Xun's attention. Using the delivery of finished clothes as an excuse, he personally crossed the bay to visit these newly settled residents. Wang Tao made curry rice again, leaving Old Master Hu's mouth burning red. Combined with a cup of chilled, refreshing coconut water, Old Master Hu repeatedly exclaimed how enjoyable it was. He immediately asked for the curry rice recipe and inquired about the uniquely spicy flavor. Where did it come from? Wang Tao knew that chili peppers should have been introduced to China around the Wanli era, but this region clearly didn't know about this crop yet. He told him it was *fanjiao* (番椒, "foreign pepper"), introduced from overseas. Hu Xun expressed interest in obtaining some seeds to plant, but Yulin Fort only had chili powder and chili paste, no seeds. They could only give him a bag of chili powder.

Hu Xun asked if they were felling timber and harvesting coconuts in such large quantities for overseas trade. He was quite familiar with overseas trade matters and said he'd never seen any foreign ships carrying dried coconut. Wang Tao quickly asked: Were there any merchants from Qiongshan County who came to buy dried coconut?

"I've heard that merchants from the prefectural capital occasionally came to Yazhou to buy dried coconut, but not often. Wenchang is only two days' sailing from Qiongshan, and they have a hundred times more coconuts there than here, and the route is much shorter. Why would they come all the way here to buy copra? Besides, this place is still several days' journey from Yazhou City—too far to be practical."

Wang Tao thought that the Qiongshan copra merchants weren't as tightly controlling the market as he'd imagined. That Lin Quan'an fellow was either making excuses out of laziness or simply never came to such desolate places. But then again, he was a merchant—he naturally gravitated towards cities for trade. His approach was different from that of a pioneering team like theirs.

"To be honest," Wang Tao said, "I run an oil-pressing workshop in Lingao, specifically using copra to press oil. We sell it overseas to Australia and can make a lot of money. Unfortunately, Lingao doesn't produce coconuts, so we've been searching everywhere."

These words were intended for Hu Xun's ears, to make him see this as an opportunity for partnership. Unexpectedly, Old Master Hu didn't care about this at all. He just laughed it off, saying that in a few days, some officials from the county would be coming down to the countryside. That would be a good opportunity to help them register their estate. Of course, some entertaining and gift-giving would be unavoidable. Wang Tao understood his meaning and gave Old Master Hu some more white sugar along with two bottles of *Guoshi Wushuang* liquor, saying he would offer further thanks after the matter was settled.

After seeing Hu Xun off, Wang Tao felt slightly disappointed. He had originally expected Old Master Hu to proactively request participation in the coconut-harvesting and timber-felling enterprise. Yulin Fort, after all, had few hands. With a local power like Hu Xun joining in, they would not only gain an extra layer of protection locally but also have much more manpower available. But there was no reaction at all.

He hadn't realized that gentry from a backwater like this had extremely limited vision. They had long grown accustomed to sitting back and extracting tribute from passersby like tax collectors, waiting for offerings to come to them. Why would they bother with such labor-intensive real industry? As long as Yulin Fort gave them some benefits, whether it was logging or coconut harvesting didn't concern them—it was outside their scope of consideration whether there might be greater profits to be had.

Bai Guoshi said, "Such a pity about the population in Anyoule Market and his estate. Otherwise, we could strip every coconut from this area."

Old Di said, "That guy is just being a dog in the manger. We should just wipe him out later. Merge all the people into Yulin Fort."

"Wait a few more months. Once our main wave of immigrants arrives, Old Master Hu will definitely get restless. By then, we'll have to show our hand. Either he submits to our leadership, or he prepares to sever ties with the people." Wang Tao sighed. "Such a good opportunity to join the revolution and he's not taking it—he could have at least been a 'democratic personage,' with his descendants guaranteed a seat in the local political consultative conference. Now he might well end up labeled a landlord, rich peasant, counter-revolutionary, rightist, or bad element."

Sighing was one thing, but the resource collection work continued. In their spare time, out of boredom, Yulin Fort frequently exchanged messages via radio with Lingao Main Station and Changhua Fort, sharing their living conditions and personal feelings. One day, Dingding saw one of their incoming messages at Lingao Telecom's receiving station and was struck with inspiration. Using the material from the telegram, she wielded her literary pen, embellished it, and wrote a prose piece called *Nights at Yulin Harbor*, published under the pseudonym "Sentinel of the Southern Sky" in the *Lingao Times*. It was unexpectedly very popular among the transmigrators. So she appointed Wang Tao as a special correspondent, requiring him to write a dispatch every few days for her to polish and serialize. Wang Tao didn't disappoint; upon receiving the telegram requesting his contributions, he immediately sent another piece. Dingding worked through the night editing and polishing it. After typesetting, she submitted the draft first thing in the morning to Zhou Dongtian for stenciling, ready for printing.

Unexpectedly, before the paper went to press, Dingding received a call from Zhou Dongtian.

"The paper can't be printed," Zhou Dongtian said helplessly. "Notification from the relevant higher authorities: The *Yulin Harbor Journals* essay series has secrecy issues and must be edited before the *Times* can go to print. Also, the previous issue carrying the series is currently being recalled. And furthermore, from now on, all articles in the *Times* containing such information must be submitted for review before printing—"

"Whose idiotic regulation is this!" Dingding almost jumped. Since D-Day, she and her husband Panpan had been running a two-person mom-and-pop shop with no budget, no benefits—basically operating off the books. She'd finally made it to a formal position at the *Times*, and now suddenly there was another familiar "notification from the relevant higher authorities"!

"What the hell! I haven't even written about the Executive Committee's corruption yet, and they're already giving me the bureaucratic runaround!" Dingding immediately stormed off to the Executive Committee compound.

Entering the compound, she hesitated again. Anyone who'd ever had to deal with government offices knew that this vague "relevant higher authority" was the hardest thing to find. When they issued a notification, they existed. But when you tried to find them, nobody admitted to being that "relevant authority."

After thinking for a moment, she decided to go to the printing room to find Zhou Dongtian and get some inside information. Although he did printing work, he had always had a side role with Internal Affairs. Since the reason given was a supposed "secrecy" issue, the "relevant authority" was most likely from Internal Affairs or Intelligence.

Zhou Dongtian did know something. He said the matter was communicated via a phone call from Ran Yao. Dingding of course knew Ran Yao—he'd been with the Security Group before and was transferred to the Internal Affairs Committee after the organizational restructuring.

So she marched out of the compound in one breath and came to the Internal Affairs Committee compound, a place few people ever visited. But she was stopped by the two sentries at the gate. Because she hadn't registered for a visit in advance and didn't have a pass to enter the compound, the sentries resolutely refused to let her in. After throwing a fit and pulling rank as an official, she still failed—"No registration, no pass, no entry. Those are the orders." The sentries could barely speak Mandarin, but this one sentence they had down pat.

Dingding was chased away from the gate like a defeated rooster. She was just about to go back to the newspaper office to dig up Ran Yao's cellphone number from the directory and come back to argue, when she saw a portly fellow waddling out of the compound, belly first, looking perfectly unhurried. Seeing the scene unfold, he slowly ambled over and asked, "Comrade, is there something I can help you with?"

"You're still calling me 'Comrade'! It's only been a few days since D-Day!" Dingding fumed, her response completely missing the point. "I want to see Ran Yao! Ran Yao, get out here! You're oppressing freedom of speech!" This kind of outburst would have drawn a crowd in the heart of Bairencheng, but the Internal Affairs Committee was in a remote corner—she could shout herself hoarse and no one would notice.

"Don't shout. Ran Yao went to Bopu to chair a meeting. You're Dingding, right? Let's have a chat." The portly fellow remained amiable.

"Who are you?"

"Oh, I'm just a clerk at the committee. A nobody." The fatty was all smiles.

This was Dingding's first time inside the Internal Affairs Committee compound. As soon as she walked through the gate, past the gray brick walls covered with thorny vines, she felt a chill run from her feet straight up her spine, and she shivered involuntarily. In the center of the compound stood a two-story gray brick building with two wings. The courtyard had been planted with many trees, casting the compound in deep shade.

The fatty led Dingding into a simple prefab room not far from the entrance. Inside were some furniture and stationery—probably a reception area for visitors. Someone brought over a cup of bag tea. Dingding sneered:

"Is this 'inviting me for tea'?"

"Plain boiled water is fine too." The fatty had a soft expression. "We don't have coffee here."

Dingding launched into a rapid-fire account of the publication restrictions. She demanded to know what meaning such so-called "secrecy" had. Why couldn't the broad mass of transmigrators know the current state of affairs of the Transmigration Collective? Did they have any awareness of respecting the transmigrators' right to know?

"Well, that much is of course respected. The Internal Affairs Committee is just an ordinary institution, after all." The fatty wore a lukewarm smile and didn't directly answer her questions. "How many copies is the *Lingao Times* printing each day these days?"

"Three hundred copies." Dingding replied sullenly. She had originally wanted to print over a thousand, but there were shortages of ink, paper, and printing equipment.

"According to the figures the *Times* office reported to the Planning Committee, a little more than half of these papers go to transmigrators, including copies for departments, enterprises, and dormitory reading rooms. The remainder goes either to the county yamen or is sold retail at Dongmen Market, right?"

"Right. If I were allocated more resources, circulation could be even higher—"

"The more copies the *Times* distributes, the louder our voice becomes, and the greater our influence over the indigenous masses. This is the Executive Committee's established policy." The fatty spoke slowly and methodically. "But consider this: once a paper reaches the hands of the indigenes, a lot of information is inadvertently leaked—"

"Just for this? So from now on, do Wen Zong's and Ma Dugong's and other transmigrators' appearances in the paper need to use pseudonyms and their faces need to be pixelated? Why don't we just publish nothing at all, just write 'All is peaceful today,' or simply fill the paper with Du Wen's long-winded essays!"

"No need to get worked up." The fatty remained as gentle as a spring breeze. "The *Yulin Harbor* series is very well-written. It's received high praise from everyone. The reason the Internal Affairs Committee objects to publishing it as-is is out of concern for the safety of our comrades at the overseas stations—the reports contain time, place, people, equipment—everything. If the paper leaks out and happens to fall into the hands of Liu Xiang or some other party hostile to us—a little fort with just a dozen people could be wiped out in an instant."

Dingding was startled. Thinking about it, this was indeed an oversight on her part. But unwilling to concede, she said stubbornly, "Yulin is not even called Yulin right now! Do you think Ming Dynasty people are capable of deducing where this is?"

"Dadonghai is still called Dadonghai, isn't it?" the fatty said. "And Anyoule Market—these are all contemporary names from this spacetime. How would Ming Dynasty people not know them? The article even wrote that Anyoule Market is right across from Yulin Fort. How much clearer could it be?"

Dingding had nothing to say. She clearly felt she was in the right, but this huge hat came down on her head and she had no comeback. The interests of transmigrators came first—she couldn't very well argue that the right to information trumped these people's personal safety, could she?
