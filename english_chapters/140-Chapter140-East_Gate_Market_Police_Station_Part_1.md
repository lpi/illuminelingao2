# Chapter 140: East Gate Market Police Station (Part 1)

Clear skies, cloudless. Lingao's winter was approaching. The previously-sweltering weather had cooled considerably. Autumn-harvest nearing completion—busy commoners now had leisure.

Bairren population had increased. The usually-empty simple-road attracted many pedestrians due to its convenience.

East Gate Market's commercial activity greatly enhanced transmigrator-local connections. Besides salt, the rice-mill produced clean, attractive rice—honest operations showing exactly how much rice, bran, and husks. No skimming or cheating—far superior to village-workshops. Best of all: flexible payment—silver obviously accepted, but unhulled-rice, milled-rice, bran, even straw could offset processing-fees. This attracted nearby grain-households. Outsourced-processing accounted for 60% of mill-operations—daily processing-fees alone brought 10+ *shi* rice plus considerable husks. With convenient processing, good roads, no taxes—East Gate Market was becoming Lingao County's grain-processing-and-wholesale center. During routine inspections, Dongmen Chuiyu discovered grain-households from neighboring-counties coming here to trade. Truly—profit made people risk life and limb.

East Gate Street's roadside-plots had been partially sold. Several shops were under construction—mostly opened by county-gentry. Besides commercial-opportunities, this gave connections with short-hairs—if problems arose, shopkeepers could directly negotiate. Bricks, tiles, and timber were ready-made—continuously transported from Damei Village's Gou Manor demolition-site. Beyond transmigrators' own-use, most were cheaply sold to lot-buyers.

Lin Quan'an—first peddler to trade with short-hairs—had become the area's biggest food-supplier. After Gou Manor reconnaissance—he'd earned twenty *liang* reward. With mass-migration to Bairren Fortress—his food-supply scale doubled. He'd built a shop at East Gate Market, hired an accountant, employed four-to-five workers, daily carting through villages collecting live-pigs, poultry, eggs, vegetables. Lin Quan'an was already planning: soon he'd return to Fujian for his wife, or build a house in his hometown and take a concubine for Lingao... Such glorious prospects made him float.

One annoyance: workers' food was too good—his heartache wasn't for short-hairs' money (theoretically, well-fed workers made him more money)—but this set bad examples. Several workers had already quit to join short-hairs. Though Lin Quan'an earned well, capitalist-nature still made him resist improving employee-conditions—someone would always work.

But recently situations changed. Autumn-harvest was nearly finished. Lingao didn't grow wheat—post-rice-harvest peasants usually took short-term-work. Previously, off-season day-laborers required no wages—just meals. But now short-hairs were mass-recruiting at East Gate Market. Off-season laborers all went to them. Mainland migrants coming to Lingao mostly became short-hair long-term workers. Result: labor-market unprecedentedly tight. Under short-hairs' benchmark-effect, entire labor-market prices rose.

Wage-increases made markets livelier. Even neighboring-county peddlers were attracted. Besides merchants—locals who weren't starving brought families to Bairren to gawk: they couldn't enter the fortress, but walking around trenches and barbed-wire—glimpsing from distance was fine. Button-front short-clothes, strange rattan-helmets, long bayonet-mounted muskets, buildings on the beach with giant pipes below... More adventurous visitors followed simple-roads to Bopu Harbor—seeing legendary steel-ships.

Commoners' fear of short-hairs diminished. Dongmen Chuiyu found Chinese commoners' commercial-instincts were truly strong. Not just merchants at East Gate Market—roadside tea-vendors appeared. All three blockhouses along the route had tea-stalls. Military-Group soldiers now frequently faced merchant-harassment—besides vegetable and poultry-sellers, they had to chase away flirtatious women. Not that their revolutionary-will was strong—they simply couldn't enjoy such fortune.

Subsequently, security-issues emerged. Busy places attracted all sorts. Besides overt/covert prostitutes—gambling-stalls appeared, then pickpockets and thieves, then beggars. Various underworld-trades gradually surfaced.

Most serious problem: theft. Daily, several unlucky victims lost money or goods. Even Li Mei's Welfare-Society shop was burglarized. Dugu Qiuhun's "East Gate Market Comprehensive Law-Enforcement Squad"—though daily catching thieves—weren't professionals. Ming-commoners all looked similar to them; language barriers compounded problems—basically futile. Occasionally catching someone—prisoners would kneel, gabble in incomprehensible dialect, sometimes wailing and rolling on the ground—eventually released. Then came brawl-incidents from gambling-disputes.

Soon, the first bloodshed alarmed transmigrators: the market witnessed scenes transmigrators knew well—street-fights.

17th-century gang-fights weren't different from 21st-century ones—just more dangerous-looking. No watermelon-knives, but fire-hardened bamboo-spears, sharpened wooden-clubs, naturally bricks. Instantly, the bustling market became chaos—people fleeing, chickens squawking, dogs running—wails rising. Soon, a bamboo-shed cluster near East Gate Street caught fire. By the time Dugu Qiuhun's enforcement-squad donned full equipment and Military-Group reinforcements arrived—crowds had scattered. Seven corpses remained—plus devastation: 10+ stalls burned.

Dugu Qiuhun's mouth twisted with fury. Other arriving Committee-members were also shocked. Since opening, East Gate Market had been all positive-news: increasing peddlers, growing customers, people buying lots... In short, this was the best example of transmigrator-native harmony.

Now this example looked like this—damage wasn't severe, but market-brawls with fatalities definitely damaged market-reputation and theirs. Most embarrassing: after half-a-day's investigation, Dugu Qiuhun couldn't identify perpetrators—couldn't even determine cause-and-effect. Helplessly, he approached Committee—requesting police training.

"This enforcement-squad isn't working!" Dugu Qiuhun finally recognized the key-problem. "We can't communicate with locals—can't understand ground-level situations."

"Can Security-Group assign people for patrol?" Xiao Zishan wasn't enthusiastic about training local-police—he felt locals couldn't yet be trusted.

"Security-Group can't spare anyone for us." Dugu Qiuhun knew well—he'd visited several times. Seven-to-eight people were overwhelmed with prisoner-interrogation, personnel-vetting, file-organizing. No time for patrol-assistance—plus, they'd face identical language-barriers.

"We really can't spare anyone. Security-Group is basically internal-security now." Ran Yao said helplessly. "Training police—I think it's entirely feasible. With larger controlled-populations—we need law-enforcement institutions for social-order."

Travelers' first police-institution—"East Gate Market Police Station"—was thus established. Dugu Qiuhun served as station-chief. Mu Min became station-instructor—meaning: instructing station-operations. She'd done security-work; East Gate's main-problem was security.

Station reported to Security-Group for oversight; funding came from site-management—i.e., East Gate Industrial-Commercial Bureau.

"But I have no money!" Dugu Qiuhun pleaded to civil-affairs-responsible Xiao Zishan. "Station even uses our Industrial-Commercial Bureau offices. East Gate Market doesn't collect taxes—can't fund expenses!"

"Then collect some security-fees. Current police-stations also charge businesses."

"How can that work? That's arbitrary-fee-collection! Besides, we're in the key phase of attracting investment—"

"Heh, stop crying poor." Xiao Zishan snorted. "What about your Industrial-Commercial Bureau's land-sales income? You didn't give those shop-lots away for free."

Dugu Qiuhun was momentarily speechless. Industrial-Commercial Bureau's slush-fund indeed had 100+ *liang* from lot-rentals. Committee hadn't issued land-policy, so transactions used "land-lease" terminology—prices were low. These funds should theoretically be remitted—but unclear-policies meant Financial-Department couldn't book it. Money stayed at East Gate Industrial-Commercial Bureau.

"But that's embezzling public-funds. Besides, without land-policy, spending money can't be properly reimbursed."

Cheng Dong thought momentarily: "How about this—your Industrial-Commercial Bureau first fills out a deposit-slip. Clearly state income-source. I'll book it as non-routine-income. Then I'll fully-return it as East Gate's operating-expenses. You won't need to carry silver back-and-forth."

"Okay, that works. Let's do that." Dugu Qiuhun left happily with problem resolved.

"You really have solutions." Xiao Zishan said.

Cheng Dong shook his head repeatedly: "Our fiscal-system also needs reform."
