# Chapter 699 - The Pirates

Le Lin said: "I heard that Tai O was also an important den for pirates and smugglers in the Pearl River Estuary in the past."

"Tung Chung and Tai O on Lantau Island are both important targets we need to pay attention to—it's best if we can clear them out completely." Chen Haiyang said, "Let's first see the attitude of the pirates gathering at Lantau."

As they were talking, a sentry came to report: a sampan was approaching the temporary pier from the direction of Lantau Island.

"Sounds like a local envoy." Chen Haiyang said. "Let's hear what they have to say first."

Chen Haiyang didn't plan to receive them in the command tent—he understood the mindset of the natives in this timeline very well, especially those contacting transmigrators for the first time. If you didn't put on airs, people would think much less of your ability and credibility. approachability was good, but necessary airs couldn't be dispensed with.

So the headquarters specially built a "Great Tent" in a sheltered hollow not far from the pier. It was surrounded by curtains, with nets draped outside adorned with many bells—a concept borrowed from Japanese military curtains and Mongol net fortifications. Not only were materials exquisite, but it was decorated with many patterns.

Around the curtains stood various flags and banners newly invented by the Australian regime, looking very majestic. Combined with fully armed Marines and cadets standing guard, the entire net fortress appeared solemn and awe-inspiring.

Five or six envoys arrived by boat. The three leaders were relatively well-dressed, looking like prosperous local residents. They all followed the Marines respectfully toward the Great Tent.

Quite a few gifts were unloaded from the boat—the transmigrators had seen this many times. Nothing more than pigs, sheep, shochu, plus silk and silver.

Upon entering the Great Tent and seeing Chen Haiyang sitting in the center, they immediately knelt and kowtowed, presenting the gift list.

The visitors were indeed pirates—a small band, to be precise. The leader of the group was the second-in-command of this band, named Jin Caifa.

Jin Caifa's main purpose was to request "submission" and join the "Australian Big Gang" in looting together. Jin Caifa's "Boss" was named Zheng Bao. He had 28 large two-masted ships and about 70 "long dragon" boats and sampans capable of maneuvering on inland rivers. Among the smaller bands, his strength was quite significant.

Zheng Bao planned to take advantage of the government army's crushing defeat, low morale, and the emptiness of land and sea defenses to enter the Pearl River for large-scale looting. For this, he not only anchored around Lantau waiting for opportunities but also gathered many scattered small bands. Including the group led by Zhao Yajin that had launched a surprise attack on the Task Force a few days ago. He currently had quite a few fishermen-turned-temporary-pirates under him, ranging from one boat to three or four.

The sudden arrival of the Australian fleet made Zheng Bao feel an opportunity had arrived—if he could attach himself to this big gang, it would greatly benefit his future career in maritime looting. When Chen Yajin started his reckless looting action, he didn't stop it—he wanted to see with his own eyes how the Australian warships actually fought.

"So, you intend to enter the Pearl River?"

"Yes, we wish to follow the Australian bosses, fight together and get rich!" Jin Caifa said.

"Hmph." Chen Haiyang remained noncommittal. If he accepted their submission, they would be a useful force in the next phase of Pearl River operations. But such pirates couldn't be effectively controlled; their obedience to orders depended entirely on sufficient profit. Moreover, the pirates' excessive cruelty in action would cause the Australians to lose popular support. Additionally, the pirates were strong; operating in formation with them would give them opportunities to turn on the fleet—all these had to be considered beforehand.

He thought for a moment and replied:

"Do you know that we are the formal regular army of the Australian-Song Court? How can we get rich with you?" Chen Haiyang showed a look of contempt. "If you are willing to submit to the Australian-Song Court, you become Australian-Song subjects. You become Australian-Song soldiers. Not pirate bands looting on the sea like you are now. Are you willing?"

Jin Caifa shifted uneasily on the ground. He didn't know what these words meant—was it an agreement or refusal? In his concept, everyone robbed together; the leaders took the big share, the followers took small shares. It was that simple. Why drag in talk about "regular army"? Did they want them to become Australian soldiers?

"Please clarify, my lords."

Chen Haiyang said: "Go back and tell your leader: if he sincerely wants to submit to our Australian-Song, tell him to first inventory all personnel, silver, money, gunpowder, and weapons into a register, then personally bring the register here."

Jin Caifa hesitated, then observing the expression, knew there was no room for negotiation. He said he would go back to "report to the chief for decision," and took his leave.

Wen Desi said: "It's clear they won't surrender. Next is our good chance to make a name for ourselves at the Pearl River Estuary."

"If we had enough political workers, I wouldn't object to a nominal absorption first, then sending political workers in to reform the pirates. There's no time for that now; we'll have to let the purification camp do more work."

Le Lin volunteered to reconnoiter the pirate situation on Lantau.

Chen Haiyang said: "Forget it. Don't think spending a few holidays on outlying islands makes you familiar with the terrain. Let the Special Reconnaissance Team handle it."

As Jin Caifa walked toward his sampan at the pier, he suddenly saw a familiar-looking bald bandit nearby. Looking closely, it was Shi Shisi, a former subordinate of Zhucailao. He saw him wearing the bald bandits' buttoned jacket, belted at the waist, carrying a short sword and the famous "Australian hand cannon."

Shi Shisi stood on the bow of a large ship, looking full of ambition. If one didn't know his background, no one would guess he was actually a "fake bald bandit."

Jin Caifa had worked under Zhucailao in the past. Although Shi Shisi wasn't a major leader, he wasn't an unknown small fry in the big gang. Jin Caifa naturally recognized him.

Returning to the anchorage at Tung Chung, Jin Caifa reported the details of meeting Chen Haiyang to Zheng Bao.

"That big leader looked very arrogant, wanting us to become soldiers of some Australian-Song Navy..." Jin Caifa spat. "I'd rather live my carefree life than be controlled by him, becoming a soldier for an Australian-Song whose shadow I've never even seen..."

"They didn't mention giving our brothers any official positions or military pay after switching sides?"

"No! Nothing at all. Just wanted us to hand over registers and prepare for reorganization."

"Damn it, these Australian wretches! What do they take me for!" Zheng Bao cursed along. "I'm at least the Marquis of Guiyi and General of Ninghai of the Great Le Dynasty!"

"This lowly one is still a Vice General!" Jin Caifa remembered his own title—and a big wooden seal. Although he couldn't read the characters on it, he had stamped it on paper again and again.

Zheng Bao's pirate band had gone to Jiangping, where they accepted the pacification of the Northern Dynasty of Vietnam (Le Dynasty), becoming nominal Le Dynasty naval forces. The Le Dynasty's puppet emperor had bestowed various official titles and peerages upon them. Of course, wooden seals and many documents were included.

Chinese pirates like Zheng Bao accepting the so-called pacification of the Later Le Dynasty wasn't purely for empty titles, but to obtain certain protection and a place to fence stolen goods. And the Northern Dynasty was also very interested in gaining revenue from pirate activities.

But empty titles held great attraction for pirates. Originally, they were the lowest status people along the Chinese coast, subject to exploitation and bullying by officials and gentry. Now, they suddenly became "officials" of a small court, possessing peerages they wouldn't dare dream of in China—even if just empty paper—gaining prestige and status abroad through maritime robbery. This attraction was no less than getting rich.

Zheng Bao had hoped to receive even more generous titles from the Australians. Unexpectedly, the Australians were very cold to them, setting conditions that practically amounted to surrender. Hearing Jin Caifa's rambling complaints, Zheng Bao's temper rose.

Zheng Bao called the trusted aides who had accompanied Jin Caifa to inquire about specific details after landing on Hong Kong Island. Then he ordered: "Invite Advisor Wang."

The so-called Advisor Wang was Wang You, former general manager of Zhucailao's main camp. Amidst the chaos of the crushing defeat at Nanri Island, he had barely managed to break out in a small boat, escaping with his life. He fled to Zheng Bao.

Zheng Bao used to be a local tyrant along the coast, half-civilian half-bandit. After Zhucailao's defeat, over a dozen of Zhucailao's large ships came to join him. He also gathered and sheltered many remnants of Zhucailao's subordinates, expanding his influence greatly. Zheng Bao then simply raised his own flag and started the pirate business.

Pirates like him were different from Liu Xiang, Zhucailao, and Zheng Zhilong. Those great pirates were also maritime merchants; their fierce battles at sea were mainly to seize monopoly rights over overseas trade. But Zheng Bao's sole purpose was looting to get rich; he was a true "sea bandit."

Zheng Bao had intended to use Wang You's prestige as former camp manager to recruit Zhucailao's old subordinates. But efforts to re-recruit the remnants yielded little result. Zheng Bao faced competition from two great powers: on one side Zheng Zhilong's big gang, on the other the Lingao group.

Zheng Zhilong's power was at its zenith, and the Lingao Australians had a consolidated base area; both were more attractive than Zheng Bao. Most of the treasure in Zhucailao's main camp had been snatched by Zhu Ting—whereabouts unknown. Zheng Bao only had the empty title of a former camp manager. As a newly emerged group leader, Zheng Bao naturally didn't have much wealth to use. Without money, ships, and men, sworn brothers could turn hostile at any moment. Wang You's name couldn't attract anyone either.

Although he collected quite a few scattered personnel and small boats, he ultimately didn't recruit many large ships.

*The Vietnamese court granting official titles to Chinese pirates to involve them in civil war actually happened in the Qing dynasty. There are no such records in the Ming dynasty.*

*However, given the intensity of the Northern and Southern dynasties' fighting and both sides hiring Europeans as external aid, it would be strange if the Vietnamese didn't attempt to recruit pirates highly active in the South China Sea.*
