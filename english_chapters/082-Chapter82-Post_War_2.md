# Chapter 82 - Post-War (2)

"They wouldn't want our lives, right?"

"Sigh, my mother must be worried sick." Ma Peng started to wipe tears.

Fu Buer felt bitter. You have an old mother, but I have a whole family up and down! The wife is one thing, but he couldn't bear to part with the few concubines he took, especially the third concubine taken from Guangzhou. Although she was a bit old, she was from a brothel background after all (Note: Advanced brothel, called 'Xingyuan' at that time. Being a bit old here is according to the standards of Ming Dynasty people; a woman of twenty-seven or twenty-eight is considered a middle-aged woman). She dressed coquettishly and could sing little tunes, much better than local country girls, making Master Fu fascinated.

Thinking that his son was young and his daughter couldn't support the household, if he couldn't go back, wouldn't the accumulated family property be embezzled by those uncles and brothers of the same clan? It wasn't just a day or two that his clan members were jealous of him. The more he thought, the more he regretted. Seeing that the surveillance around was not tight, with only two teenage pirates watching, he groped around on his body and found some scattered broken silver, totaling two taels. Fearing it wasn't enough, he took off his gold-plated silver net scarf ring—this was estimated to be worth two or three mace. He thought for a long time. Thinking that more than two taels of silver to buy a person's escape, this price should be enough; these little lackeys shouldn't have too big an appetite.

Fu Buer summoned up courage, trembling as he edged closer to the teenage pirate holding a bird gun, offering the silver. He could speak some Guangzhou dialect, but obviously the teenager didn't understand. He had to point to himself, then to the outside, making a running gesture.

The teenager, however, showed no kindness, gesturing at him with the bird gun equipped with a sword, scaring Fu Buer into silence. But he didn't dare to withdraw the hand holding the silver—forget it, anyway, it won't be his after the body search later; getting some care would be good. However, the teenager didn't take his money, only signaling him to take it back, then pointed to his injured leg, and pointed to the big tent on the side. Fu Buer knew it meant he should wait here for treatment.

Busy until the evening, the medical team finally finished treating all the wounded. Fu Buer had more than ten stitches on his leg—for the doctor, this person was lucky; the bullet penetrated the muscle without staying in his body or breaking bones or blood vessels. But for Fu Buer, it was a completely novel experience. He learned for the first time that flesh could be stitched up like a tailor stitches clothes, although he screamed like dying during the stitching.

Two-thirds of the more than thirty heavily wounded died while waiting. As for the remaining ones, the doctors felt there was little hope of saving them after checking: no plasma, lack of qualified nurses; these people would hardly survive even if they got on the operating table.

"Let the Military Team give them a quick end." He Ma knew that with materials being extremely precious now, it was unlikely to use limited medical resources to treat these people.

Shi Niaoren pondered for a moment and said: "Forget it, treat a dead horse as a living horse. They could last from noon until now, their vitality is strong enough. Let's try."

"But there is no plasma, have to find people to donate blood. Have to test blood type..."

"Just use normal saline," Shi Niaoren made up his mind, "No need for anesthetics either. Whether they survive depends on their luck."

"This... this..." The people in the medical team were stunned. Performing surgery on these people who were heavily wounded, lost blood, and some were already in a coma, without anesthetics and plasma, isn't that equivalent to killing?

"Didn't I say, treat a dead horse as a living horse? Whether they live depends on their fortune." Shi Niaoren had another sentence he didn't say: Instead of watching them die helplessly, dying on the operating table would make his heart slightly more peaceful. He had another sentence he couldn't say even more, conveniently let everyone practice surgery.

"Come on, let's get to work." With his greeting, the medical team busy for most of the day started busy again. However, medical staff were really not enough, especially nurses, so doctors had to help doctors. Finally, even the veterinarian Doctor Yang was called over. He just finished treating the injuries of the three captured horses and treated their horse diseases by the way.

"Old Yang, can you operate on people?"

"I can operate on horses..." Yang Baogui joked, "Give me the work of debridement, disinfection, and suturing wounds; these are all similar. By the way, if amputation is needed, I can also do it."

"Let's start."

The post-war review meeting held in the evening sorted out five main problems based on the actual situation exposed in the battle.

1. Insufficient military training, poor fighting will. Most people were not only unskilled in handling firearms but also had too much ineffective shooting. They couldn't hold on when there was slight danger, and fleeing occurred even when resisting relying on fortifications. If it happened in the wild, it's hard to say what would happen.

2. Extremely poor organization. Except for military team members who could effectively follow the command of group leaders to fight, the Military Team could hardly command the temporarily organized masses. "A rabble", He Ming said so at the summary meeting.

3. Regarding protection, the equipment of steel helmets + stab-resistant clothing proved to be effective. But the problem exposed in this battle was that the protection area was too small, lacking protection for limbs and face. Further protective products need to be developed.

4. Strategy was too cautious, confining oneself to Bairen Beach, not utilizing one's advantages in firepower, communication, and mobility to attack actively, causing a situation of passively taking beatings.

5. The fortification of Bairen City is obviously insufficient and needs to be strengthened.

But the focus of the meeting was the strategic policy for the next step.

The moderates still insisted on taking two points and one line as the main activity center, strengthening base defense, and after creating a fait accompli, focusing on industrial and technological development to form a complete urban and industrial-agricultural system. Using abundant materials, superior life, and advanced technology to form a "beacon effect", attracting local people to join circulation and construction, finally achieving the goal of "peaceful evolution".

The radicals ridiculed the moderates as true "turtle style". Clearly, their strength was three centuries greater than the opponent, yet they feared the enemy like a tiger, only shrinking behind trenches and barbed wire, daring not to fight for initiative. They reminded the other side that if they didn't attack actively and destroy the local Daming ruling center, Lingao's resources would never be used by us. And this ruling center would organize various hostile activities again and again.

"Lingao County can launch such a two-pronged attack today, and tomorrow maybe send people to sneak attack. They have done it before. And in the future, we will definitely leave the base and go farther and farther to collect various materials. Do we rely on the Military Team to escort every time?"

The radicals listed various benefits of occupying the county seat: First, capture a large amount of manpower in the county seat as labor; second, collect taxes and grain through captured tax and labor registers; and obtain a large amount of materials, money, and grain in the county treasury...

These benefits made many people start to be moved. Although the moderates cited historical materials and reality as weapons: telling them there were not many residents in the city to be caught as coolies, and according to the Ming Dynasty Lingao County Annals, this county had never been very wealthy, so there wouldn't be much material or grain in the county treasury.

At this time, Ma Qianzhu, the representative figure of the radicals, unexpectedly proposed to shelve this issue temporarily and focus on solving the training and organization problems exposed in this battle.

Training work was indeed blank: coming ashore for more than ten days, working every day, simply no time. Live-fire target practice was done only once. Everyone firing five bullets made the Planning Committee scream in distress. Five hundred people meant two thousand five hundred bullets. The biggest loss for the transmigrators in this battle was their bullet consumption. In this battle that lasted less than an hour, almost three thousand bullets were consumed. This was really a considerable number. And the total inventory of bullets was only one million rounds... If such training and small battles used so many bullets, how to fight the subsequent battles? When can metal fixed-loading bullets be produced?

As for the organization problem, it was obviously directly related to insufficient military training. Xiao Zishan proposed at the meeting: various professional groups performed well in the battle, which was obviously the result of working together usually and being familiar with each other. The problem mainly came from those so-called "basic labor groups" temporarily organized every day. At the beginning of establishment, such groups had fixed establishments, but the actual situation was that they were temporarily formed every day according to the allocation of the human resources department. As a result, everyone was unfamiliar with each other and lacked trust. Working usually was fine, but it was difficult to unite when encountering critical situations.

After discussion, the Executive Committee reiterated the group plan: All transmigrators, except for family units, single people should establish fixed four-person groups based on free combination, with each group electing a group leader to be responsible, participating in labor together, and housing arranged in the same dormitory as much as possible. Promote friendship through eating, living, and working together—relationships between dorm brothers in university are relatively ironclad.

Each group is issued an SKS rifle as group equipment. In this way, everyone has the opportunity to practice with rifles usually, avoiding issuing guns only during wartime when everyone is unfamiliar with weapons, and also preventing the situation of gun control loss caused by everyone having a rifle.

Taking these groups as basic units, a certain amount of time is set aside every week for military training to enhance the level of coordination between each other. Immediately after, Bei Wei threw out a new training plan: "Hunting".

"Every time our Military Team dispatches 5 people, bringing 2-3 ordinary groups," he explained the plan in detail, "Break away from our current mode of only acting along the Wenlan River, conduct reconnaissance into the depth in all directions, correct maps, and check various resources—"

When moving, the group will capture single or small groups of pedestrians. When necessary, attack various local armed personnel. Train the team through combat, training while walking, which is closer to actual combat than walking in formation and target practice in the base. Spread the authority of transmigrators to every corner of the county, let the common people know their arrival, and spread necessary terror.

This plan obviously carried a bloody smell, but the moderates decided not to oppose. After all, the reality of twenty-one injured people was there. If this plan was rejected, the radicals would inevitably re-introduce the proposal to attack Lingao county seat. With the current mood, the moderates did not think they would win in the voting. Finally, the moderates agreed to this "hunting" plan as a compromise for the radicals not to propose capturing the county seat anymore.
