# Chapter 693 - The Beginning of Pacification

The war on Hainan Island continued—though it could hardly be called war anymore. Everywhere, cities surrendered at the first sign of approach. Some county seats hadn't formally opened their gates, but one after another, Post-Disaster Management Bureaus had been established. Then the Fubogun surrounded Haikou Garrison, and the Navy blockaded Baisha Naval Camp from the sea. The typewriter on the torpedo boat quickly crushed Tang Yunwen's last hope of a decisive naval battle. After losing six warships and over a dozen fire ships, all activity from Baisha Naval Camp ceased completely. The Ming's last force on Hainan Island was divided and encircled—neither able nor willing to fight.

Qiongshan County was still under siege, though the Executive Committee refrained from launching an assault, considering the final negotiations. But negotiations with those in the city were already secretly underway. The Hainan Circuit Intendant Zhao Ruyi was not in the city. With the support of the County Magistrate and local gentry, the Prefect was conducting surrender activities without hindrance.

Across Hainan Island, except for the perpetually isolated southern prefectures, the Ming's prestige had plummeted. Gentry everywhere sent representatives to make contact, indicating they would provide money or grain—as long as their local safety was guaranteed.

Almost overnight, the Yuan Laoyuan's reputation was established over everyone on the entire island. The gentry realized that regardless of how many years the Ming had ruled, at least on Hainan Island, new masters were about to take over.

The gentry and great households weren't worried about the new masters—whoever came to be their master would govern by the old methods.

As for Ming officials, there was nothing to worry about. If they didn't plan to die for the city, they could continue serving in the county yamen. Some officials even sent special envoys for secret discussions on how both sides could continue to get along.

"These officials really are shameless." Xiong Buyou complained as he saw off another batch of envoys. "I can understand the gentry and great households—after all, they have property and businesses. They can't carry their houses on their backs."

"What's wrong?" Liu Muzhou was already buried in a mountain of documents. "Do officials really serve the people, serve the Emperor? The key is serving themselves! What's strange about that?"

"Today, unprecedentedly, three groups came." Xiong Buyou held up fingers. "First, a group from the County Magistrate, naturally wanting us to ensure he can continue serving as an official—whether Ming or ours. Then a group from the county's Chief Constable, indicating that if made County Magistrate, he'd definitely do better. Finally, some local magnate of unknown background, also wanting an official position. He even prostrated himself and shouted 'Long live the Australian-Song Emperor' three times..."

"Didn't he shout 'Long live Chairman Wen'?"

"He shouted 'Long live, long live, long, long live Chairman Wen.'"

"Isn't that good? It shows hearts are turning to us..."

"These hearts are really shameless."

"Every era has its discontented. If everyone sincerely loved and enthusiastically supported, were fully satisfied with their situation, had five times the happiness—would latecomers like us still have a chance?"

Thus, Hainan Island's situation developed by leaps and bounds. The blazing Hainan situation dealt a fatal blow to Guangdong's officialdom.

News of the Ming army's crushing defeat in Hainan soon reached Guangdong. Wang Zunde's already gradually weakening body couldn't withstand this heavy blow. He fell ill.

For convenient coordination of military operations and supplies, Wang Zunde had brought his staff and subordinate officials to Guangzhou when the cross-strait military action began. There was a wealthy man's garden near Bai'etan along the Pearl River, where he established his temporary headquarters.

The first news of defeat came from an urgent dispatch from the Qiongzhou Prefect. He still half-doubted reports of the front-line defeat. After all, this was an army assembled with the entire province's strength. If they still couldn't win, he simply couldn't imagine what would happen next.

Then, news of defeat came one after another from Hainan, each more definite than the last. The government army was utterly defeated at Chengmai, the entire force annihilated, numerous commissioned military officers killed. This news struck like a thunderbolt, dealing a heavy blow to Wang Zunde's spirit. Then, news that the bald bandits had captured Danzhou and were besieging Haikou Garrison and Qiongzhou Prefecture drove him into complete despair.

From scattered stragglers who had fled back from Hainan and been captured, and from He Rubin and others' evasive dispatches, he learned the bald bandits not only had fearsome firearms but also extremely powerful forces.

Soon, there was no more military business to handle in Guangzhou. News from Hainan was completely cut off. Bald bandit warships had blockaded the Qiongzhou Strait; government ships could no longer enter.

Rumors spread faster than anything in official circles. Everyone knew: Wang Zunde was finished. Not only would the Emperor never allow such a catastrophic defeat, but his political enemies and rivals in both the court and local government wouldn't pass up this excellent opportunity. Many were already secretly discussing when Wang Zunde would be dismissed or even arrested and sent to the capital.

Official circles were the most fickle. In this situation, he became a Governor no one bothered with in Guangzhou. Besides his staff, no one came to discuss anything with him. Even the Guangzhou Prefect and the magistrates of both counties became neglectful. Unable to bear it, he moved back to Zhaoqing.

There was likewise nothing to do in Zhaoqing. His complexion became haggard. Worn out from travel, he fell ill shortly after arriving at Zhaoqing.

Dispatch reports and documents continued arriving at the Governor-General's yamen, but the staff were rarely summoned to discuss the next military strategy. Actually, the staff all knew clearly: Guangdong's military strength was empty—besides the anti-Yao garrison generals in the eastern and western mountains, Guangdong had no organized forces left.

His condition worsened day by day under such anxiety. What worried him most was whether the bald bandits would take advantage of the situation to attack Guangzhou—if so, Guangdong had almost no troops left to resist.

Before many days had passed, dispatch reports said strangely-shaped vessels were prowling at the mouth of the Pearl River. These ships sailed swiftly, with slender hulls, completely different from Chinese ships or the red-haired barbarians' ships—obviously Australian fast ships.

The impending crisis forced him to prop himself up. He summoned his staff several times to discuss countermeasures and strengthen Pearl River defenses.

This day his spirits were slightly better. He was opening and reading documents in his study. Investigating Censor Gao Shunqin had sent a document. He had submitted a memorial requesting blockade of the Gulf of Guangzhou and completely cutting off trade with the Portuguese in Macao "to eliminate the brigands."

Wang Zunde could only smile bitterly at this—if the Australians came to attack Guangzhou, the Portuguese in Macao were probably the only naval force he could count on to defend the Pearl River mouth. What was the point of talking about "eliminating brigands" now? The Australians—an even larger band of brigands—were about to arrive.

"My Lord, Secretary Li has arrived," a servant said quietly.

He said weakly: "Show him in!"

Li Xijue entered. Since Lü Yizhong had gone out with the army, he had become Wang Zunde's most capable and trusted staff member. Often, only he could see the Governor-General.

Wang Zunde had tea served and forced a calm smile. Li Xijue's face was pale. After sitting down, he observed the commander's expression and leaned forward to ask:

"Has Your Excellency's health improved?"

Wang Zunde smiled and shook his head. "Just a minor cold, nothing serious." Seeing Li Xijue holding a document, he asked: "What document is that?"

Li Xijue answered nervously: "A secret letter from Lingao—"

"What?" Wang Zunde's fingers began trembling. "Who wrote it?"

"Master Lü." Li Xijue said in a disdainful yet nervous tone. "The letter arrived yesterday. Since Your Excellency was bedridden, this humble official read it first."

Wang Zunde's fingers tremored as he took the document. "Secretary Lü... is he...?"

"He's still alive. He became the Australians' prisoner." Li Xijue couldn't help but sigh. "The letter goes into great detail."

Wang Zunde finished reading the document with trembling hands, then could no longer contain himself. Disregarding the dignity of a high-ranking official, he threw the letter violently to the floor.

"Outrageous! Such a shameless scoundrel!"

Li Xijue, seeing his flushed face and rapid breathing, feared he would make himself sick with anger and quickly tried to soothe him. The Governor-General's personal servant also ran in, wanting to help him back to his inner chamber to rest.

"No need, I'm fine!" Wang Zunde shook his head and said with deep sorrow, "I never imagined this person would be so shameless—neither dying for his country nor remaining a steadfast prisoner. To actually write such a letter!"

"Please calm your anger, Your Excellency." Li Xijue hastened to console him. "The letter wasn't written in Master Lü's own hand, only stamped with his personal seal. Furthermore, with Master Lü imprisoned, even if he wrote it, there were surely many compelled aspects. For now, examining the letter's contents is most important!"

Whether Lü Yizhong wrote the letter, whether it represented his true intentions—none of that mattered. The key was that this secret letter revealed the Australians' intentions.

Since the Australians were willing to communicate through Lü Yizhong, matters could still be worked out. It didn't have to come to armed conflict—the government army couldn't afford another defeat.

The letter's contents were divided into several sections. First, Guangdong was to ransom prisoners. For captured officers and staff, the Australians had already set prices according to rank. For example, a *bazong* cost ten taels of silver. Beyond the ransom, each prisoner owed a daily fee of one *qian* of silver for meals and lodging—calculated by days spent in the Lingao POW camp. In other words, the sooner you redeemed them, the more you saved. Otherwise, the "late fees" would become astronomical.

Second were matters regarding bilateral peace talks. Lü Yizhong conveyed in the letter: the Australians originally had no designs on the Ming—they merely sought a place to trade and reside. Yet they had been attacked by government forces and suffered heavy losses. Now the Australians were very angry, preparing to bring dozens more great iron ships from Australia to attack Guangzhou.

But armed conflict meant losses on both sides. Especially since the Australians had come for trade, not to seize territory. Therefore, the Australians hoped to negotiate with the government "to extinguish the flames of war."
