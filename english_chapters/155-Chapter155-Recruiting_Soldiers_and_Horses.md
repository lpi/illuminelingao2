# Chapter 155: Recruiting Soldiers and Horses

"Once the Army and Navy are formally established—not only will weapon demand surge—training and ammunition storage are also issues." Ma Qianzhu said. "Two points."

The Industrial Department must quickly establish ammunition supply systems for New Army and coastal fortress training.

Black powder supply was ample—a 2.5-ton stockpile. Granulation treatment had greatly improved power. Sufficient for training and combat. But shells and Minié balls were zero stock—needed rush production.

Weapon manufacturing: focus on one or two types. Don't be greedy. If coke shortage caused steel shortage—concentrate on cast-iron cannons for now. The Trade Department would fully address coal supply.

Must urgently manufacture prime movers—including steam engines and small diesels. Providing sufficient power machinery for the Navy's ship construction and modification.

"Naval ships—" Chen Haiyang reminded, "currently only two sailships. Tasks are too many. The Navy needs more ships."

To meet current fishing, patrol, and transport needs—the Navy required at least 8–10 sailships. Displacement: minimum 50 tons, preferably 100+. Industrial seaborne demand was growing—small ships were impractical.

Travelers had already discovered sizable boatyards at Lingao. The largest local vessels were called "Lingao draggers"—70+ ton displacement. Usable for fishing and cargo—but transmigrators considered them slightly small, too slow.

Building ships themselves: the Industrial Department and Navy could propose countless designs—even someone who'd drawn *Gloire* ironclad's lines and structure existed. But nobody had actual shipbuilding experience. Most experienced: Wen-Director and Wang Luobin—veteran ship model enthusiasts who'd built countless models. Deepest wooden-structure shipbuilding understanding.

Chen Haiyang proposed using Lingao's local shipbuilding resources. Per Long-Range Recon's report: Lingao's Baitu Harbor had several boatyards—capable of ordinary fishing boats and even 400-*liao* large ships. 400-*liao* was Ming's maximum civilian legal shipbuilding size.

Baitu Harbor had not just shipwrights—but substantial seasoned timber, some stored 3–4 years with proper dryness. Travelers could conveniently use these.

"I propose we occupy Baitu Harbor. Relocate all shipwrights and materials to Bopu." Travelers would design while teaching modern techniques—quickly transforming shipwrights into modern workers.

"Agreed!" Zhang Bailin immediately supported—enthusiastic about any military action.

"I also support Baitu occupation. This controls Lingao's entire shipbuilding industry. Lingao's fishermen and coastal shippers would be completely dependent on us." Ma Qianzhu also supported.

Baitu occupation was approved—to commence after the Army Training Battalion was formed.

"Finally: Navy personnel recruitment and training." The Navy's Li Haiping said. "Ma-Commissioner mentioned Army handling this—I disagree. We're Navy, not Army Marines. Navy has specialized needs—Army can't truly understand—"

The Army's young turks—Wei Aiwen, Zhang Bailin—immediately looked displeased: clear implication that Army were bumpkins.

"Let me clarify." Ma Qianzhu hastened. "Army responsibility is the recruit phase—Army has Training Battalion. Post-assignment, Navy handles its own training. As for soldier recruitment: future centralized under Military Committee—unrelated to Army or Navy."

"Chief." Another commune member timidly entered Wu De's Bairren Commune office.

"What is it?" Wu De was surprised—another enlistment referral?

"I, I want a document." The visitor seemed afraid addressing such an important chief.

"Joining the military?"

"Y-yes—"

Wu De sighed. Today alone, twenty-plus had come for enlistment referrals. Plus recent Mechanical Plant and other department recruitments—fifty full-labor males were gone. More of this and the commune would become a women's village.

Military benefits were perhaps too good. Wu De thought: 200kg rice settling allowance, 1-*liang* monthly salary, room and board—no wonder commune members wanted to enlist.

"Chuyu, issue his certificate." Wu De said wearily. Still had to serve the bigger picture. Current priority was military expansion.

"Yes, Master." Chuyu had become the unofficial commune secretary. After vetting and probation—at her insistence—she was assigned to Wu De. At the commune, she naturally took charge of his daily life. Finding cafeteria food unsatisfactory, she cooked herself—daily meals and laundry. Repeatedly hinting she could do more. Wu De hadn't expected: a has-been middle-aged man in the 21st century—in this timespace, young girls admired him. No wonder so many otaku infiltrated the expedition.

Actually, Chuyu was semi-literate—night school after joining the transmigrators only achieved partial literacy. "Documents" meant stamping pre-printed, pre-filled forms—hence "stamp secretary."

His phone suddenly rang—Li Haiping calling:

"Old Wu, our Navy's recruitment isn't going well. Army's hogging all the best physiques. Any ideas? You're also a Navy veteran—"

"Alright, I'll promote when people apply."

"Much appreciated! When writing referrals—specify Navy reporting."

Recruiting solely from the commune would severely deplete labor. Recruitment manager Xi Yazhou established a station at bustling East Gate Market.

The recruitment name wasn't "Transmigration Army"—but respectable "Bairren Militia." County authorities completely played dumb. Traditional bureaucratic wisdom: when you should be an ostrich—bury your head deep. Not knowing was better than knowing but not acting. Travelers had no concerns about the nearly naked Lingao county yamen taking action.

"Damn—these benefits are too high?" Dongmen Chuiyu was on site maintaining recruitment order at East Gate Market. Looking at the large recruitment poster just hung on the screen wall: 2-*dan* (200kg) settling grain per soldier, room and board (20kg monthly ration), 1-*liang* silver monthly.

But Xi Yazhou said benefits weren't high. Tianqi-era Liaodong garrisons already paid 2-*liang* monthly. By mid-Chongzhen, new recruits' monthly pay rose to 3.2-*liang*. If not for Ming military's endemic skimming—soldiers barely receiving anything—transmigrators would need 2-*liang* to attract anyone.

Zhang Bailin was under the screen wall recruiting locals—now understanding some Lingao dialect.

"Brother, join our militia. One-*liang* monthly—even regulars don't get that. Plus room and board."

"Soldiering? No way—lose your head."

"Don't leave—three meals daily, salary too. Consider it?"

"I have wife and kids. Please spare me, Chief."

"Bring family—we cover the settling allowance."

...

Per the Military Committee's plan: Army recruited 400 soldiers, 100 cadets. Navy: 100 soldiers, 100 cadets. Soldiers: ages 17–25. Cadets: 13–16. Cadets were the future technical backbone—besides military training, receiving specialized skill development.

During recruitment, most applicants didn't know their ages—giving rough years only. Some didn't even know there'd been a Tianqi era—thinking "Emperor Wanli" still reigned. Appearance: all dark and thin—hard to judge actual ages. Later, the Medical Group developed dental examination procedures—still approximate. Planned youth cadets: only about a dozen recruited.

Lingao locals weren't enthusiastic. If not small freeholders, they were somewhat established tenants. Though struggling—they could fill their stomachs. Naturally uninterested in soldiering. But "Fulao" outsiders—migrants to Hainan for reclamation or labor—applied more. Mostly single—no attachments.

Some obviously overage, destitute types also came to enlist. All accepted—older ones served logistics. Currently the transmigrators needed population explosion. More people solved everything.

But such soldiers were universally small—long-term malnutrition and hard labor had damaged health. Though enduring hardship, weight and strength tests exceeded their physiques.

"A bit short. Not sturdy enough." Wei Aiwen was disappointed. These small natives didn't match his military appearance aesthetics. Commune applicants, better fed, had excellent physiques, first-rate spirit—Wei Aiwen unhesitatingly filed them under Army enlistment.

"Short is short—strong and resilient." Xi Yazhou wasn't picky. But height standards were already lowered to 155cm—truly minimal. Many still looked bony. 20kg monthly rations enough for them? Xi Yazhou worried.

The Navy discovered Army was skimming the best physiques from enlistees. They demanded opening another Bopu station—promoting Navy benefits to fishermen. Fishermen were clearly more adventurous than farmers. Plus the Navy's famed iron ship and "fast ships"—recruiting 100+ was easy. Some even came from neighboring counties. Chen Haiyang was initially delighted—then realized: not Navy's superior appeal, but to worldly fishermen, joining a maritime group for piracy was already part of their livelihood. If things went well—stay permanently. Joining "Australian Baldies" wasn't different from joining the Zheng family. Looking at these half-fishing, half-pirate recruits—future political work needed real effort.
