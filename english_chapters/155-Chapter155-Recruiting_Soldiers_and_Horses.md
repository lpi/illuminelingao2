# Chapter 155: Recruiting Soldiers and Horses

"Once Army and Navy are formally established—not only will weapon-demand surge—training and ammunition-storage are also issues." Ma Qianzhu said. "Two points."

Industrial-Department must quickly establish ammunition-supply systems for New Army and coastal-fortress training.

Black-powder supply was ample—2.5-ton stockpile. Granulation-treatment greatly-improved power. Sufficient for training and combat. But shells and Minié-balls were zero-stock—needed rush-production.

Weapon-manufacturing: focus on one-two types. Don't be greedy. If coke-shortage caused steel-shortage—concentrate on cast-iron cannons for now. Trade-Department would fully-address coal-supply.

Must urgently manufacture prime-movers—including steam-engines and small-diesels. Providing sufficient power-machinery for Navy's ship-construction and modification.

"Naval ships—" Chen Haiyang reminded, "currently only two sailships. Tasks are too many. Navy needs more ships."

To meet current fishing, patrol, and transport needs—Navy required at least 8–10 sailships. Displacement: minimum 50 tons, preferably 100+. Industrial seaborne-demand was growing—small ships were impractical.

Travelers had already discovered sizable boatyards at Lingao. Largest local-vessels were called "Lingao-draggers"—70+ ton displacement. Usable for fishing and cargo—but transmigrators considered them slightly-small, too-slow.

Building ships themselves: Industrial-Department and Navy could propose countless designs—even someone who'd drawn *Gloire* ironclad's lines and structure existed. But nobody had actual-shipbuilding experience. Most-experienced: Wen-Director and Wang Luobin—veteran ship-model enthusiasts who'd built countless models. Deepest wooden-structure shipbuilding understanding.

Chen Haiyang proposed using Lingao's local shipbuilding-resources. Per Long-Range Recon's report: Lingao's Baitu-Harbor had several boatyards—capable of ordinary-fishing-boats and even 400-*liao* large-ships. 400-*liao* was Ming's maximum civilian-legal shipbuilding size.

Baitu-Harbor had not just shipwrights—but substantial seasoned-timber, some stored 3–4 years with proper-dryness. Travelers could conveniently-use these.

"I propose we occupy Baitu-Harbor. Relocate all shipwrights and materials to Bopu." Travelers would design while teaching modern-techniques—quickly transforming shipwrights into modern-workers.

"Agreed!" Zhang Bailin immediately-supported—enthusiastic about any military-action.

"I also support Baitu-occupation. This controls Lingao's entire shipbuilding-industry. Lingao's fishermen and coastal-shippers would be completely dependent on us." Ma Qianzhu also-supported.

Baitu-occupation was approved—to commence after Army Training-Battalion was formed.

"Finally: Navy personnel recruitment and training." Navy's Li Haiping said. "Ma-Commissioner mentioned Army handling this—I disagree. We're Navy, not Army-Marines. Navy has specialized-needs—Army can't truly understand—"

Army's young-turks—Wei Aiwen, Zhang Bailin—immediately looked displeased: clear implication that Army were bumpkins.

"Let me clarify." Ma Qianzhu hastened. "Army-responsibility is recruit-phase—Army has Training-Battalion. Post-assignment, Navy handles its own training. As for soldier-recruitment: future centralized under Military-Committee—unrelated to Army or Navy."

"Chief." Another commune-member timidly entered Wu De's Bairren-Commune office.

"What is it?" Wu De was surprised—another enlistment-referral?

"I, I want a document." The visitor seemed afraid addressing such important-chiefs.

"Joining the military?"

"Y-yes—"

Wu De sighed. Today alone, twenty-plus had come for enlistment-referrals. Plus recent Mechanical-Plant and other-department recruitments—fifty full-labor males were gone. More of this and the commune would become women's-village.

Military-benefits were perhaps too-good. Wu De thought: 200kg rice settling-allowance, 1-*liang* monthly-salary, room-and-board—no wonder commune-members wanted to enlist.

"Chuyu, issue his certificate." Wu De said wearily. Still had to serve the bigger-picture. Current-priority was military-expansion.

"Yes, Master." Chuyu had become unofficial commune-secretary. After vetting and probation—at her insistence—she was assigned to Wu De. At the commune, she naturally took charge of his daily-life. Finding cafeteria-food unsatisfactory, she cooked herself—daily meals and laundry. Repeatedly hinting she could do more. Wu De hadn't expected: a has-been middle-aged man in 21st-century—in this timespace, young-girls admired him. No wonder so many otaku infiltrated the expedition.

Actually, Chuyu was semi-literate—night-school after joining transmigrators only achieved partial-literacy. "Documents" meant stamping pre-printed, pre-filled forms—hence "stamp-secretary."

His phone suddenly rang—Li Haiping calling:

"Old Wu, our Navy's recruitment isn't going well. Army's hogging all the best-physiques. Any ideas? You're also Navy-veteran—"

"Alright, I'll promote when people apply."

"Much appreciated! When writing referrals—specify Navy-reporting."

Recruiting solely from commune would severely-deplete labor. Recruitment-manager Xi Yazhou established a station at bustling East Gate Market.

Recruitment-name wasn't "Transmigration-Army"—but respectable "Bairren Militia." County-authorities completely played-dumb. Traditional-bureaucratic wisdom: when you should be an ostrich—bury your head deep. Not-knowing was better than knowing-but-not-acting. Travelers had no concerns about nearly-naked Lingao-county-yamen taking action.

"Damn—these benefits are too-high?" Dongmen Chuiyu was on-site maintaining recruitment-order at East Gate Market. Looking at the large recruitment-poster just hung on the screen-wall: 2-*dan* (200kg) settling-grain per soldier, room-and-board (20kg monthly-ration), 1-*liang* silver monthly.

But Xi Yazhou said benefits weren't high. Tianqi-era Liaodong-garrisons already paid 2-*liang* monthly. By mid-Chongzhen, new-recruits' monthly-pay rose to 3.2-*liang*. If not for Ming-military's endemic-skimming—soldiers barely receiving anything—transmigrators would need 2-*liang* to attract anyone.

Zhang Bailin was under the screen-wall recruiting locals—now understanding some Lingao-dialect.

"Brother, join our militia. One-*liang* monthly—even regulars don't get that. Plus room-and-board."

"Soldiering? No way—lose your head."

"Don't leave—three-meals daily, salary too. Consider it?"

"I have wife and kids. Please spare me, Chief."

"Bring family—we cover settling-allowance."

...

Per Military-Committee's plan: Army recruited 400 soldiers, 100 cadets. Navy: 100 soldiers, 100 cadets. Soldiers: ages 17–25. Cadets: 13–16. Cadets were future technical-backbone—besides military-training, receiving specialized-skill development.

During recruitment, most applicants didn't know their ages—giving rough-years only. Some didn't even know there'd been a Tianqi-era—thinking "Emperor Wanli" still reigned. Appearance: all dark and thin—hard to judge actual-ages. Later, Medical-Group developed dental-examination procedures—still approximate. Planned youth-cadets: only about a dozen recruited.

Lingao-locals weren't enthusiastic. If not small-freeholders, they were somewhat-established tenants. Though struggling—they could fill their stomachs. Naturally uninterested in soldiering. But "Fulao" outsiders—migrants to Hainan for reclamation or labor—applied more. Mostly single—no attachments.

Some obviously-overage, destitute types also came to enlist. All accepted—older ones served logistics. Currently transmigrators needed population-explosion. More people solved everything.

But such soldiers were universally-small—long-term malnutrition and hard-labor had damaged health. Though enduring hardship, weight-strength-tests exceeded their physiques.

"A bit short. Not sturdy enough." Wei Aiwen was disappointed. These small natives didn't match his military-appearance aesthetics. Commune-applicants, better-fed, had excellent-physiques, first-rate spirit—Wei Aiwen unhesitatingly filed them under Army-enlistment.

"Short is short—strong and resilient." Xi Yazhou wasn't picky. But height-standards were already lowered to 155cm—truly minimal. Many still looked bony. 20kg monthly-rations enough for them? Xi Yazhou worried.

Navy discovered Army was skimming best-physiques from enlistees. They demanded opening another Bopu-station—promoting Navy-benefits to fishermen. Fishermen were clearly more adventurous than farmers. Plus Navy's famed iron-ship and "fast-ships"—recruiting 100+ was easy. Some even came from neighboring-counties. Chen Haiyang was initially-delighted—then realized: not Navy's superior-appeal, but to worldly-fishermen, joining a maritime-group for piracy was already part of their livelihood. If things went well—stay permanently. Joining "Australian Baldies" wasn't different from joining Zheng-family. Looking at these half-fishing, half-pirate recruits—future political-work needed real-effort.
