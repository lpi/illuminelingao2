# Chapter 2565 - Xunyang Tower

The attendees welcomed Elder Zhang Xiao with warm applause.

This wasn't Zhang Xiao's first public appearance in Guangzhou, but this time was particularly formal. Because those attending were all people "with faces and status" among the local natives. The numbers weren't large, but they represented the wealthiest, most cultured, and most influential group in the city.

These people, in contemporary European cities, would be called "citizens." Their numbers were few, but they held the city's affairs in their hands.

Zhang Xiao had already reviewed the list of attendees. Half were "new money" and "activists" they had supported, while another two-thirds were "non-committal" individuals. They submitted to the new rule but had no enthusiasm for the new regime—some even harbored a certain hostility. In a sense, they were all potential troublemakers.

Yet these very people still enjoyed high prestige and influence among the common people. The Elders who wanted to "take their place" still had a long road ahead.

Even the self-proclaimed Senate that challenged heaven and earth, after entering Guangzhou and riding the momentum of a few cases to sweep in all directions, now likewise had to hold their noses and "cooperate" with these people.

"Deep roots and flourishing branches"—this truly wasn't an empty phrase, Zhang Xiao thought to himself.

Thinking of this, he flashed a smile at the audience below and said in a measured, cadenced voice: "Citizens of Guangzhou..."

Kuang Lu's residence in Guangzhou, called Haixue Hall, was located in Xianlin Lane near the Temple of the Five Immortals, only a stone's throw from the Nanhai Academy. He too had come here today. He had entered the county school at thirteen—a true child prodigy. His lack of examination success was simply because his ambitions didn't lie in the civil service examinations. Now that the world south of the Lingnan mountains had undergone tremendous change and the thousand-year Confucian tradition had been swept away, the Nanhai Academy had become a constant worry in his heart.

In former days of leisure at home, he would often come here to stroll. Originally, as a Nanhai County licentiate, going to the academy was a perfectly natural thing.

But after the Australians came, this place had become an Australian school and some kind of "Education Bureau." Watching the place he had frequented since childhood now become a gathering spot for "crop-haired short-coated types," Kuang Lu felt secret resentment but was helpless. He could only feel this had become a place of heartbreak and refused to visit anymore.

Today at noon he had drunk a few cups more than usual. Suddenly inspired, he thought to take a tour of this Nanhai County academy.

The academy now didn't prohibit ordinary people from entering and exiting. Only the courtyard used by the Education Bureau for offices was closed to visitors; other areas were open for touring without strict security. Someone like him, an old neighbor and local celebrity, was known to the gatekeepers, who naturally wouldn't stop him.

Thoroughly familiar with this place he had played in since childhood, Kuang Lu unconsciously arrived at the Zunxin Pavilion. The former green-brick outer wall had long been whitewashed with lime by the Australians, and the Confucian classics inside had been swept clean, replaced with all manner of Great Song books—it had become an Australian library.

Looking back at the plum blossoms blooming in the garden, Kuang Lu, moved by the times, his heart full of worry yet not knowing where to begin, heaved a long sigh. Picking up a stone from the ground, he began writing on the white wall of the Zunxin Pavilion. The poem read:

*The realm south of the peaks has truly sunk*
*The true dragon lies shallowed in heart of mountains and seas*
*Three rivers, ten memorials—always cooking jade*
*Four bare walls, no refuge—still pawning the qin*

*Plunging into the sea, can it contain a noble's honor*
*Gazing homeward, forever pained by songs of Yue*
*If the passes should ever seal with clay again*
*Looking back: plum blossoms deep amid frontier grass*

Having finished writing, Kuang Lu still stood by the wall, gazing at the sky, moved by the times and filled with grief. Just as he was lost in bitter emotion, suddenly an angry shout came from behind:

"What are you doing!"

Kuang Lu was startled. He spun around, but his pupils couldn't help contracting. "It's him!"

Huang Xiyin was also startled. He hadn't expected that enemies on a narrow road would bring him face to face with this wild and unrestrained Kuang Lu again.

Kuang Lu had thought Huang Xiyin, as Nanhai County Magistrate, should have died for his country when the city fell. He hadn't expected to encounter him here today—he must have gone over to the Australians and become a traitor selling out his country. Kuang Lu's heart sank. He sneered: "The prodigal meets the Huayin Magistrate again; mules and horses have become homeless curs."

"You!" Huang Xiyin still remembered the Lantern Festival three years ago, when Kuang Lu had mocked him with "Riding the donkey, happened to meet the Huayin Magistrate; lost the horse, still like the old man of the frontier." Being provoked by Kuang Lu again now, he trembled with rage and couldn't get a word out.

"Magistrate Huang, you're looking well!" Kuang Lu said with deliberate politeness.

Huang Xiyin finally calmed his heart and said: "And who might this be? Ah—the unlearned and unskilled young Kuang!"

"Being unlearned and unskilled is still better than going over to the enemy and selling out one's country!"

Huang Xiyin said: "I know the Kuang family is entirely loyal and righteous. Your cousin Kuang Zhuolüe followed Yuan Chonghuan and died on the Liaodong battlefield. Unfortunately, alas, Yuan Chonghuan ended up being sliced to death by a thousand cuts, and Kuang Zhuolüe's heroic blood was spilled in vain! Your Kuang family's loyalty was all fed to that dog Chongzhen! Ha ha ha..."

How could Kuang Lu endure this? Insulting him was one thing; even calling the Emperor a dog was acceptable. But humiliating his elder cousin who had died for his country was absolutely unacceptable. His rage erupted at once. In three steps he was upon Huang Xiyin and landed a right hook on his left cheek.

Huang Xiyin was not only older than Kuang Lu but also a mere bookworm. How could he match Kuang Lu, a fierce warrior who had roamed the rivers and lakes with sword and books? He managed to block a few blows before he could no longer defend himself, howling in pain from the beating. The Zunxin Pavilion wasn't far from the former clerks' quarters, now the Education Bureau offices. The sounds of their scuffle quickly drew office staff.

"Stop!" Suddenly a sturdy hand clamped down like pincers from behind on Kuang Lu's raised right hand.

Kuang Lu's left hand still gripped Huang Xiyin's collar. He had to release it temporarily. Spinning around, he threw a left hook, but the man behind him nimbly ducked.

The man delivered a strike to the ribs and chest. Kuang Lu took a solid hit and slowed down. The man seized the opportunity to slip to Kuang Lu's side, swept his knee, and Kuang Lu's right leg buckled. Taking advantage of this, the opponent pulled both of Kuang Lu's hands behind him, pressed a knee against his back, and cleanly subdued him on the ground.

After this sequence of Bōbō Army grappling technique, Nanhai County Education Director Tian Liang finally called out: "Quick, someone! There's a brawl here!"

No matter how Kuang Lu struggled, he couldn't break free of Tian Liang's hold. Though Kuang Lu had been skilled in martial arts since childhood, when it came to combat experience against Tian Liang—an old soldier who had been crossing bayonets since the Chengmai Campaign—he was showing off before an expert.

National Army soldiers arrived in response. With several sabers leveled at his face, however capable Kuang Lu was, he knew this was a loss he couldn't afford right now.

Huang Xiyin, struggling to rise from the ground, had blood at the corner of his mouth, bruises everywhere on his head, and black circles around his eyes like a panda. He looked utterly wretched. Straightening his robes, he stepped forward and slapped Kuang Lu on the head, shouting: "How dare you act up! How dare you be so arrogant!"

"Councillor Huang, stop hitting him. Just hand this man over to the police," Tian Liang mediated.

"Director Tian, you don't understand. This villain has written seditious poetry right here on the walls of the Education Bureau!" Huang Xiyin pointed at the library's white outer wall, planning to use this opportunity to thoroughly deal with this hateful fellow.

Since ancient times, writing seditious poetry was a grave offense. Huang Xiyin had only glanced at it but knew this defiant scholar had written seditious verse. Just the first line—"The realm south of the peaks has truly sunk, the true dragon lies shallowed in heart of mountains and seas"—couldn't be more seditious.

A cold smile appeared at the corner of his mouth. No matter how defiant you are! This isn't Ming territory anymore—there aren't so many connections to protect you here!

Tian Liang followed Huang Xiyin's pointing finger and looked at the wall. All he saw were several columns of wild, flourishing cursive text—he couldn't make out what they said at all. Kuang Lu's emotions had been running too high; the poem on the wall had been written in a burst of unrestrained cursive. Even Huang Xiyin, who fancied himself a calligraphy connoisseur, could only make out about forty or fifty percent. But he could guess it was a "seditious poem" lamenting the former dynasty.

"Alright, I understand. Hurry and call the security National Army to detain him." Tian Liang knew his cultural foundations were weak. These Ming literati's show-off calligraphy was such that even Elders could only recognize characters like "go spring pond reflected rhyme" and "wife woman of treasure"—how could a rough fellow like him, wearing this Nanhai County Director hat, have the nerve to show his ignorance in front of Huang Xiyin? He simply sent Huang Xiyin off to get help.

Soon two National Army soldiers came jogging over. Only when the man was being held by the two National Army soldiers did Tian Liang finally see clearly what this "rebel" from Huang Xiyin's mouth looked like.

"Mr. Kuang!" Tian Liang was somewhat surprised, murmuring to himself.

"The blockhead from Tanka Village!" Kuang Lu was also rather surprised. He thought to himself: who would have expected that slow-witted former headmaster to have such skills—truly, I underestimated these Baldy pirates.

With everyone watching, Tian Liang couldn't reveal that he and Kuang Lu knew each other. He only said: "The Nanhai Academy is an important government and school facility. Today there is also an important event. Do you know that causing disturbances here will land you in a cell?"

Kuang Lu laughed aloud: "This young master has been wild and free for twenty years—what scene haven't I witnessed? I'd quite like to see how Australian cells differ from Ming prisons."

"Save that talk for the police." Tian Liang waved his hand, having the National Army take him away.

"You've got nerve, kid. Don't you dare play dirty tricks. Sneak attacks don't make a hero! When I get out, dare you face me in a proper match?"

Kuang Lu was being hauled off by two sturdy soldiers, still shouting challenges at Tian Liang from a distance.

At the academy address venue, Zhang Xiao had finished his inaugural speech and most of the crowd had dispersed.

Chen Bangyan approached Chen Zizhuang's side and whispered in his ear: "Sir, Zhanruo has just been detained by the Bald... the Australians."

Chen Zizhuang's brow furrowed. He asked quietly: "What for?"

"Writing elegiac poetry on the walls of the Zunxin Pavilion. Also, assaulting Huang Xiyin, the new County Magistrate's councillor."

"Impulsive! Sigh..." Chen Zizhuang knew this matter could be made large or small. If the Baldy pirates intended to implicate others, even hundreds of people might not be beyond the realm of possibility. Moreover, nothing could go wrong at this juncture, lest all previous efforts be wasted. But he had never given the Australians a friendly face, so trying to pull strings for a favor was hopeless. It seemed he would have no choice but to impose on a certain examination classmate of many years' absence.
