# Chapter 128: Guangzhou Trip (Part 4)

The future blueprint Xiao Zishan drew for Qiwei Escort Bureau was essentially: restructure into an armed freight company. Late-Ming social order was already crumbling—long-distance transport was impossible without armed escorts.

Sun Kecheng was dumbfounded. Such grand claims—businesses extending wherever, bureau routes following! He didn't have that many martial brothers and disciples. Even the ubiquitous official, bandit, and local tyrant forces—he couldn't possibly cultivate relationships with all three.

"No problem." Xiao Zishan wasn't concerned. "For now, just open one new route—Guangzhou to Haikang and Xuwen."

"Haikang, Xuwen?" Sun Kecheng was puzzled. Haikang was Leizhou Prefecture's chief county; Xuwen was a subordinate county. Both were remote backwaters in Guangdong. Main products: salt and sugar. Few wealthy households. Australian merchants sold precious rarities—doing business in Leizhou would be losing money.

"Correct." Xiao Zishan nodded. Opening this route served two purposes: first, establishing land connections between Hainan and Guangzhou. Bopu Port faced Xuwen's Denglong Point directly across water. If sea routes were blocked, transmigrators could cross from Bopu, travel overland via Leizhou to Guangzhou. Second: obtaining local sugar. Leizhou Peninsula's climate and soil were ideal for sugarcane. Since Han Dynasty, sugar mills had existed. By Ming, local cultivation and sugar production were highly developed. Around 1700, crude sugar annual output reached 10,000 tons—mostly exported. Sugar was among Ming-Qing China's most profitable overseas trade goods—transmigrators couldn't ignore it. Though currently unable to directly control Leizhou Peninsula, establishing purchasing stations and securing supplies was still feasible.

What Xiao Zishan wanted from Qiwei Bureau: within one month, open branch offices in both Haikang and Xuwen. Subsequently, establish mule and horse inns or cart services at key villages along routes—forming relay-style transport lines. All funds for branch office establishment would be provided by them. Additionally, 3,000 *liang* for Qiwei—recruiting personnel, cultivating local officials, and covering miscellaneous expenses.

"One month is too tight." Sun Kecheng shook his head repeatedly. "Qiwei has no routes in Leizhou—needs scouts to blaze trails. Front to back, this takes two to three months."

"Two months then. This is urgent." Wu Nanhai had informed him: sugarcane harvest was autumn through winter. If routes could be opened in time, they could establish purchasing stations in Leizhou for this season—by next spring, they'd be mass-exporting white sugar. Transmigrators' export commodities would be secured.

"That's manageable." Sun Kecheng, however, didn't seem particularly excited. "Forgive my bluntness: you gentlemen come from afar. Leizhou is remote wilderness. Doing business there—please reconsider..."

Xiao Zishan was touched. In another timespace, countless people devised clever schemes to defraud funding—polishing others' work as their own, easily bilking billions in taxpayer money. This struggling bureau chief was urging him to "reconsider" his investment! Human character really varied enormously.

"No worries—we have our reasons." Xiao Zishan knew: without legitimate reasons, these upstanding bureau people couldn't be won over with money alone. Fortunately, sugar buying was ready-made: "Leizhou produces sugar. Australians desperately need sugarcane products. One round trip doubles capital. We want to establish purchasing stations in Leizhou."

Sun Kecheng suddenly understood—repeatedly praised their "foresight"—readily agreed. Xiao Zishan then made three requests: first, quickly recruit personnel and expand bureau ranks; second, help locate reliable local shop managers and clerks for opening businesses; third, establish a regular contact system. Gao Di's martial arts training at the bureau made him suitable. They agreed: Huifu Street and Bureau would communicate every seven days. Emergencies could be handled same-day. Arrangements settled, Xiao Zishan handed over bank drafts from Gao Ju. Partnership was thereby established.

Over the following days, Xiao Zishan shuttled between Qiwei Bureau and the Gao mansion. He needed locals' help for countless matters. He also witnessed Gao Ju's enormous influence as a Guangzhou merchant. Many issues required only sending a steward with his calling card—done. More convenient than modern leaders' handwritten notes or phone calls.

Quickly, Guo Yi and others' *baojia* (neighborhood registration) was completed—formally registering their residency. Actually, household registries and records were already defunct in late-Ming Guangzhou. *Baojia* was mainly a security measure. As for their origins—naturally, they couldn't claim Australian merchants. They were listed as Gao family townsmen. With Gao family stewards intervening, the semi-official local wardens dared not delay—immediately processing everything. Xiao Zishan knew these "minor officials"—whether past or present—were the trickiest. At critical moments, they could poison situations. He immediately produced a generous five *liang* tip packet. The recipient beamed—becoming ever more deferential.

Procurement delegation members—except a few guarding the ship—moved into the Huifu Street mansion. After two days' rest, everyone clamored to go sightseeing—see what this 17th-century southeastern metropolis looked like.

Xiao Zishan knew blocking them would only cause resentment—but letting them swarm out uncontrolled would definitely cause trouble. These people were too well-nourished; behavior didn't match surroundings. He divided them into five or six-person groups; each group accompanied by two Qiwei escorts for safety. Each person received one *liang* silver and 1,000 copper coins as pocket money.

Escorts, due to underworld and legitimate-world connections, had evolved a unique guarantee system. When underworld figures who'd "made friends" with bureaus entered cities for medical treatment, sightseeing, or shopping, bureaus would customarily send escorts to accompany them—good food, drink, entertainment—then politely escort them out. One condition: city visitors couldn't cause trouble. No crimes; not even visiting brothels or gambling houses—escorts didn't accompany. Underworld friends followed this rule. Over time, urban constables and investigators seeing outlaws with escorts customarily didn't question or search them. Xiao Zishan knew transmigrators were too conspicuous. Groups roaming would immediately attract yamen investigators. Escort accompaniment was more prudent.

Everyone excitedly departed. Bei Wei took several trainees—also escort-accompanied—but not for sightseeing. They were surveying Guangzhou's terrain—drawing accurate city road, yamen, granary, gate, and key facility maps. Xiao Zishan, Guo Yi, and others—guided by Liu Gang—casually browsed streets, mainly investigating future commercial development models.

The group changed clothes—exiting Huifu Street—walking through several alleys—reaching the bustling market. Shops lined both sides—extremely prosperous. Merchants from all regions gathered: Nanjing, Beijing, various provinces, even foreign countries. Goods ranged from ancient bronzes to fashionable silks, embroideries, cloth, household items—plus Western-origin chiming clocks and curiosities. Shops were categorized by trade—each occupying a street section. After breakfast, all streets thronged. By *si* hour (9-11 AM), crowds became overwhelming. People buying, people gawking, people marveling, people watching other people—surging back and forth—laughter and chatter. Truly more impressive than any film or TV drama scene. Everyone stared spellbound—reflecting: in less than twenty years, amid Ming-Qing civil wars, how much of this southeastern metropolis's three centuries of accumulated wealth would go up in flames or be plundered away? How many of these living, working people would become bleached bones? Sighs arose.

The further they walked, the more crowded—busier commerce. Everyone didn't know what to look at. Liu Gang knew routes well—when passages were too congested, he'd guide them through side streets. Walking along, Yan Maoda spotted a large jewelry shop beside the street—signaling interest. Everyone was curious—entered to browse. The Cantonese proprietor was showing a customer a mirror—that pink plastic frame instantly reminded Xiao Zishan: wasn't this the Wenzhou mirror he'd bulk-purchased from wholesale markets? Now being sold in jewelry shops.

"This mirror must cost 150 *liang*? Can't you lower it?"

The merchant answered extremely respectfully: "Truly cannot. Even at Gao's shop, you won't find such Crystal Dawn Jade mirrors now. If you want ordinary Black Jade mirrors—just 100 *liang*. Frankly: when more Crystal Color Jade mirrors will arrive—even Master Gao doesn't know! Such rare pink ones—in ten to fifteen days, they'll probably cost 200 *liang*."

Clearly, Gao wasn't just retailing—also wholesaling. Smart: as long as Australian merchants kept supplying, controlling wholesale distribution covered far more territory than just selling from his own shop. Per-unit profit decreased—but total sales volume increased.

The customer examined the mirror again: "Fine—I'll take it. This mirror is truly remarkable—reflects so clearly!"
