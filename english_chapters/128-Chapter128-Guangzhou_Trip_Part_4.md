# Chapter 128: Guangzhou Trip (Part 4)

The future blueprint Xiao Zishan drew up for the Qiwei Escort Bureau was essentially to restructure it into an armed freight company. The late-Ming social order was already crumbling, and long-distance transport was impossible without armed escorts.

Sun Kecheng was dumbfounded. Such grand claims—businesses extending everywhere, with bureau routes following! He didn't have that many martial brothers and disciples. Even with the ubiquitous forces of officials, bandits, and local tyrants, he couldn't possibly cultivate relationships with all three.

"No problem." Xiao Zishan wasn't concerned. "For now, just open one new route—Guangzhou to Haikang and Xuwen."

"Haikang, Xuwen?" Sun Kecheng was puzzled. Haikang was Leizhou Prefecture's seat, while Xuwen was a subordinate county. Both were remote backwaters in Guangdong. The main products were salt and sugar, and there were few wealthy households. The Australian merchants sold precious rarities—doing business in Leizhou would mean losing money.

"Correct." Xiao Zishan nodded. Opening this route served two purposes: first, establishing land connections between Hainan and Guangzhou. Bopu Port faced Xuwen's Denglong Point directly across the water. If sea routes were blocked, the transmigrators could cross from Bopu and travel overland via Leizhou to Guangzhou. Second, it would allow them to obtain local sugar. The Leizhou Peninsula's climate and soil were ideal for sugarcane. Since the Han Dynasty, sugar mills had existed there. By the Ming Dynasty, local cultivation and sugar production were highly developed. Around 1700, the annual output of crude sugar reached 10,000 tons—mostly exported. Sugar was among Ming-Qing China's most profitable overseas trade goods, and the transmigrators couldn't ignore it. Though they were currently unable to directly control the Leizhou Peninsula, establishing purchasing stations and securing supplies was still feasible.

What Xiao Zishan wanted from the Qiwei Bureau was to open branch offices in both Haikang and Xuwen within one month. Subsequently, they would establish mule and horse inns or cart services at key villages along the routes—forming relay-style transport lines. All funds for the branch office establishment would be provided by the transmigrators. Additionally, 3,000 *liang* would be given to Qiwei for recruiting personnel, cultivating local officials, and covering miscellaneous expenses.

"One month is too tight." Sun Kecheng shook his head repeatedly. "Qiwei has no routes in Leizhou—we need scouts to blaze trails. Front to back, this takes two to three months."

"Two months then. This is urgent." Wu Nanhai had informed him that the sugarcane harvest was from autumn through winter. If routes could be opened in time, they could establish purchasing stations in Leizhou for this season, and by next spring, they'd be mass exporting white sugar. The transmigrators' export commodities would be secured.

"That's manageable." Sun Kecheng, however, didn't seem particularly excited. "Forgive my bluntness: you gentlemen come from afar. Leizhou is remote wilderness. Doing business there—please reconsider..."

Xiao Zishan was touched. In another timeline, countless people devised clever schemes to defraud funding—polishing others' work as their own and easily bilking billions in taxpayer money. This struggling bureau chief was urging him to "reconsider" his investment! Human character really varied enormously.

"No worries—we have our reasons." Xiao Zishan knew that without legitimate reasons, these upstanding bureau people couldn't be won over with money alone. Fortunately, sugar buying was a ready-made excuse. "Leizhou produces sugar. The Australians desperately need sugarcane products. One round trip doubles the capital. We want to establish purchasing stations in Leizhou."

Sun Kecheng suddenly understood, repeatedly praised their "foresight," and readily agreed. Xiao Zishan then made three requests: first, quickly recruit personnel and expand the bureau ranks; second, help locate reliable local shop managers and clerks for opening businesses; and third, establish a regular contact system. Gao Di's martial arts training at the bureau made him suitable for this. They agreed that Huifu Street and the Bureau would communicate every seven days. Emergencies could be handled the same day. With arrangements settled, Xiao Zishan handed over bank drafts from Gao Ju. The partnership was thereby established.

Over the following days, Xiao Zishan shuttled between the Qiwei Bureau and the Gao mansion. He needed the locals' help for countless matters. He also witnessed Gao Ju's enormous influence as a Guangzhou merchant. Many issues required only the sending of a steward with his calling card, and it was done. It was more convenient than modern leaders' handwritten notes or phone calls.

Quickly, Guo Yi and the others' *baojia* (neighborhood registration) was completed, formally registering their residency. Actually, household registries and records were already defunct in late-Ming Guangzhou. *Baojia* was mainly a security measure. As for their origins, naturally, they couldn't claim to be Australian merchants. They were listed as townsmen of the Gao family. With Gao family stewards intervening, the semi-official local wardens dared not delay and immediately processed everything. Xiao Zishan knew these "minor officials"—whether past or present—were the trickiest. At critical moments, they could poison situations. He immediately produced a generous five *liang* tip packet. The recipient beamed, becoming ever more deferential.

The procurement delegation members—except for a few who stayed to guard the ship—moved into the Huifu Street mansion. After two days' rest, everyone clamored to go sightseeing to see what this 17th-century southeastern metropolis looked like.

Xiao Zishan knew blocking them would only cause resentment, but letting them swarm out uncontrolled would definitely cause trouble. These people were too well-nourished, and their behavior didn't match their surroundings. He divided them into five or six-person groups, each accompanied by two Qiwei escorts for safety. Each person received one *liang* of silver and 1,000 copper coins as pocket money.

Escorts, due to their connections in both the underworld and the legitimate world, had evolved a unique guarantee system. When underworld figures who'd "made friends" with bureaus entered cities for medical treatment, sightseeing, or shopping, bureaus would customarily send escorts to accompany them—providing good food, drink, and entertainment—then politely escort them out. There was one condition: city visitors couldn't cause trouble. No crimes; not even visiting brothels or gambling houses, or the escorts wouldn't accompany them. Underworld friends followed this rule. Over time, urban constables and investigators seeing outlaws with escorts customarily didn't question or search them. Xiao Zishan knew the transmigrators were too conspicuous. Groups roaming would immediately attract yamen investigators. Escort accompaniment was more prudent.

Everyone excitedly departed. Bei Wei took several trainees—also accompanied by escorts—but not for sightseeing. They were surveying Guangzhou's terrain, drawing accurate maps of city roads, yamens, granaries, gates, and key facilities. Xiao Zishan, Guo Yi, and others—guided by Liu Gang—casually browsed the streets, mainly investigating future commercial development models.

The group changed clothes, exited Huifu Street, walked through several alleys, and reached the bustling market. Shops lined both sides, and it was extremely prosperous. Merchants from all regions gathered: Nanjing, Beijing, various provinces, and even foreign countries. Goods ranged from ancient bronzes to fashionable silks, embroideries, cloth, and household items—plus Western-origin chiming clocks and curiosities. Shops were categorized by trade, each occupying a street section. After breakfast, all the streets thronged. By the *si* hour (9-11 AM), crowds became overwhelming. There were people buying, people gawking, people marveling, and people watching other people—surging back and forth with laughter and chatter. It was truly more impressive than any film or TV drama scene. Everyone stared spellbound, reflecting: in less than twenty years, amid the Ming-Qing civil wars, how much of this southeastern metropolis's three centuries of accumulated wealth would go up in flames or be plundered away? How many of these living, working people would become bleached bones? Sighs arose.

The further they walked, the more crowded it became, and the commerce was busier. Everyone didn't know where to look. Liu Gang knew the routes well—when passages were too congested, he'd guide them through side streets. Walking along, Yan Maoda spotted a large jewelry shop beside the street, signaling his interest. Everyone was curious and entered to browse. The Cantonese proprietor was showing a customer a mirror—that pink plastic frame instantly reminded Xiao Zishan: wasn't this the Wenzhou mirror he'd bulk purchased from wholesale markets? Now it was being sold in jewelry shops.

"This mirror must cost 150 *liang*? Can't you lower it?"

The merchant answered extremely respectfully. "Truly cannot. Even at Gao's shop, you won't find such Crystal Dawn Jade mirrors now. If you want ordinary Black Jade mirrors, they are just 100 *liang*. Frankly, even Master Gao doesn't know when more Crystal Color Jade mirrors will arrive! Such rare pink ones—in ten to fifteen days, they'll probably cost 200 *liang*."

Clearly, Gao wasn't just retailing; he was also wholesaling. Smart: as long as Australian merchants kept supplying, controlling wholesale distribution covered far more territory than just selling from his own shop. Per-unit profit decreased, but the total sales volume increased.

The customer examined the mirror again. "Fine—I'll take it. This mirror is truly remarkable—reflects so clearly!"
