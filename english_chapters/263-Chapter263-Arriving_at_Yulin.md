# Chapter 263 Arriving at Yulin

"This is Dadonghai," Captain Lin Chuanqing said, steadying the helm. "Which is the outer harbor of Yulin. Further inside, the long bag-shaped anchorage is the inner harbor."

The entire Yulin Harbor was embraced by surrounding mountains—emerald sea, white sand, blue sky, and coconut groves. The scenery was exceedingly beautiful and completely pristine in its ecological state.

"Yazhou is the main coconut production area of Hainan. We can make a big profit here!" Wang Luobin gazed at the patches of coconut trees dancing in the bay, visualizing countless products flying before his eyes, from harmless soap to nitroglycerin ready to tear people to pieces at any moment.

"Engineer Wang, I feel like you're comparable to the Japanese devils entering a village right now." Lin Chuanqing chuckled a few times and picked up the walkie-talkie to call:

"Little Mont, check the tide table. Is it low tide or high tide now?"

"It's starting to ebb!" Mont reported. "One hour and seventeen minutes until the lowest tide level."

"Commander Chen, Engineer Wang, let's drop anchor for now," Lin Chuanqing said. "It's better to enter the port at the lowest tide. There are several submerged reefs and low sandbars here that are visible at low tide."

"Alright, let's wait a while then." Chen Haiyang said, ordering the *Zhenhai* and *Hangzhou* via walkie-talkie to drop anchor and wait for the tide to lower further. "All naval cadets go measure water depth, wind direction, and wind speed. They will be in charge of piloting the ship into the port later!"

"Let these little brats pilot the ship?" Lin Chuanqing questioned.

"Yulin Harbor's hydrological conditions and reef situation are the simplest. It's good to let them practice." Chen Haiyang said, "Now that we have time, let's discuss what we plan to do after landing."

"Same things as in Changhua: establish a stronghold and survey resources." Wang Luobin was confident. "This place is our main source of copra. To break the Qiongshan merchants' monopoly on copra, we must establish a direct trading post here."

"We need to send someone to Yazhou City to sound out the situation."

"Yazhou probably won't be as smooth as Changhua. This is an important ruling stronghold of the government in the southern part of Hainan Island." Wang Luobin didn't seem very confident.

The registered population of Yazhou was nearly twenty thousand, comparable to Lingao County. Since the Tang Dynasty, this had been a place of exile for officials. There was a Shuinan Village outside Yazhou City, which had always been a place where exiled officials settled. Therefore, not only were there many gentry families here, but they were also deeply rooted; some had propagated locally for over twenty generations. Opening up a situation here would likely require some brainpower.

"I think it shouldn't be a big problem," Chen Haiyang spread out the map. "According to the Intelligence Department's data, most of Yazhou's population is concentrated near Yazhou City, which is the government's ruling core. Yazhou City is here—" he pointed at the map, "which is the Yazhou Bay area we passed yesterday. By land to Yulin, the straight-line distance is over 60 kilometers. This area is practically uninhabited. Establishing a stronghold here won't attract much interference."

"What about the Ming army's patrol ships?" Wang Luobin asked. He remembered from history books that the Ming army had garrisons patrolling nearby.

"It's not like we're building a castle and grandly hoisting a big flag," Chen Haiyang said. "We'll build a small fort or stockade—these things are everywhere in this spacetime. Then assign a few indigenous people specifically to deal with inquiries. The Ming army has no reason to deal with us. If a fight really breaks out, a few patrol ships can't open up our fortress. If they gather a large force, we can use our communication advantage to mobilize superior forces and wipe out their main force in one stroke."

While they were discussing the work after landing, Mont shouted from over there, "Ten minutes until the lowest tide level."

"Enter the port."

This time entering the port, they didn't lower the outboard motors but lowered the rowboats to tow the large ships in with manpower. All piloting and observation work was performed by the naval cadets.

At this time, the tide in the bay had dropped to its lowest. Submerged reefs and sandbars were exposed above the water. From the poop deck, one could see without a telescope the exposed reefs not far from Shen Island. To the northwest of Shen Island, a line of underwater reefs almost a full cable length long was revealed.

The fleet sailed all the way to the entrance of Yulin's inner harbor. The entire inner harbor was shaped like a long pocket, surrounded by mountains on three sides, with the outer harbor as a buffer water area and Shen Island as a shield in front. The port area inside was open, with water deep enough to anchor ten-thousand-ton ships. The hydrological conditions were extremely superior.

So superior that even the home-guard navy admirals who had basically never been to sea in the past could see that this was a suitable naval base. At this moment, they were all chattering in discussion:

"This place would make an excellent naval base."

"The Ironclad Fleet will cruise Southeast Asia from here, patrolling our ten thousand miles of territorial seas—"

"Why do you need an Ironclad Fleet for Southeast Asia? Little colonial cruisers are enough!"

"Right, the colonial cruiser in my mind must be: mixed sail and steam power, unarmored, long range, with at least one large-caliber gun for shore bombardment to deal with disobedient natives. By the way, the cabin space must be large too, able to carry at least one company of marines and necessary cannons, ready to go ashore to suppress riots at any time."

...

The rowboats measured the depth while advancing towards the inner harbor.

"Over there is Yulin Market." Ming Qiu pointed to a vacant lot on the west side of the inner harbor. On the east side of the inner harbor, there was a market town protected by a relatively large wooden stockade. According to Ming Qiu's memory, this should be Anyoule Market. Judging by the scale, there were about a hundred households. Some ships of various sizes were also anchored by the shore.

"Let's dock on the east side; there are people there, and we can ask for information."

So the fleet dropped anchor below Anyoule Market. Seeing two large ships arrive, the people active around the stockade all poured into the stockade at once. Before their small boats could approach the shore, the vicinity of Anyoule Market was empty.

"It looks like pirates visit this place often."

Everyone disembarked and walked all the way to the front of the stockade. Wang Luobin asked the indigenous interpreter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs who accompanied them to shout. After talking back and forth for a long time, the people in Anyoule Market finally opened the stockade gate to let them in. This place was a large stockade where Han and Li people lived together. Because ships sailing to the South Seas often took shelter here on weekdays, and occasionally drifted cargo from shipwrecks could be salvaged, people had settled here since the Tang Dynasty. Because this was the last anchorage before ships went to the South Seas, the wealth and demand brought by ships slowly formed a market town over time.

The person in power in Anyoule Market was a member of the gentry named Hu Xun. After the transmigrators presented their tried-and-true gifts: small mirrors, white sugar, and distilled spirits, his attitude immediately softened a lot. According to Hu Xun, he was a descendant of the Hu family of Shuinan Village in Yazhou.

"Could it be that the old gentleman is a descendant of Mister Dan'an? Disrespect! Disrespect!" Wang Tao, who accompanied Wang Luobin ashore, feigned surprise and cupped his hands. Because he told storytelling as a hobby, he had a talent for learning dialects and had learned several commonly used local dialects. Hu Xun spoke the local Mandarin—Hainan dialect, which was considered the easiest to understand.

Hu Xun was very pleased with this, repeatedly saying "disgracing the ancestors," and his attitude towards everyone improved a few more notches. He then asked what business they had here.

Wang Tao then followed the pre-arranged script, saying they were merchants specializing in South Seas trade. Because the journey was full of risks and obstacles, they wanted to buy a piece of land here to build a few warehouses and a manor to store goods and rest.

Hu Xun repeatedly said, "Easy to discuss, easy to discuss." There wasn't much here, but there was plenty of wasteland. If someone was willing to build a house, he, the local Baojia head, would naturally gain another source of income. Although these people didn't look like kind folks—especially those two big ships, which were obviously prohibited—as long as they didn't rob or kill, what illegal business they did was none of his concern. These local tycoons had all practiced the skill of being chameleons.

After leaving, Mont asked Wang Tao, "Who is Mister Dan'an?"

"Mister Dan'an is the famous Hu Quan," Seeing Mont's confused look, Wang Tao had to explain further, "He was exiled to Hainan back then for impeaching Qin Hui."

"Such a figure." Mont was filled with reverence.

Wang Luobin laughed, "You were flattering him too. Hu Quan didn't die in Hainan; he eventually went back to his hometown in Jiangxi. How could he leave descendants here?"

"He calls himself Hu of Shuinan Village, obviously intending to imply he's Hu Quan's descendant. I took the opportunity to flatter him; it doesn't cost me anything."

The group walked around the streets of Anyoule Market. The place was quite prosperous. Although there was only one street less than 500 meters long, various shops lined both sides. Because this was the last place to rest before going to the South Seas, many ships stayed here for a long time either to shelter from the wind or wait for the monsoon. Over time, all kinds of entertainment became available, and there was even a brothel.

Wang Luobin noticed that there were many blacksmith shops here. Upon inquiry, the consumers were mainly nearby Li people, as well as ships anchored here—they used them when repairing ships.

Wang Tao said, "It seems Tiandu Iron Mine has already been discovered."

"Tiandu Iron Mine itself shouldn't have been discovered, but Yazhou has been famous for producing iron since ancient times," Wang Luobin said.

Ming Qiu said, "In the past when I went to Yazhou Town, there was a Blacksmith Street there, full of blacksmith shops. It's said the earliest ones came in the Southern Song Dynasty."

"It seems there are quite a few scattered iron ore deposits here." Wang Tao went to ask the blacksmiths where their pig iron came from, and the answer was that it was all transported from Yazhou.

"That's good." Wang Luobin said, "If the local natives were already mining at Tiandu, we'd inevitably have to engage in some violent demolition."

"Even if they aren't, it probably won't be easy, right? I remember the government has always been opposed to mining, banning it forever at the drop of a hat."

"But they can never ban it effectively, can they?"

Over the next few days, the transmigrators rowed boats to survey the coastal terrain around Yulin Harbor and corrected the maps. They also conducted on-site surveys for the site selection of Yulin Fort, finally choosing a vacant lot on the west bank of Yulin Harbor. This place was the location of the later Yulin Base: sheltered from the wind, having fresh water, and flat terrain.
