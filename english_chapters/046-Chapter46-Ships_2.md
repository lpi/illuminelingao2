Chapter 46 Ships (2)

Buying ships was only an expedient measure. To truly control the ocean, one must be able to build ships oneself.

So, the construction of Bopu Shipyard was put on the agenda.

The site of the shipyard was chosen in a bay on the east side of Bopu Harbor. The water was deep and the wind was calm, suitable for shipbuilding.

However, building a shipyard is not building a house. It requires professional technology and equipment.

"We need a dry dock." Li Di drew on the drawing, "Only in a dry dock can we build large ships and repair the bottom of ships."

"But digging a dry dock is a huge project." Wang Luobin frowned, "With our current manpower and machinery, it will take at least a year to dig it."

"We can't wait that long." Wen Desi said, "We must find a shortcut."

"How about a floating dock?" Someone suggested.

"Floating dock?"

"Yes. Use a large barge or connect several ships together to form a floating platform. Build ships on it, then sink the platform to let the ship enter the water."

"This idea is good!" Wang Luobin's eyes lit up, "But we don't have such a big barge."

"We can build one." Li Di said, "Use wood. Or concrete."

"Concrete?"

"Yes. Concrete ships." Li Di explained, "During World War I and World War II, due to the shortage of steel, many countries built concrete ships. Although they are heavy and brittle, they are cheap and easy to build, suitable for barges and docks."

"Just do it!"

So, the Transmigrators began to build concrete floating docks.

They weaved huge steel meshes with steel bars on the beach, then poured concrete.

A few weeks later, a huge concrete floating dock appeared on the sea surface.

"It floats! It really floats!" Everyone cheered.

With the floating dock, the construction of the shipyard accelerated significantly.

They built slipways, gantry cranes, timber processing workshops...

A modern shipyard began to take shape.

At the same time, they also began to recruit shipwrights.

Through high salaries and good treatment, they attracted many skilled shipwrights from Guangzhou, Fujian and other places.

These shipwrights had built traditional wooden ships all their life. When they saw the "strange ships" (such as concrete ships, iron-clad ships) designed by the Transmigrators, they were all dumbfounded.

"Master, can this ship float?" An old shipwright asked, knocking on the concrete hull.

"Don't worry, it absolutely floats." Li Di smiled, "This is called science."

Under the guidance of the Transmigrators, the shipwrights began to learn new shipbuilding techniques.

They learned to read drawings, use modern tools, and process new materials.

Slowly, they accepted these new things and burst out with amazing creativity.

They combined traditional skills with modern technology to create a batch of unique new ships.

For example, the "Lingao Type Galley". It retained the oars and sails of the galley ship, but adopted a streamlined hull design and installed a steam auxiliary power system. It was fast and flexible, a sharp weapon for coastal patrol.

Another example is the "Bopu Type Transport Ship". It adopted a wide flat-bottom design with a large cargo capacity and shallow draft, capable of sailing in inland rivers.

With the launch of these ships, the maritime transport capacity of the Transmigrators was greatly improved.

They could transport materials from the mainland and Southeast Asia more quickly and project power to farther places.

The Bopu Shipyard became the cradle of the Transmigrators' maritime hegemony.
