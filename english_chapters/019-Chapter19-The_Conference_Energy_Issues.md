# Chapter 19: The Conference — Energy Issues

"Let's start with energy." Xiao Zishan turned toward the Energy Group. "Energy is the key to everything. As long as we have electricity, we can use any tool from modern machinery to computers—advantages that completely surpass the ancients. What does the Energy Group have to say about our power supply?"

The speaker who rose from the Energy Group was Chang Kaishen. As a temp worker, he had been employed at a subsidiary of a certain power corporation for five years—the type who did the most work, got the lowest pay, received no credit, and took all the blame.

"Given the situation we'll face, a strategy of hydropower as the main source, supplemented by thermal and wind power, is most suitable.

"The benefits of hydropower are many—I won't elaborate here. For our team, the greatest advantage is that it doesn't require fuel replenishment; once built, it can operate almost indefinitely.

"Currently, small rural hydropower equipment is quite simple—low installation difficulty, minimal engineering investment. Power is generated via diversion channels; a head of 5–6 meters is sufficient. This technology is very mature. Small and micro units are now manufactured in standardized series domestically; they're easy to maintain and inexpensive.

"At the same time, we'll need thermal power. Thermal prime movers can use various methods. Diesel generators are convenient, require no infrastructure, and aren't limited by environment—they'll be our main power source in the early landing phase."

Someone raised a hand: "Diesel will run out eventually. What then?"

"Diesel engines can use substitutes relatively easily—I recall you can use peanut oil," someone from the Energy Group said.

"Heh, I don't know about peanut oil, but diesel engines can be converted to run on producer gas." Chang Kaishen thought for a moment. "When I was in the countryside, I saw many small power stations using gas engines. It shouldn't be difficult."

"I believe we'll eventually be able to produce diesel." Xiao Zishan said. "Continue."

"All right," he went on. "Based on not putting all our eggs in one basket, we need small-to-medium diesel generators, small hydro, and small wind turbines. We should also bring some medium-capacity hydro units for future expansion once we have sufficient engineering capability. As for wind turbines—though they have issues of low output and unstable generation—they're simple to set up and suitable as backup power for living areas, independent outposts, and system redundancy."

He smiled. "Of course, power isn't that simple—there are issues of transmission, distribution, and voltage transformation, all quite technical. I won't go into detail. A concrete plan will take considerable time to develop."

The next topic was also for the Energy Group: substitutes for petroleum products. The transmigrators needed more than just generators; they also needed motorcycles, cars, and small boats. Neither gasoline nor diesel could be stored long-term. Without fuel self-sufficiency, there was no point bringing too many such vehicles.

"Heh, I can't agree with the moderator's comment," said the next speaker from the Energy Group—Luo Duo, who had posted enormous amounts of energy-related content during the online discussions. "Though I'm told the moderator is a humanities major, so it's understandable."

Xiao Zishan's face flushed. His greatest grievance was "humanities major" being used as an insult. He suppressed his indignation and feigned composure.

"Actually, what we're discussing is a prime-mover problem," said Luo Duo, apparently oblivious to the moderator's resentment. "Ships, cars, motorcycles—all can be driven by non-petroleum fuels. So petroleum substitutes aren't an urgent issue.

"Basically, any petroleum-fueled prime mover can be converted to run on producer gas, though with some power loss. But near the end of World War II, the Germans experimentally installed gas generators on armored personnel carriers and tanks, so the power output is still acceptable. Gas-generator technology is very simple and practical, with low implementation difficulty.

"Also, let's not forget the steam engine. How long have gasoline and diesel engines been around? The steam engine was the engine of the Industrial Revolution."

"Is there anywhere to buy steam engines nowadays? Don't tell me you expect us to make them." Someone from the Machinery Group spoke up.

"You machinists—making a steam engine shouldn't be hard, right? That's nineteenth-century technology!" Luo Duo retorted. "Our prime movers can't run on stockpiles forever. Someday they'll be exhausted."

"We've never actually built a steam engine," the Machinery Group huddled briefly. Ma Qianzhu stood up. "Everyone understands the principle; there's plenty of existing design material. We're confident we can build one. The boiler is the main difficulty—it depends on what materials we can achieve. That's up to the Metallurgy Department."

"Currently, Metallurgy falls under the Industry Group," Xiao Zishan clarified. "I recall we have specialists in that area."

"That's right—we have a college student majoring in metallurgy." Several people burst out laughing; a young man smiled sheepishly.

"Coordinate within your group and come up with a plan. Please continue."

"That's all I can think of for now." Luo Duo looked excited but showed signs of fatigue.

"Why not consider biodiesel?" someone asked. "There's been a lot of coverage lately; many countries have reached the practical stage."

"Right—I recall Hainan has a kind of kerosene tree. Cut the bark and the sap that flows out can be used as lamp oil."

"It can only be used for lamps; it's not real kerosene." Ma Qianzhu held forth authoritatively. "Biodiesel is not a simple technology. Though there are many oil-bearing crops—oil camellia, tung trees, Pistacia chinensis, bamboo tung, and so on—none of the oils they produce can be used directly as diesel. They require a series of modification processes. Besides, whether it's kerosene trees or other oil plants, having just a few trees or a small grove is useless. Typically, such plantations need at least a hundred *mu* to form an effective supply."

"By the way, I should point out that oil-nan trees must grow to 40–50 centimeters in trunk diameter before they produce oil. Based on current findings, in Hainan they only grow in Sanya, Ledong, Dongfang, Changjiang, and Baisha—areas with better water-temperature conditions than Lingao or Danzhou." Someone from the Agriculture Group spoke up.

"We could distill pine-root oil. The Japanese did this in World War II—you don't need special equipment to refine aviation gasoline."

"True, but the cost-effectiveness is terrible. The Japanese mobilized practically the entire population and produced only a few tens of thousands of barrels. Besides, Hainan doesn't have that many pine roots for us to dig."

"What about alcohol?" The biofuel faction persisted.

"It can substitute, but alcohol has too low a heat value and causes engine carbon buildup—not an ideal substitute."

"I have one more perspective on petroleum substitutes." Another person stood up. "I'm Zhong Lishi. I work in oil-shale retorting equipment design. I once designed oil-shale refining equipment for an oil plant in Danzhou City, Hainan.

"That city has abundant oil-shale reserves. Products from oil-shale retorting can be further refined into various petroleum products. From this perspective, manufacturing gasoline and diesel is no problem."

"Where's Danzhou?" someone muttered.

"Just west of Lingao. Very close."

"That resource sounds quite good."

"Let me give a brief introduction: Changpo oil shale has a 5.1% oil content and is associated with lignite. The Changpo deposit has two main ore bodies, 6 meters and 44.5 meters thick respectively. Mining is primarily open-pit.

"We can use Maoming-type retorts for processing. Capacity is 50 tons of ore per retort per day, with 60% oil recovery. At Changpo's 5.1% oil content, each retort yields 1.5 tons of crude oil daily—not including by-products like gasoline and ammonia.

"These retorts don't require many resources or much labor to build. To commission a small plant processing 1,600 tons per day—that is, 32 retorts—we'd also need 2 gas-heating furnaces, 1 ventilation building, 2 scrubbing towers, 2 cooling towers, and 2 chimneys. I have ready-made design drawings for all of this; the equipment isn't difficult to manufacture. Such a plant would produce 48 tons of crude oil per day, plus by-products like gasoline, ammonia, coal gas, and phenol—all very useful.

"Oil-shale crude is high quality; it can be refined into premium diesel. So I believe diesel and gasoline engines can both operate normally—no need for gas engines."

"Processing 1,600 tons daily!" Luo Duo jumped up. "Even if we all carried rocks, it wouldn't be enough!"

"For an oil-shale plant, that's already quite small." Zhong Lishi wore the inscrutable smile of a high-level intellectual. "In reality, transport is by train and conveyor belt. The design output I mentioned is less than a single unit at a real shale-oil plant. The plant I work with has several refining units even more capable—each retort processes 200 tons.

"If you think Changpo's oil yield is too low, the oil shale in Huangxian and Penglai, Shandong has the best quality—22% oil content. If we don't have petroleum-extraction capability within ten or twenty years, we might consider taking Shandong first."

The crowd began murmuring among themselves. Several people from the Athletics Group were poring over a map of China.

"Let's have the Energy Group include this as a long-term plan, depending on what level our manufacturing reaches." Wen Desi spoke. "Let's continue." He glanced at Xiao Zishan, who nodded.
