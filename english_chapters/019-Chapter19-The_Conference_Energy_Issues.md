# Chapter 19: The Conference — Energy Issues

"Let's start with energy." Xiao Zishan turned toward the Energy Group. "Energy is key to everything. As long as we have electricity, we can use tools from modern machinery to computers—advantages that completely surpass the ancients. What does Energy have to say about power supply?"

The speaker from the Energy Group was Chang Kaishen. As a temp worker, he had been employed at a power corporation subsidiary for five years—the type who did the most work, got the lowest pay, received no credit, and took all the blame.

"Given our situation, a strategy of hydropower as the main source, supplemented by thermal and wind, is most suitable.

"The benefits of hydropower are many—I won't elaborate. For our team, the greatest advantage is that it doesn't require fuel replenishment; once built, it operates almost indefinitely.

"Currently, small rural hydropower equipment is quite simple—low installation difficulty, minimal engineering investment. Power is generated via diversion channels; a head of 5–6 meters is sufficient. This technology is mature. Small and micro units are manufactured in standardized domestic series; they're easy to maintain and inexpensive.

"At the same time, we'll need thermal power. Thermal prime movers can use various methods. Diesel generators are convenient, require no infrastructure, and aren't limited by environment—they'll be our main power source in the early landing phase."

Someone raised a hand: "Diesel will run out eventually. What then?"

"Diesel engines can use substitutes relatively easily—I recall you can use peanut oil," someone from the Energy Group said.

"Heh, I don't know about peanut oil, but diesel engines can convert to producer gas." Chang Kaishen thought. "When I was in the countryside, I saw many small power stations using gas engines. Shouldn't be difficult."

"I believe we'll eventually produce diesel." Xiao Zishan said. "Continue."

"All right," he went on. "Based on not putting all eggs in one basket, we need small-to-medium diesel generators, small hydro, and small wind turbines. We should also bring medium-capacity hydro units for future expansion once we have sufficient engineering capability. As for wind turbines—though they have low output and unstable generation—they're simple to set up and suitable as backup for living areas, outposts, and system redundancy."

He smiled. "Of course, power isn't that simple—transmission, distribution, voltage transformation are all quite technical. I won't go into detail. A concrete plan will take time."

The next topic was also for Energy: substitutes for petroleum products. The transmigrators needed more than generators; they needed motorcycles, cars, and small boats. Neither gasoline nor diesel could be stored long-term. Without fuel self-sufficiency, there was no point bringing many such vehicles.

"Heh, I can't agree with the moderator's comment," said Luo Duo, who had posted enormous amounts of energy content during online discussions. "Though I'm told the moderator is a humanities major, so it's understandable."

Xiao Zishan's face flushed. His greatest grievance was "humanities major" being used as an insult. He suppressed his indignation and feigned composure.

"Actually, what we're discussing is a prime-mover problem," said Luo Duo, apparently oblivious to the moderator's resentment. "Ships, cars, motorcycles—all can run on non-petroleum fuels. So petroleum substitutes aren't urgent.

"Basically, any petroleum-fueled prime mover can convert to producer gas, though with some power loss. But near the end of World War II, the Germans experimentally installed gas generators on armored personnel carriers and tanks, so the output is acceptable. Gas-generator technology is simple, practical, with low implementation difficulty.

"Also, let's not forget the steam engine. How long have gasoline and diesel engines been around? The steam engine was the engine of the Industrial Revolution."

"Is there anywhere to buy steam engines nowadays? Don't tell me you expect us to make them." Someone from Machinery spoke up.

"You machinists—making a steam engine shouldn't be hard, right? That's nineteenth-century technology!" Luo Duo retorted. "Our prime movers can't run on stockpiles forever."

"We've never actually built one," the Machinery Group huddled briefly. Ma Qianzhu stood. "Everyone understands the principle; there's plenty of design material. We're confident we can build one. The boiler is the main difficulty—depends on what materials we can achieve. That's up to Metallurgy."

"Currently, Metallurgy falls under Industry," Xiao Zishan clarified. "I recall we have specialists."

"That's right—we have a college student majoring in metallurgy." Several people laughed; a young man smiled sheepishly.

"Coordinate within your group and come up with a plan. Please continue."

"That's all I can think of." Luo Duo looked excited but showed signs of fatigue.

"Why not consider biodiesel?" someone asked. "There's been a lot of coverage; many countries have reached the practical stage."

"Right—I recall Hainan has a kind of kerosene tree. Cut the bark and the sap can be used as lamp oil."

"It can only be used for lamps; it's not real kerosene." Ma Qianzhu held forth authoritatively. "Biodiesel is not simple. Though there are many oil-bearing crops—oil camellia, tung trees, Pistacia chinensis, bamboo tung—none of the oils can be used directly as diesel. They require modification processes. Besides, having just a few trees is useless. Such plantations need at least a hundred *mu* to form effective supply."

"By the way, oil-nan trees must grow to 40–50 centimeters in trunk diameter before producing oil. Based on current findings, in Hainan they only grow in Sanya, Ledong, Dongfang, Changjiang, and Baisha—areas with better conditions than Lingao or Danzhou." Someone from Agriculture spoke up.

"We could distill pine-root oil. The Japanese did this in World War II—you don't need special equipment to refine aviation gasoline."

"True, but the cost-effectiveness is terrible. The Japanese mobilized practically the entire population and produced only tens of thousands of barrels. Besides, Hainan doesn't have that many pine roots."

"What about alcohol?" The biofuel faction persisted.

"It can substitute, but alcohol has too low a heat value and causes engine carbon buildup—not an ideal substitute."

"I have one more perspective on petroleum substitutes." Another person stood. "I'm Zhong Lishi. I work in oil-shale retorting equipment design. I once designed refining equipment for a plant in Danzhou City, Hainan.

"That city has abundant oil-shale reserves. Products from oil-shale retorting can be further refined into various petroleum products. Manufacturing gasoline and diesel is no problem."

"Where's Danzhou?" someone muttered.

"Just west of Lingao. Very close."

"That resource sounds quite good."

"Let me give a brief introduction: Changpo oil shale has 5.1% oil content and is associated with lignite. The Changpo deposit has two main ore bodies, 6 meters and 44.5 meters thick respectively. Mining is primarily open-pit.

"We can use Maoming-type retorts. Capacity is 50 tons of ore per retort per day, with 60% oil recovery. At Changpo's 5.1% content, each retort yields 1.5 tons of crude daily—not including by-products like gasoline and ammonia.

"These retorts don't require many resources or much labor. To commission a small plant processing 1,600 tons per day—32 retorts—we'd also need 2 gas-heating furnaces, 1 ventilation building, 2 scrubbing towers, 2 cooling towers, and 2 chimneys. I have ready-made drawings; the equipment isn't difficult to manufacture. Such a plant would produce 48 tons of crude per day, plus by-products like gasoline, ammonia, coal gas, and phenol—all very useful.

"Oil-shale crude is high quality; it can be refined into premium diesel. So diesel and gasoline engines can both operate normally—no need for gas engines."

"Processing 1,600 tons daily!" Luo Duo jumped up. "Even if we all carried rocks, it wouldn't be enough!"

"For an oil-shale plant, that's already quite small." Zhong Lishi wore the inscrutable smile of a high-level intellectual. "In reality, transport is by train and conveyor belt. The design output I mentioned is less than a single unit at a real shale-oil plant.

"If you think Changpo's oil yield is too low, the oil shale in Huangxian and Penglai, Shandong has 22% oil content. If we don't have petroleum extraction within ten or twenty years, we might consider taking Shandong first."

The crowd began murmuring. Several people from Athletics were poring over a map of China.

"Let's have Energy include this as a long-term plan, depending on what manufacturing level we reach." Wen Desi spoke. "Let's continue." He glanced at Xiao Zishan, who nodded.
