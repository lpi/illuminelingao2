# Chapter 798 – Li Yongxun's Reconnaissance

Lin Ming rose in the morning and, served by two maids, took a comfortable petal bath, feeling refreshed. He changed clothes and slowly walked to the main hall—a moderate amount of pleasant sexual activity was beneficial to body and mind. Lin Ming was physically and mentally delighted at this moment. Seeing a full set of fine porcelain containing breakfast already laid out on the redwood round table, his mood became even more cheerful.

Li Yongxun, however, seemed preoccupied, not even finishing a bowl of high-quality raw fish porridge. Because his desires had been fully satisfied by the "great battle" last night, Lin Ming's "familial affection" for his sister-in-law had greatly increased today. He asked with concern:

"Does your foot still hurt?"

"It doesn't hurt." Li Yongxun had tossed and turned last night after returning to her room, unable to sleep: thinking about how to deal with the bald bandits. She had wanted to wake her brother-in-law up overnight to arrest them but feared his blame—she now knew a thing or two about men's foul tempers: "a moment of spring night is worth a thousand gold," and the consequences of interrupting her brother-in-law's spring night would be very severe.

"Brother-in-law," Li Yongxun stammered, "This Master Huang is secretly dealing with the bald bandits, isn't he?"

"Of course. If he wasn't, where did the things you ate yesterday come from?" Lin Ming said lightly.

"But the bald bandits are overseas barbarians usurping prefectures and counties... Lord Wang even campaigned against them..." Li Yongxun felt her brother-in-law wasn't very enthusiastic about catching bald bandits. "I saw them last night; there are bald bandits right in the Huang residence. Why not catch them and send them to Guangzhou? It would be a merit for you, brother-in-law..."

Lin Ming put down his porridge bowl and scolded in a low voice: "Catch them and send them to Guangzhou—to invite the bald thief navy to Guangzhou city walls again? A woman's short-sightedness!"

Although the bald thief navy retreated after invading Guangzhou, everyone from top to bottom knew this was the result of Governor Li "negotiating terms." It wasn't because the bald bandits were defeated or afraid of the Court. Why go provoke the tiger's whiskers for no reason when he had nothing to do?

Seeing his sister-in-law's face showing great displeasure, Lin Ming felt his words were too harsh. He explained patiently: "What's the use of catching bald bandits? If you want to catch one, Proprietor Guo, the big bald bandit boss, will soon return to Guangzhou openly and grandly—Governor Li will probably even send congratulatory gifts—who dares to catch bald bandits now?"

"But—" Li Yongxun's loyal heart to the Court and her desire for personal revenge intertwined, still wanting to make a last effort.

"The bald bandits haven't offended us; there's no need to make enemies with them—besides, if you catch him and send him to Guangzhou, they'll just release him anyway."

"No need to release him," Li Yongxun was eager to try. "Don't hand him to the yamen; take him back to the Battalion headquarters for private interrogation—I don't believe all bald bandits have iron teeth and bronze teeth. They'll confess their treasonous plots..."

Lin Ming drank his porridge slowly, letting her talk nonsense freely. Only when she finished did he say leisurely: "Eat your breakfast first. After the meal, I'll take you out for a walk."

Li Yongxun instantly felt discouraged, knowing her brother-in-law had no intention of dealing with the bald bandits. Filled with indignation, she simply refused to eat breakfast in a fit of pique. After the meal, she even refused when her brother-in-law offered to take her out.

"I don't feel well." Li Yongxun put on an attitude she thought was very cool. Lin Ming knew she was throwing a tantrum and simply ignored her. It happened that Huang Shunlong invited him to discuss matters, so he made a few perfunctory remarks and left.

Once Lin Ming left, Li Yongxun felt her patriotic enthusiasm was not only unsupported but also mocked by her brother-in-law. Depressed, she lay on the bed and cried—after crying for a while, hearing only silence around her, she felt crying was useless if no one heard or comforted her, so she stopped.

"Hmph, you won't catch them, I will! I, Li Yongxun, am a true loyalist of the Court!" Li Yongxun's stubborn streak surged. She changed back into men's clothing and hung her small-sized embroidered spring sword at her waist. Although she had returned the stolen Embroidered Uniform Guard badge to the pursuing family servants long ago, in Foshan, Lin Ming couldn't resist her demands and felt having a badge was safer, so he gave her the badge of a long-vacant Xiaowei (Guard) position in the Battalion. Li Yongxun hung the badge at her waist, one hand on her sword, the other on her hip, standing chest out in the center of the hall, suddenly feeling possessed by generations of Embroidered Uniform Guard commanders!

Li Yongxun abandoned the idea of getting information from the Huang family's maids and servants: since Huang Shunlong was doing shady business, his subordinates had likely been taught not to talk to outsiders—now she had no official status, unable to threaten or torture, so she could only investigate secretly. Her foot had healed; though she couldn't run, walking wasn't hindered. She quietly climbed over a low section of the courtyard wall in the backyard and slipped out.

She didn't know the way at all—fortunately, Macau was small. Huang Shunlong was a famous figure; if she got lost, she could just call a sedan chair to take her back. Li Yongxun wandered around the alleys after climbing the wall and soon learned from a chatty, bored clerk in a grocery store: last night, a sedan chair and seven or eight people had indeed entered the Huang residence through the back door. Several of them carried rattan chests on their backs, which looked heavy.

She also knew these people came from the direction of Seventh Lane. Li Yongxun went toward Seventh Lane, which was no different from the Fifth Lane she walked yesterday. When she noticed the same pointed roof she saw yesterday, she suddenly realized this group must have come from the pier direction—Fifth Lane and Seventh Lane should be parallel. And the Huang residence was actually not far from the pier.

Li Yongxun followed the alley slowly toward the pier. There were more pedestrians in this alley—occasionally small vendors, porters, and some barbaric-looking foreigners in strange clothes passed by: red-skinned, yellow-haired, blue-eyed Northern Europeans; light-brown-skinned, black-haired Latins; short, yellow-eyed Southeast Asian natives; short Japanese with messy hair shaved into semi-circles; dark-skinned Indians; and authentic African blacks, pitch-black all over with only the whites of their eyes showing... One could see a few of almost every kind here. The grotesque appearances made Li Yongxun feel very nervous—many terrifying stories about overseas barbarians circulated widely in Guangdong.

Fortunately, no one paid attention to her along the way. Li Yongxun observed her surroundings as she walked. She heard seagull calls not far away and smelled the salty scent of the sea in the wind, knowing she was nearing the seaside.

Sure enough, the end of the alley opened up; the residential area ended here. This was a large patch of compacted mud. Several wooden trestles extended into the bay, where many ships were moored. Masts stood like a forest—many were ships she had never seen before. Especially several large galleons, with huge hulls, masts towering into the clouds, and cannons shining in the gun ports... Li Yongxun, seeing European ships for the first time, was amazed. Ignoring the mud puddles big and small on the ground, she kept walking forward, wanting to get closer for a clear look.

Piles of goods lay on the ground, covered with reed mats. Teams of coolies, shouting chants, carried goods wrapped in straw bags and hemp sacks onto the ships in an endless stream. Some packaging was damaged, revealing straw ropes binding porcelain or coarse cloth wrapping silk.

Li Yongxun watched almost dumbfounded—where had she ever seen such a large-scale overseas trade scene? She had already forgotten most of her mission to track bald bandits. She just walked and looked around, wishing she could grow a few more pairs of eyes.

She felt curious about almost everything in front of her; even a broken small boat abandoned in the mud, wreckage of a ship destroyed by a storm, and a stone anchor deeply embedded in the mud aroused her interest. Walking and watching, she unknowingly reached the other side of the pier, ending at a silted-up dead-water bay where various garbage floated on the surface, emitting foul odors. Li Yongxun covered her nose and hurried back. She found a tea stall on the pier, ordered a pot of tea to rest her feet, and asked if there were ships from Lingao.

"Yes, yes." The tea stall owner was a middle-aged woman. Though called a tea stall, she mainly earned money for hot water—her customers were coolies on the pier who couldn't afford tea, only buying some "herbal tea" without tea leaves for one or two copper coins to replenish water. Selling a whole pot of tea today made her very enthusiastic.

"Lingao ships come every ten days or so. Three or four ships at a time." The middle-aged woman pointed to a ship not far away. "Isn't that their ship?"

Li Yongxun looked where she pointed: it was just an ordinary-looking two-masted large Guangdong ship, nothing special. It just looked tidier and cleaner than ordinary ships. She was a bit disappointed—she had long heard bald bandits had big iron ships and expected to see something different.

On the Lingao ship, a man stood at the bow and stern, looking around occasionally. Li Yongxun knew they were likely "lookouts"—it seemed they were very careful, probably up to some shady business.

"Is it transporting goods?"

"Of course it's transporting goods." The tea-selling auntie wiped the table and sat opposite Li Yongxun. Having no other customers at the moment, she was happy to chat. "Ship after ship of goods; coolies have to unload for half a day to finish. The goods are moved to the warehouse once unloaded—I hear they are all valuable items. Who doesn't know Lingao's Australian goods? I even want to buy one of their small mirror powder compacts! Pity it costs two taels of silver!"

"Where is the warehouse?"

"Right at the entrance of Fifth Lane." The tea-selling auntie said the warehouse was a house specially rented by Lingao people to store and transship goods. Traveling merchants and sailors also stayed there.

Li Yongxun's heart skipped a beat. She looked toward the alley entrance—and saw a group of people coming out of Fifth Lane. Seven or eight big men surrounded a two-bearer small sedan chair, walking hurriedly.

"Are these people from Lingao?" she asked.

"Probably," the tea-selling lady looked and nodded. "Look, there are a few with short hair in the group. Who else could they be if not bald people?"
