# Chapter 13: The New Society and the Old Society

Online discussions ranged from preparations for the crossing itself to policies for the future: organizational structure, military framework, industry, agriculture, education, government organization, and more.

Every day, the discussion group's bulletin board was filled with updates. Those who had registered for the crossing operation could participate in real-time discussions.

Parliamentary democracy? Separation of powers? Constitutional monarchy? Authoritarianism? Nationalism? Socialism?

Everyone wanted to be the theorist of the New World.

The debates were intensely lively, with all manner of views and opinions emerging in endless succession. To become a reviser of history, to usurp the Ming or supplant the Qing, was the dream of many. But what kind of new world to build was clearly a matter of differing opinions. From democracy versus dictatorship, peace versus militarism, parliament versus centralization... all the way to uniform design, whether to mandate universal education, what language the military should use for drill commands, even the peerage system—everything was contested. Spittle and invective flew together; labels and cudgels came in every color.

The Executive Committee took an attitude of non-participation and no comment toward the heated discussions. Since everyone wanted to argue, let them argue to their hearts' content. Better to argue now than on the beaches of Hainan. Besides, people tended to reveal their true colors online—this would deepen their understanding of these individuals and help select suitable core personnel.

It was hard to say by what organizational structure or electoral principle this Executive Committee had been established, or by what authority it decided who could join. To modern people accustomed to democratic rights, this might seem inexplicable. But on reflection, there was nothing strange about it: during the year-long preparation period, the transmigrators had never actually held a full assembly, nor had they ever elected anyone to any position. In fact, this was impossible—the participants were constantly in flux. Active voices at one meeting might vanish by the next, while new people would request to join. Xiao Zishan had been trying to compile a roster; it took him nearly half a year to more or less succeed. With the membership in constant flux, Wen Desi, Xiao Zishan, and Wang Luobin—who had been managing the day-to-day preparations—naturally became the core of the Executive Committee.

At this point, they were in no hurry to expand the committee. Though the three came from different backgrounds, living environments, educational levels, and workplaces, in many respects they understood each other intuitively. When some people demanded to report immediately, the committee unanimously replied without discussion: the basic infrastructure was not yet in place; they would have to wait a while longer. They understood clearly: the more crossing capital they accumulated now, the more important their positions would be in the future power structure.

In Xiao Zishan's view, seniority was always a valuable intangible asset. Especially in social organizations like this one, length of tenure often determined one's voice and prestige. At present, they knew little about the circumstances of many transmigrators. Letting them join too early would grant some people seniority disproportionate to their actual abilities—detrimental to future work.

Wen Desi's considerations were more pragmatic: in this timespace, there was no shortage of impetuous blowhards—good at making trouble, useless at accomplishing anything. The best way to filter them out was to let time erode their momentary impulses.

Of course, this quiet period couldn't last too long. The preparations involved far too much specialized knowledge and skill for the three of them to handle alone—the Executive Committee needed fresh blood. After a brief meeting, they decided time was of the essence: they would cross again immediately to secure enough funds to enter the substantive preparation phase.

"Our master has given instructions: when the gentlemen arrive, please change first. The master will be out shortly." A steward respectfully ushered them into a small courtyard.

The courtyard was compact and refined, shaded by graceful trees and shrubs—very elegant and tranquil. On a side table sat several wooden trays, complete with robes, caps, and shoes.

Wen Desi and the others did not yet know that Master Gao had gifted the mirrored compacts and other curiosities to more than a dozen high officials and nobles with whom he had regular dealings—causing a sensation throughout Guangzhou. Glass mirrors were something ordinary people, even well-to-do ones, had mostly only heard of; few had actually seen one. Much less the compact itself, which was utterly unprecedented. Buyers were streaming to his shop in an endless procession. Compacts bought for ten taels were resold for fifty—and still snatched up immediately.

Master Gao had traded in foreign goods for over twenty years. Though he had built up a considerable enterprise, he had never before made such a splash. Over the past fortnight, visiting peers had, as the saying went, worn down his threshold. Everyone wanted to worm out of him where the goods came from. These seasoned maritime traders naturally knew that no Portuguese, Dutch, or English merchant carried such wares, and it wasn't their shipping season anyway.

The most likely explanation was that new overseas merchants had arrived in Guangzhou—and Master Gao had taken them in. While many regretted how ill-informed their own eyes and ears had been, suspicious figures had begun lurking around the Gao residence and shop. This put Master Gao on alert. Though he had Eunuch Yang as his backer, every player in the Guangzhou maritime trade was a force to be reckoned with. He was being more careful now; the house-buying errand Wen Desi had entrusted to him was temporarily on hold.

At this point, Gao Ju could no longer afford to worry about how suspicious these people were. A merchant's defining trait was the pursuit of profit. His greater concern was that the Australian merchants were too conspicuous—hence these arrangements. He didn't want anyone learning the source of his goods. This monumental fortune had to remain firmly in his own grasp.

Wen Desi and Wang Luobin exchanged a glance; they could roughly guess what Master Gao was planning. But keeping a low profile suited their intentions just fine. They proceeded to change clothes.

Only—how exactly did one wear Ming-era attire? They couldn't make heads or tails of it. None of them were Hanfu enthusiasts, and after much fumbling, they managed more or less to get dressed. The steward came in to serve tea, saw their caps askew and collars crooked—utterly disheveled—and had no choice but to summon a maidservant to assist them.

Wealthy families in Guangdong customarily kept servant girls. The steward knew these guests were people the master wished to cultivate, so the maids he called were naturally of good quality: two fifteen- or sixteen-year-old girls with bright, sparkling eyes, pretty and charming. They came in, curtsied gracefully, and began to help them out of their poorly-donned garments. Director Wen had seen his share of romantic scenes, but having such soft little *loli* hands touching and tugging at him while loosening his clothes—even he found it a bit much to handle. *Now this is a man's paradise!* he thought.

Lost in reverie, he caught a glimpse of Xiao Zishan wearing the same enraptured expression. He chuckled softly:

"What—are you tempted too?"

"Oh yes. This is the life a man should be living." Xiao Zishan recalled his ex-girlfriend's domineering ways: *feudal society has its bright side.*

"You said it!" Wang Luobin was indignant. "Modern society is the collapse of ritual and the decay of propriety." He launched into a tirade about how his wife—a graduate of the Physical Education department—was such-and-such and so-and-so. His grievances overflowed, leaving Xiao Zishan and Wen Desi fully acquainted with the formidable power of Mrs. Wang.

The two young attendants with their hair in double buns stood to the side. They heard Wang Luobin speak on and on, but couldn't quite understand. They saw only his animated face and gesticulating hands; the cap they had just straightened had slipped again and now sagged over his forehead. Both ducked their heads, biting their lips to suppress their giggles.

Xiao Zishan nudged the impassioned Wang Luobin: "Engineer Wang, what do you think of these little maids? Have a word with Master Gao—take one back with you?"

Wang Luobin shook his head vigorously: "She's a middle-schooler! How could I!"

"So if she were a high-schooler, you could?" Xiao Zishan teased. "Raise her first; in a few years she'll be ripe..."

"A *loli cultivation plan*?" Wen Desi interjected. "I'm rather interested myself." He looked the girls up and down appraisingly. Though these two were a bit thin and small, they were fair-skinned with delicate features—with better nutrition, good stock...

While the big bad wolf's eyes roved over the little white rabbits, the curtain parted and Master Gao strode in. Seeing the scene, he could not help but smile faintly. These sea merchants spent years in the wind and waves; once ashore, every one of them was a hungry ghost for women. The Dutch and Portuguese were even worse—they'd take any kind of woman.

But he said nothing of it, merely cupped his hands and bowed: "Honored guests, have you been well?"
