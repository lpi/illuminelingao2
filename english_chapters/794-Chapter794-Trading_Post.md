# Chapter 794 – Trading Post

The difficulty didn't lie in reliability—according to the Li and Miao Affairs Office's report, at least all Li hamlets and Miao fortresses within Lingao's borders "wholeheartedly supported" the new regime. Three years of work hadn't been in vain. Rather, a large portion of the Li and Miao population suffered from malaria. Hainan gazetteers often mentioned that "Li people are sickly." Although health teams dispatched by the Ministry of Health deep into Li areas observed that most malaria cases among the Li and Miao were benign, intermittent attacks made it difficult to fully utilize them as general labor or soldiers.

"I don't see a big problem. Don't the Li people revolt frequently? They have strength to revolt but not to be soldiers?" Si Kaide said. "Besides, some must have immunity. Otherwise, how could the Li survive in the mountains for so long?"

"That's why Li revolts are frequent but their combat power is limited. The Ming, relying on a bunch of beggar-like Wei-Suo troops guarding a few forts, can keep them in check," Dongmen Chuiyu said. "The army needs to drill, train, and stand guard daily. If you don't know which day a soldier will get the shakes, the army can't function."

"It's a waste not to use such manpower," Si Kaide couldn't let go of the Li people idea. "Can't we treat them?"

"Let's think of specific methods later." Dongmen Chuiyu didn't want to reveal the military's specific ideas and glossed over it. Since the Executive Committee was reluctant to expand military personnel by cutting the labor force under its rule, yet demands for military power from all sides only increased, the large number of highly dispersed public security and internal defense tasks impacted the army's normal education and training. The idea of recruiting mercenaries for public security missions to free the regular army from such duties was brought up informally in internal Military Affairs Command meetings. Li and Miao soldiers were just one option.

Once the Hong Kong development plan was announced, it immediately triggered a new wave of office-seeking. Although the Second Plenary Session established the "voluntary registration, organizational review" principle for official selection, many people, besides signing up on the internal Organization Department website, privately visited various figures they thought influential. Ming Lang had to stay within the General Office compound for days to avoid being dragged out for "a meal and a chat."

After fierce behind-the-scenes maneuvering, a list of officials for the Hong Kong region was finally announced: Tiandihui technician Luo Chen would serve as Commander of the Hong Kong Reclamation Regiment; Shi Zhiqi as Hong Kong Garrison Commander; Le Lin as Commander of the Hong Kong Navy Detachment; and Hong Shuiyin as Hong Kong Commercial Representative.

Additionally, a group of technical cadres was assigned to Hong Kong, including Shi Jiantao, a strong advocate for building a shipyard there. Originally with the Planning Academy and very interested in shipbuilding, he volunteered to be the director of the Hong Kong Shipyard.

Shi Zhiqi's appointment as Garrison Commander initially faced opposition; the Army felt it unreasonable for Navy personnel to hold all senior military posts in Hong Kong. However, consensus was eventually reached: the Garrison Commander should be someone with amphibious warfare experience, and Shi Zhiqi was clearly the most qualified candidate.

In response to the increasing number of dispatched elders, the House of Elders formally implemented the "Elder Committee" and "Collective Decision-Making for Major Affairs" system for all groups of two or more dispatched elders. Any location with more than three elders had to form a local Elder Committee; local major policy decisions had to be announced or voted on in committee meetings. The committee had to meet regularly and keep minutes.

Escorted by two patrol boats, the *Qionghai Coal* slowly docked at Central Pier No. 1 on "Saintess Bay"—the Central State Council had officially issued a naming document renaming Xiangshan Ao (Heung Shan O) to "Hong Kong Island," Base 852 to "Central," and Victoria Harbor to "Saintess Bay," replacing the name of the nonexistent Queen Victoria.

Several people in gray and green uniforms stood on the *Qionghai Coal*'s deck, gesturing at the Central Base under construction. Their tall, strong builds and better clothing identified them as so-called "elders." Soldiers working as stevedores on the pier whispered among themselves—did the arrival of another batch of elders mean a new operation was starting? After the military operations in the Pearl River basin ended, many elders left Hong Kong one after another. Now only two or three remained on the island.

Towed by a Daihatsu landing craft, the *Big Whale* slowly came alongside the trestle, and a gangplank was extended. While port personnel boarded for inspection, several elders disembarked. A twenty-five or twenty-six-year-old elder, who had been in a small shed by the pier, walked quickly to meet them.

"Engineer Mei! You're here." The young man greeted an elder in his thirties coming off the ship—Mei Lin from the General Construction Company.

"Little Shi, you've done not bad here." Mei Lin looked around. "Four months, and it's taking shape."

A sharp whistle blew—the port authority noticed the red warning flag symbolizing highest danger flying on *Qionghai Coal*. Laborers and soldiers working near Pier No. 1 quickly evacuated.

"What? You brought dangerous goods." Little Shi's expression changed slightly.

"Explosives," Mei Lin said briefly. "Didn't you apply for explosives for quarrying?"

"Right, right. Let's go first."

They skipped pleasantries and quickly followed "Little Shi" toward the trading post at Central Base. The trading post was over a kilometer from the seaside pier; the construction team had built a wrought-iron standard-gauge track to transport goods and personnel between the two points.

Since the Pearl River Detachment landed in Hong Kong in September 1630, development of Base 852 had been ongoing, and the planned Central Base had taken rough shape. The trading post was the core building of the entire base, the fortress and foundation of rule. This structure was designed comprehensively, based on the 19th-century armed trading post model with reference to modern government public building design experience. Though not large, its supporting facilities were complete.

The main citadel was a rectangular multi-story hollow building. The structure was essentially multi-story buildings surrounding a large open space. At the four corners were four bastions, each 5 stories high, 17 meters tall. The tops were open-air gun platforms. Below were guard quarters, ammunition depots, gyms… The lowest level was toilets, flushed with seawater.

Apart from the bastions, all floors were 4 stories high, 14 meters. The first and second floors facing outward had no windows; windows started from the third floor up, equipped with iron shutters that could be closed during attacks. However, facing the internal courtyard, every floor had windows for ventilation and light. The roof terraces had defensive works.

The south-facing building was the external office area; the ground floor held the main hall and gate. All agencies dealing with the public were located here. In the middle of the south building was a five-story clock tower. The east building was the dormitory area, housing guard troops and naturalized staff and cadres. Each floor had large washrooms. Part of the ground floor was the cafeteria and kitchen, part was the armory. The west side was also four stories: first and second floors for warehouses, third for a health clinic and inpatient ward, fourth for dormitories. The north side held auxiliary utility rooms, including boiler room, pump room, and wind power station. It also housed a temporary detention center and various storerooms—including a garage on the ground floor.

The trading post wasn't fully finished, but the four corner towers, the south main gate building, and the clock tower were complete. Although clock towers were designed into many Lingao buildings, no large clock had been manufactured yet—not that they couldn't, but the Planning Academy felt it wasn't urgent and preferred to wait for more abundant raw materials.

At the foot of the main citadel, following the model of East Gate City's construction, roads were paved. A commercial hall and customs house were under construction. Piles of yellow sand, barrels of cement, and stones of various sizes lay everywhere. Laborers bustled back and forth. Work shanties and the chugging of steam rollers merged into a din.

The labor force used personnel from the locally established purification camp. Guangdong civilians and soldiers captured or volunteering during the Pearl River estuary campaign underwent quarantine here while serving as construction workers. The Lingao General Construction Company sent an elder named Shi Dafu to oversee all local engineering construction. Shi Dafu was a civil engineering graduate who had worked in construction companies—a doer with both theory and experience.

Shi Dafu led the group into the main citadel and invited them to sit in the conference room located in the south clock tower. Introductions followed. Among the new elders, Mei Lin came to supervise several reservoir projects on Hong Kong Island—to set up operations in Hong Kong, the Planning Academy calculated a need for 2 million cubic meters of water storage by the 1631-1632 year, and 7.7 million cubic meters by 1633. This would effectively supply the needs of industrial and agricultural production on Hong Kong Island.

"Most Hong Kong reservoirs will use existing mountain terrain, so earthwork volume is limited," Mei Lin brought a full set of hydrological data on Hong Kong from the old time-space provided by the Grand Library. "However, the cost is still significant."

Given the premise of occupying all of Guangzhou after the Second Five-Year Plan, the Planning Academy considered excessive investment in Hong Kong not worthwhile. Therefore, the scale of industry and agriculture in Hong Kong was strictly limited. The projected total population for Hong Kong and the outlying islands—including garrison, workers, reclamation personnel, and those awaiting purification residing for over 30 days—would not exceed 30,000.
