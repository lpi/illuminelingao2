# Chapter 243: Bai Guoshi's Romance

Multipass. Swipe his card at the entrance of the residential area, seeing people playing PSP in the square, he felt a sense of returning to the civilized world. Some were also playing badminton, table tennis, and so on. He had no mood to watch and returned to his dormitory. He shared a dorm with Cui Yunhong and Dong Shiye—the latter occasionally participated in the exploration team's operations.

Cui Yunhong disappeared somewhere after eating, and Dong Shiye was still at work, so the dormitory was empty with just him. As material conditions improved, the dormitory also had furniture—in the past, everyone slept on floor mats. Now decorated anew, Bai Guoshi really suspected he had returned to his past university dormitory: loft beds with sleeping space above and a desk below; individual storage lockers and wardrobes; racks for cups and washbasins. The most conspicuous item was the gun rack behind the door—chained to it was an SKS-D rifle, with a full magazine on the gun. The only downside was that there was still no internet, and electricity usage was restricted, with power supply only from 6 PM to 9 PM.

Bai Guoshi went to the bathroom for a shower. The water was cold; hot water was only supplied at night, but he was used to it. The sound of water splashing came from the women's bathroom next door; presumably, someone was showering there too—unfortunately, the design of this bathroom was quite artistic: the male and female entrances were separated, with the women's entrance leading directly into the interior of Group 6. After showering, he washed his clothes by the way. several people in the dorm liked to hoard dirty clothes until they had nothing to wear before washing, making the room always smell like stinking salted fish. Every time Fang Yijing came to inspect dormitory hygiene, she gave them a "Poor" rating.

Dragging a pair of slippers, Bai Guoshi returned sluggishly from the bathhouse. The room was still empty—no chance to even find someone to play PES with. He dug out a ziplock plastic bag from his cupboard; inside was a carton of cigarettes. In the original world, he had never touched a bit of tobacco, but now he really wanted a puff. He went out and sat under a tree in the square. Taking the first drag, he choked tears out of his eyes instantly. He hurriedly extinguished the cigarette, but the tears couldn't stop, pouring out under the pretext of the smoke. The almost uninterrupted exploration missions for several months had made him numb, but a cigarette released everything: parents, friends, classmates were all before his eyes: *I'm really f*cking sick, running here. I don't even have a girlfriend, haven't even touched a woman's hand...*

A tissue was handed into his hand. Looking up, it was Zhao Xue: "Didn't expect you to cry too, humph." She had a mischievous smile on her face.

"Choked by smoke." He took the tissue and said. Zhao Xue's hair was wet, and his heart couldn't help but stir.

"Who believes that? Crying isn't wrong."

"Is your knee better?" Bai Guoshi didn't want to show weakness in front of a woman.

"Just went to the hospital for treatment, applied medicine, doesn't hurt much anymore." Zhao Xue openly pulled up her pant leg and moved her knee.

The young woman's snow-white, firm calf and the white skin faintly revealed on her knee were exposed within inches of the innocent university graduate. The smell of camphor tincture mixed with a scent like orchid or fragrance drifted over faintly, and Xiao Bai once again felt his ears were boiling in hot water.

"Good that it's fine, good."

"Let's go, wash your face. We'll sort out the report later; you have to present tonight."

"Right, right." Bai Guoshi hadn't expected this girl to openly invite him to organize data together and couldn't help but be ecstatic. He immediately threw his depressed mood to the nine heavens. "I'll go wash up right now. Meet in the office in a bit?"

"No need, I'll just wait for you in the square. It's quite a long walk; we can talk on the way."

Bai Guoshi was dizzy from the impact of happiness. When he stood up, he actually swayed a few times before going joyfully.

The report meeting for the 45th Long-Range Exploration Operation convened on time at 19:00 in the Executive Committee compound.

Several bigwigs of the Executive Committee sat solemnly behind a horseshoe-shaped table, facing a row of seats in the middle. It was said that someone arranged the furniture based on the US Congressional Hearing model.

Those participating in the report were Liu Zheng, Cui Yunhong, Huang Zhuazi, and Bai Guoshi. Zhao Xue and Ye Mengyan were not professionals in this field and didn't need to attend.

"Gentlemen, please sit. Captain Liu, the report you sent tonight is good and has great reference value. Now we want to hear an oral report," Wen Desi said.

"Thank you. Which parts should we discuss first?"

"Let's talk about the biological field guide first."

"I suggest Xiao Bai report on this; he is more professional."

Bai Guoshi began his report: "Creating a biological field guide is mainly because the Ministry of Health has notified us several times about incidents of accidental ingestion of poisonous mushrooms. The cafeteria also refuses to use any wild fungi for fear of poisonous ones. Harmful creatures here also attack transmigrators and our laborers. So our idea is to compile a set of biological field guides, tentatively releasing two types first. One is for local edible or usable animals, plants, and wild fungi, for reference by various departments; the second is a harmful organism atlas, including various venomous snakes, poisonous insects, parasites, poisonous plants, etc., for safety publicity use. We have already started working on the first type of guide."

"Good idea." Xiao Zishan, Director of the General Office, nodded. "Later it can be printed in color and published. One copy per person." The other committee members also nodded in succession.

"The future plan is that this identification atlas can be extended to other aspects, including minerals and the like..."

"Also regarding our department's issues, concerning the Long-Range Exploration Team itself, we believe the current number of personnel is far from sufficient and urgently needs strengthening. If there is only one team, in case we are ambushed outside, the Transmigration Regime will lose its entire long-range exploration force. I personally suggest establishing at least three six-man reconnaissance squads, training them by pairing veterans with novices. Avoiding the situation where if a professional in a certain field dies, there is no successor—our line of work is a high-risk profession, with such possibilities at any time. In addition, having three teams allows simultaneous investigation in two directions, leaving one on standby. In terms of personnel, we need at least 12 more people, ideally with some outdoor activity experience. We must ensure each squad has one person with military service experience. regarding equipment, shotguns are scarce now, so we won't apply for more, but at least give us six more steel crossbows and three walkie-talkies, ensuring each squad has one gun, two crossbows, and two walkie-talkies. Additionally, we want to apply for absolute power usage rights for two laptops to ensure intelligence organization and guide compilation..."

Bai Guoshi spoke more and more happily and fluently, but suddenly he noticed all the committee members looking at him with astonished eyes. *Big sweat*, he had gotten too carried away—these were Liu Zheng's lines! How did he usurp the host's role and steal the leader's report?

"...Uhh, I've finished reporting... the report was very incomplete..." Bai Guoshi began to stammer.

"Thank you for your report," Wen Desi said softly.

After Bai Guoshi finished reporting, Cui Yunhong reported on the mineral situation discovered during this exploration, focusing on the discovery of the kaolin mine and the speculation of nearby lignite. Neither resource was urgently needed, plus there was a Wei-Suo city nearby—according to Yu Eshui's research, it was probably the station of that Rear Thousand-Household Fort of Lingao.

"Might as well wipe out this Thousand-Household Fort," Ma Qianzhu said. "Thousand-Household Liu is already a figure with public grievances; getting rid of him can win over a large batch of military households to defect."

"It should be very easy to fight; the Thousand-Household Fort's defensive capability is very poor," Liu Zheng said. "I can't see any self-defense capability; I wrote the specific situation in the report. In my view, it's worse than Lingao County—at least Lingao has higher walls than it."

"Let's discuss this later." The conservatives still had concerns about directly attacking Ming government institutions.

"We can organize resource expeditions. Use force to protect laborers to collect resources; we stay in our lane, they stay in theirs." Wu Nanhai took the opportunity to propose his opinion and elaborated on the benefits of such a practice.

"Go to Wenchang once, and you can have as many coconuts as you want, without spending money." Wu Nanhai continued to agitate. "Now even if we spend money, they won't ship them here!"

"Why is that? Low price?"

"The price we offer is double that of Qiongshan!" Mo Xiao'an was indignant—Lin Quan'an, who went to the Wenchang area to buy coconuts, returned empty-handed, and several of the staff he took were beaten and injured. The various "Hegemons" that existed in the original timeline existed in this timeline too—the copra trade was monopolized by several merchants in Qiongshan County, and outsiders were not allowed to intervene. Even if he offered a high price, the farmers harvesting coconuts dared not sell to him.

"What's the Exploration Team's opinion?"

"We have no objection. As long as the Executive Committee organizes it, we will certainly serve well as pathfinders and guides."

"Alright then, we'll discuss the details after the meeting." Ma Qianzhu agreed.

"In addition, the Exploration Team needs a survey ship. This way we can conduct round-the-island surveys and also bring the survey team along—after all, ships are much safer than hiking surveys. If something goes wrong, we just retreat to the ship and we're safe."

This reason was so sufficient that it couldn't be refused, but ships were scarce materials.

"We can only allocate some small coastal boats of ten or twenty tons, which probably aren't suitable." Wen Desi hesitated. "It will take some time for the big ship to be completed..."

"President Wen, that two-masted clipper was agreed to belong to our Maritime Power Department!" Li Haiping, the representative of the Maritime Power Department, hurriedly came out to say.

Wen Desi was in a dilemma. The Resource Department's demand wasn't unreasonable, but the Maritime Power Department's urgent need to acquire new ships to increase armed force and transport capacity was also a reality.

"How about this: the ship and sailor establishment will still be listed under the Maritime Power Department, and the Exploration Team can call upon it when needed—guaranteeing priority use for the Exploration Team." Ma Qianzhu came up with a solution that offended neither side. "Sailors are also in short supply now; it's better to be managed uniformly by the Maritime Power Department."

"That works too." Liu Zheng knew the possibility of getting the new ship wasn't high. "But I hope the Navy can help train us in boat handling knowledge and such, so we won't be helpless when equipped with boats in the future."

"Leave that to me, brother," Li Haiping agreed readily.
