# Chapter 1343 Mao Shisan

Hearing that some generals on the islands had taken their own troops to join Li Jiucheng, people had recently been constantly coming to Zhenjiang Fort and various nearby settlements of Dongjiang, inciting officers and soldiers to follow them to Shandong to fight. Without exception, these people brought shiny silver, making many people red-eyed with envy. They gritted their teeth, took up their swords and spears, and followed along.

Mao Shisan was also tempted, but being tempted was one thing, whether anyone wanted a stick-thin boy like him was another matter. Moreover, crossing the sea to go to the unfamiliar Shandong to fight against the imperial court, Mao Shisan had no confidence in his heart. The most crucial problem was that on the way to join the army from here, no one could guarantee whether there would be food to eat. If he starved to death halfway, what was the point of talking about silver?

Putting aside the matter of joining the army for now, the fact that his stomach was hungry and he needed to eat was an imminent matter. It had been snowing these past few days, and he should have huddled in the shed moving as little as possible to conserve energy, but Mao Shisan really couldn't hold on anymore—there was no food left at home.

Mao Shisan had no parents since childhood and was adopted by a fellow villager of his father. The two depended on each other for survival. His stepfather had a salary, although it wasn't paid for even a month in a year. Don't look at the dilapidated condition of the various settlements in Dongjiang Town, where soldiers were ragged and starving, no different from beggars, but it was a place where rice was as precious as pearls and firewood as cassia. A shi of rice was several times or even a dozen times more expensive than in the capital, let alone Jiangnan.

Similar situations existed in all border towns. Because embezzling military pay had become the main way for generals to get rich, they all disliked grain and cloth which were heavy and troublesome to cash out, requesting the imperial court to transport silver instead. For the handling officials, transporting much smaller volumes of silver was also more convenient than transporting bulky grain and cloth.

The influx of a large amount of silver inevitably caused the prices of all goods to soar. So although the soldiers in various border towns seemingly had wages higher than the national average level, the local prices were several times or even a dozen times the national average.

The situation in Dongjiang was even worse. Dongjiang not only had a large population to feed, but its jurisdiction was also in a bitter cold and barren place where soldiers couldn't even farm to feed themselves. Although the generals could obtain income by smuggling goods with the Manchus, collecting protection fees from smuggling merchants, and digging ginseng and hunting for furs, these incomes had nothing to do with the military household soldiers. Instead, it increased their burden—historically, the fuse for Huang Long being beaten and detained by mutinous soldiers was his driving of hunger and cold-stricken soldiers to dig ginseng.

After Li Jiucheng rebelled last year, most of the imperial military pay and merchants' goods transported from Dengzhou were cut off. The days of the soldiers and masses who were already half-starved and barely surviving became even harder to endure. To a certain extent, this became the motivation that stimulated a large number of Dongjiang soldiers to cross the sea to participate in the rebellion.

Those with strength and daring all ran away one after another, leaving behind the old, weak, sick, and disabled. Mao Shisan's stepfather was assigned an errand yesterday. At least he would have a meal today, and maybe he could bring back some leftovers when he came back tomorrow. But Mao Shisan was already dizzy from hunger and couldn't wait until tomorrow.

He dragged his weak steps to the coast. There was no sign of life on the frozen coast, let alone the food he wanted to eat. He felt that he was already hallucinating. Not far away, a small boat was rowing towards him. His eyes blurred and he fell down, then he knew nothing.

Mao Shisan only felt a ball of fire in front of his eyes. He wanted to open his eyes, but his eyelids were very heavy. But there was one thing he was very sure of, that is, it was quite warm, warmer than roasting by the fire at home. People feel particularly safe in a warm environment. He didn't know if it was an illusion, but he felt less hungry and urgently wanted to sleep. He remembered that his stepfather and many people had told him that one must never fall asleep while walking outside in winter, for once asleep, one would never wake up again.

However, he really didn't have the strength to open his eyes. Thinking that if he died, he died, he went back to sleep.

When Mao Shisan woke up, he was already lying in a cabin. It turned out that he didn't die but was rescued onto a ship by a group of strange short-haired people.

A young man with short hair and a short jacket was busy beside him. According to him, the "Chief" found him fainting by the sea. It was snowing at that time. If the Chief hadn't shown mercy, he would have long frozen to death on the beach.

"You've been sleeping for a day and a night. I've fed you sugar water several times," the young man said, "otherwise you would have died long ago. Drink a bowl of gruel."

He had no impression of being fed sugar water, but his body indeed didn't feel as weak as before.

"Come, drink a bowl of gruel." The young man brought a large bowl filled with something like steaming hot mixed grain gruel. Mao Shisan hadn't seen proper grain for quite some days. Seeing this bowl of gruel, his saliva flowed like a sluice gate opening, and he couldn't even say a word of thanks as it stuck in his throat.

The hot gruel in his mouth was solid grain. The delicious taste was something he had never eaten in his life. This also made him feel slightly at ease. After drinking the gruel, he wanted to get up, only to find it wasn't that easy. It seemed he was sleeping in a net.

"You eat a bowl first. I'll bring you more later. You were starving badly, eating too much easily causes bloating. Don't be in a hurry to get out of bed. Rest for a while, the Chief wants to see you."

The attitude of the young lad taking care of him was very good. Judging by his age, he wasn't much different from himself, but he exuded a capability that shouldn't belong to this age.

"Since you got on the Chief's boat, just wait to enjoy blessings." Finally, the young lad gave a mysterious smile. "It's better for everyone to know a bit, to be mentally prepared for the situation they will face in the future."

After lunch, Xue Ziliang "received" Mao Shisan. Mao Shisan had never heard of the髡 thieves, but this Chief Xue was obviously a high official on this ship, only he didn't know where he came from. He had seen officials of the Ming Dynasty, none dressed like this. Korean officials dressed similarly to the Ming Dynasty. But the words this Chief Xue spoke were serious Chinese, and quite like the Liaodong Mandarin. His dress was different from the Tartars. Moreover, he didn't have a Tartar tail on his head. Besides, the Tartars couldn't even build decent ships themselves, so they wouldn't have such a good ship at all.

Although he couldn't figure out their background, at least he got food and clothing on the ship currently. Not only did he have delicious gruel to satisfy his hunger, but he was also changed into a new set of clothes. These clothes not only had no patches but were also close-fitting and warm.

After a few sentences, he knew that Chief Xue was at least not a bad person. He was very amiable and didn't put on airs of an official. Especially after knowing that he was a military household of Dongjiang Town, he seemed quite indignant and said a lot of bad things about the imperial court. Only a junior high school student by the standards of this space-time, Mao Shisan had pitifully little experience. Coaxed by a few good words from this old stick Xue Ziliang, he wished he could dig out his heart.

"So your family is military households of this Zhenjiang Fort?"

"Replying to the Master: Before Marshal Mao recovered Zhenjiang Fort, the little one lived here with my stepfather. Except for going to Lushun Fort, I haven't been anywhere else."

"Then tell me, what do the military households in Dongjiang rely on for a living usually? Just relying on the imperial court's pay silver probably won't keep you alive."

"Who says it isn't so? The pay silver doesn't fall into our hands. We are called military households, but we don't have any land to farm. Besides, it's not easy to grow crops in the fields of Liaodong, the weather is terribly cold. A few years ago, we relied on grain transported by the imperial court and Korea, but not much fell into our hands. Usually, we rely on some fishing and hunting, digging some wild vegetables, and can still muddle through half-starved and half-full."

"After Marshal Mao was killed by Governor-General Yuan, some people said Marshal Mao died unjustly. Whether it was unjust or not, we don't understand, but the days are getting harder day by day. The generals kill each other, and many brothers died before and after. We are neither household servants nor personal soldiers, and we don't know what's going on. Just no money and no food. A little grain and pay are tightened for the combat soldiers and household servants. To be honest with the Chief, if I hadn't not seen proper grain for more than two months, the little one wouldn't have risked going out to find food in the middle of winter."

"You are close to the Yalu River here. I heard that Korea also hates the Tartars to the bone and is a tributary of Korea. Why don't you cross the river to Korea to find food? At least you can get by for a while."

"Master doesn't know. Although Korea guards against Tartars, they also guard against us. In our territory, it's not easy to grow some grain. Korea originally provided a lot of grain, weapons, and ships to Dongjiang. How would they be willing if asked again? They can't even feed themselves. In recent years, just hunting and fishing on the border caused constant conflicts. It's okay for large groups of people to go out, but for a lone person like the little one, crossing the river and meeting Koreans would get me beaten to death just the same—besides, we have to guard against Tartars. If caught by Tartars, even if not dead, I'd lose a layer of skin."

"There seem to be many forests here. Are there big trees in the forest that can be used to build ships?"

"This is true. When the weather gets warm, people go into the mountains to log, float them down the river to the fort, and then tie them into rafts. But there are too many of these things, and they can't be used up. Recently, I only heard that more warships are to be built, so a lot were cut. However, people in the fort also secretly fished some out themselves." Speaking of this, Mao Shisan lowered his voice, "I heard they want to build ships to go join Marshal Li."

"So, this Li Jiucheng has quite high prestige in Dongjiang," Xue Ziliang thought. They didn't know yet that Kong Youde and Li Jiucheng had already been defeated! But this was not surprising. How much news could such military household children in a remote place like Zhenjiang Fort know?

"Marshal Li was formerly the Vice Commander of Dongjiang, his prestige here is very high."

"I heard that Dongjiang Town is now presided over by Governor Huang. He is a greatly loyal subject. The soldiers below are still willing to follow Li Jiucheng to rebel?"

"Whether Governor Huang is a loyal subject or not, the little one doesn't know. We little ones only beg to eat a few full meals—after Marshal Huang came, there was still no food to eat. Master, you are my great benefactor. Otherwise, the little one would have long perished."

"So the military households of Dongjiang are simply doing it for a mouthful of food."

"Who says it isn't so? The Tartars are too cruel. Falling into their hands is worse than pigs and dogs. But the imperial court doesn't welcome us either—everyone says they dislike us for only taking grain and pay but not fighting—Header's conscience, how much rice from the imperial court can we small military households eat a year? Like beggars, we can't send troops to fight either." Mao Shisan actually started complaining of injustice.
