# Chapter 2575 - Divination

Now the Australians were repeating the First Emperor's old tricks. What virtue and ability did they have to be confident they wouldn't repeat those mistakes?

He Wuzhou coughed lightly and said: "This Baldy administration, when you examine it, has nothing new. It's merely Shang Yang's old methods. Qin ruled by Legalism. Though it unified the Six States, its governance was harsh and the people couldn't survive. In the end it fell after just two generations. Doesn't the Australians' so-called Senate know this? Even if they don't, you, Mengliang, surely know. As their Consultative Councillor, haven't you offered advice? Since ancient times, governing a great nation is like cooking a small fish—you cannot stir too vigorously. These Baldies, since entering Guangzhou, have implemented many good policies, yet they're overly hasty, with governance too fierce and severe. This is surely not the way to lasting peace and stability."

This sentiment was actually the shared view of quite a few scholars with some knowledge of the Senate. They recognized the Senate's governing capability but still couldn't shake their inner doubts—after all, the Qin dynasty's lesson was too profound.

"Not so," Liu Dalin said. "Qin's fall was not due to Qin law, but due to the First Emperor and Second Emperor's abuse of the people's labor." Liu Dalin continued: "Later, Emperor Wu of Han was no different, and if not for the painstaking management by Emperors Zhao and Xuan leading to restoration, the Han might have lost the deer before Wang Mang even had a chance to usurp."

All present were scholars of deep learning, well-versed in classics, histories, masters, and collections, thoroughly familiar with historical affairs through the ages. They weren't pedantic scholars knowing only the Thirteen Classics. Though each had different views on the political gains and losses of successive dynasties, in the end, the collapse of dynasties could mostly be attributed to four words: "the people cannot survive."

They felt: today's Great Ming was also beginning to travel that same road. He Wuzhou had recently received multiple letters from classmates and relatives serving in the capital, all warning him that court deliberations had approved levying the "Qiong Surcharge" for three years and the "Suppression Surcharge" for one year, selecting a military supervisor with intentions of mounting a southern campaign. They urged him to "make early preparations."

The gathered elder statesmen mostly didn't hold much hope for the court's southern campaign. They had seen and heard the Baldies' military strength and financial power, knowing it all too clearly. No matter who came to supervise the campaign, hoping to settle things in one battle was pure fantasy. Nine times out of ten it would stall north of the Five Ridges. A prolonged standoff like Liaodong—though called "three years of Qiong Surcharge," would likely continue indefinitely like the Liaodong Surcharge.

"No, no!" In a moment, someone else joined the debate.

...

Liu Dalin had been debating for so long his mouth had gone dry. He knew that continuing this classical debate for seven days and seven nights would still be futile. He said: "Do my elder brothers remember? In those days I passed the examination through the *Book of Changes*. Since you all believe the Ming dynasty's fortune hasn't been exhausted, why not divine by the *Changes*, asking Heaven itself? What do you say?"

The art of divination had existed since antiquity. Courts throughout history had officials responsible for divining auspicious and inauspicious omens. The Jiajing Emperor was also devoted to cultivating immortality, so divination was extremely popular in the Ming. Never mind scholar-officials—even the Emperor himself, in desperate straits, had to seek guidance from Heaven. Legend had it that before hanging himself, Chongzhen was psychologically "attacked" by Li Zicheng's strategist Song Xiance through divination. When Li Zicheng's army reached the capital, the restless Chongzhen and eunuch Wang Chengen left the palace to relax and encountered Song Xiance disguised as a fortune-teller. The distraught Chongzhen wrote the character "you" [酉]. Song Xiance handed him a slip of paper, saying this was heavenly secrets that could only be opened at midnight. Chongzhen returned to the palace and at midnight opened the slip. It read: "The Great Ming Son of Heaven was originally honored; but 'honored' [尊] with head and tail removed becomes 'you' [酉]. The realm hangs by a thread."

Lingnan customs were superstitious to begin with, so these brilliant scholar-officials saw nothing improper about Liu Dalin's suggestion. Zhao Xunru said: "There are various methods of divination: tortoise shell, yarrow stalks, copper coins, drawing lots. Which method does Mengliang propose?"

Liu Dalin said: "Tortoise shells and yarrow stalks cannot be obtained quickly. Copper coins and drawing lots are methods for country bumpkins. I shall use chess divination."

"What is chess divination?"

"Go pieces are black and white—the image of yin and yang. Therefore, chess pieces substitute for yarrow stalks."

Chen Zilü, as host, quickly had someone bring a go set.

Under everyone's gaze, Liu Dalin took fifty exquisite jade chess pieces from the set and placed them on the ox-bone board to begin the calculation.

Liu Dalin calmly used his pipe to randomly remove one piece from the pile and set it aside. This was the principle of "The great expansion number is fifty; its use is forty-nine." Setting one aside to represent Taiji, the forty-nine symbolized all things in the world. Then he used his pipe to randomly divide the forty-nine pieces into two groups—left for "Heaven," right for "Earth." The piece from before symbolized "Man," thus completing the "Three Powers" of Heaven, Earth, and Man.

Next, Liu Dalin began counting the pieces in the left "Heaven" group, four at a time. This "dividing by four" symbolized the four seasons, and the remainder was set aside. After counting the left, he continued with the right side's "Earth," likewise setting aside the remainder. Then he combined the piece symbolizing "Man" with the removed pieces—totaling five. (This step would always yield either five or nine. If not, something had been miscounted.) This process was called "one change."

Then he mixed the two remaining piles back together and repeated the process—this was "the second change." Repeating this for "three changes," the remaining pieces divided by four yielded one yao line. After six yao lines and eighteen changes, one hexagram was complete.

After completing three changes, Liu Dalin drew a long horizontal line on xuan paper with a brush and called out: "Young yang."

A moment later, he drew two short horizontal lines above the first yao line: "Young yin."

As this yin and yang hexagram gradually took shape on the paper, the onlookers couldn't help but feel anxious for the Great Ming's fate.

"Young yang."

"Young yin."

"Young yin."

After the fifth yao line appeared, the result became clearer. Only one line remained—either a yang line or a yin line. Chen Zizhuang held out a sliver of hope, thinking: "Perhaps it's Mountain-Fire Adornment, still an upper-middle hexagram."

"Old yin."

As Liu Dalin drew the final yao line, everyone's hearts sank. It was the thirty-sixth hexagram of the *Book of Changes*: "Ming Yi"—Brightness Wounded.

Seeing everyone silent, Liu Dalin said: "This hexagram has only one old yin in the sixth position. With one changing line, we read the moving line's statement of the original hexagram. The text says: 'Top Six: Not bright but dark. First rising to heaven, later entering the earth.' Ming Yi is the hexagram of darkness and obscurity—when darkness rules above, the bright are wounded below."

The Ming Yi hexagram's image was Li (fire/sun) below, Kun (earth) above. Sun entering earth, unable to shine forth, as if wounded—hence called Ming Yi, a lower-balanced hexagram. In human affairs, this represented a corrupt ruler above and virtuous ministers below, unable to exercise their abilities, in extremely dire circumstances. As the saying goes: "Fortune turns against you—can't run away. In panic crossing the river, the bridge falls. The benefactor becomes ungrateful—turns into resentment. All efforts in vain—all toil for nothing."

At this scene, He Wuzhou's face went pale, Yao Dian and Chen Zilü fell silent, and Zhao Xunru couldn't help shedding tears. Could Heaven really be destroying the Great Ming?

Only Chen Zizhuang remained unwilling to accept it. He said: "This hexagram still has room for reversal. Extreme yin transforms—things turn around at their worst. The top yao is old yin. If the top yao moves, it changes to Mountain-Fire Adornment. The text says: 'Top nine: White adornment, no blame.' The top achieves its will. Our current holy Son of Heaven assumed the throne at sixteen and immediately executed the eunuch Wei Zhongxian and rectified the inner palace. Day after day amid internal and external crises, he rises early and retires late, never enjoying a single day of leisure—all for restoring the Great Ming's mountains and rivers. Ritual has three foundations: Heaven and Earth are the foundation of life; ancestors are the foundation of our kind; sovereign and teacher are the foundation of governance. Heaven and Earth produced the sovereign, the sovereign governs Heaven and Earth. Heaven and Earth may change but ultimately their positions cannot be altered."

Liu Dalin knew Chen Zizhuang was grasping at straws. He said: "Duke Jing of Qi asked Confucius about government. Confucius replied: 'Let rulers be rulers, ministers ministers, fathers fathers, sons sons.' In ancient times all under heaven was primary, the ruler was secondary. All that a ruler devoted his life to managing was for all under heaven. In ancient times the people loved and honored their ruler, viewing him as a father, comparing him to Heaven—truly this was not excessive. Now the ruler is primary, all under heaven secondary. All the places under heaven where there is no peace—this is for the ruler. Before obtaining it, he slaughters the people's lives and organs, scatters the people's families, all to advance his own enterprises. He feels no remorse, saying 'I am indeed establishing a legacy for my descendants.' After obtaining it, he flays the people's bones and marrow, scatters the people's families—all to serve his personal pleasures. He considers this only proper, saying 'These are merely the interest on my property.' Now the people hate their ruler, view him as a bandit, call him a tyrant. The great harm to all under heaven is the ruler alone."

Chen Zizhuang replied righteously: "Since ancient times there have never been true followers who were not also true subjects. Since I am a Ming minister, I must prop up the falling mansion and stem the raging tide. Though ten thousand stand against me, I shall go forward."

Liu Dalin said: "Since Jisheng quotes Mencius, he should know Mencius also said: 'The people are most important; the altars of land and grain come next; the ruler is least important.' When Taizu read the *Mencius* and came to the passages about 'mere straw dogs' and 'bandits,' he said these weren't words a minister should speak and proposed removing Mencius from the shrine. He decreed that anyone who remonstrated would be charged with lèse-majesté. The great expanse under heaven—one person cannot govern it alone, so it's divided among many officials. Therefore my taking office is for the realm, not for the ruler; for the myriad people, not for one family. That later generations think officials exist to serve rulers, that rulers grant them portions of the realm to govern and people to shepherd, viewing all under heaven as a ruler's private property—this is a grave error. Now with the realm's turmoil and the people's suffering, enough to endanger the ruler—one has no choice but to discuss the arts of 'governing' and 'shepherding.' If it doesn't concern the dynasty's survival, then the realm's turmoil and people's suffering, though there be honest ministers, would be treated as trifling matters."

"You and I, Mengliang, serve different masters. We need not say more." With that, Chen Zizhuang swept his sleeves and departed.

Chen Zilü, seeing this, followed Chen Zizhuang out. The remaining men's faces were all rather unpleasant.

Though Liu Dalin had anticipated this, he hadn't expected today's gathering to truly end on such a sour note. He could only say to He Wuzhou, Yao Dian, and Zhao Xunru: "For a minister who makes light of the people's suffering in fire and flood—even if he can assist his ruler to prosperity or follow his ruler to ruin, in terms of the minister's proper way, he has still betrayed it."

He Wuzhou said: "Jisheng's nature is upright. The cataclysmic changes under heaven today are still difficult for him to accept. Mengliang should be understanding."

Liu Dalin shook his head, his heart a jumble of emotions. He sighed: "Our acquaintance is a matter of fate. This foolish younger brother leaves you these words—my elder brothers, take good care of yourselves."

With that, he took up the brush and left four characters in regular script: "Do Not Cross the River."
