# Chapter 1281 Xiao Zhanfeng

"Student Xiao Zhanfeng pays his respects to the Eastern Host." The visitor stood at the bottom of the steps and bowed deeply.

Wu Mingjin looked at the young scholar below the steps. He was wearing a green robe and a Confucian scarf, clearly a licentiate of the Great Ming. His gestures and speech all indicated that he was likely a genuine "Bachelor", not the rough-handed poor people that the *Kun* thieves liked best.

Wu Mingjin had seen scholars defecting to the *Kun* before, but most of them were child students who had studied until they were old but remained commoners. Those with actual degrees who defected were truly few and far between.

"Sir, there is no need for such formality," Wu Mingjin said politely. When Wang Zhaomin had mentioned that the *Kun* people wanted to help him "hire" a private assistant to "help with paperwork", he already knew what it was about.

Although called a private assistant, he was actually a "supervising army official". Wu Mingjin knew that going to Leizhou, and serving as an official in the *Kun* people's territory, was like Sun Wukong in the palm of the Buddha; it was better for him to be sensible and pretend to be deaf and dumb.

In fact, wasn't Wang Zhaomin beside him already a "spy" for the *Kun* people, watching him all the time? Not to mention that Head Chief Xiong had diligently prepared several servants and armed escorts for him. They all looked respectful, but secretly they werer all personal jailers.

Thinking of this, Wu Mingjin couldn't help but sigh: "Once entering the officialdom, it is as deep as the sea; from then on, integrity is a stranger." If it weren't for the sake of being this official and making a few more taels of silver to return home for retirement in the future, why would he have come to this?!

At that moment, he was all smiles and took out the letter of appointment he had prepared long ago: he wrote it himself on a large red card, with the words "Engagement Letter" written on the face. The salary was twenty-four taels per year, with an additional gift of two taels for the three festivals. A label was added to the envelope, reading "For Old Master Xiao to Keep".

Xiao Zhanfeng accepted the letter of appointment, and both sides exchanged pleasantries again. As usual, Wu Mingjin wanted to host a banquet for Master Xiao, but Xiao Zhanfeng sincerely declined.

"Since this student has accepted the Eastern Host's engagement letter, I still need to go back and settle my family affairs before I can accompany the Hall Host to assume office."

"Oh, where is Sir from?"

"This student is from Xuwen County."

That's not bad, Wu Mingjin thought. Xuwen was a subordinate county of Leizhou. Having him there would naturally make things much more convenient. The *Kun* people had put some thought into this.

"Eastern Host, please rest assured. This student will go home for a trip and will definitely return within two days. This student has already instructed someone to book a first-class ticket on Dabo Shipping."

There were scheduled boats to Guangzhou every day, but those with first-class cabins only sailed every three days. Master Wu and his party still had to stay in the private room of the Bopu Hotel for two days—Dabo Shipping had boats to Guangzhou every day, but the scheduled boats sailed once every two days.

Xiao Zhanfeng indeed rushed back to Xuwen that same day. However, he didn't go to settle any family affairs—Xiao Zhanfeng had neither parents nor a wife and children; he was a typical bachelor where "one person eats and the whole family is full".

He rushed back to Xuwen to arrange work in advance—three days ago, Xiao Zhanfeng had been appointed as the deputy station chief of the Leizhou Station of the External Intelligence Bureau. He was fully responsible for the officialdom work in Leizhou, with a focus on monitoring Wu Mingjin.

Since helping Chang Shide and Wen Tong defeat the unemployed workers who attempted to cause trouble in the sugar war three years ago, Xiao Zhanfeng gained the appreciation of Chen Tianxiong and others. However, Xiao Zhanfeng didn't have any profit considerations for doing this. After the destruction of the Haiyi Hall, although he accepted the thank-you gift of twenty taels of silver from Chen Tianxiong, he politely declined the invitation to work as a clerk in the South China Sugar Factory or the Leizhou Sugar Industry Guild.

"This student wants to study hard and at least get a green robe before considering this economic career," Xiao Zhanfeng said to Chen Tianxiong at the time. "I accept this silver with disrespect; it just happens to be used as capital for studying."

It turned out that Xiao Zhanfeng had a childhood sweetheart, his cousin, with whom he had a secret engagement. But his family had fallen into such decline, and he was a down-and-out scholar who couldn't succeed in his studies. Even if his uncle and aunt were not snobbish people, they would absolutely not marry their daughter to such a destitute pauper.

Chen Tianxiong secretly felt it was a pity. This young man had a chivalrous style and a strong thirst for knowledge. Originally, he wanted to cultivate him well, but he didn't expect that he still considered studying and passing the imperial examinations as his only option.

However, it is not a bad thing for a person to have the ambition to improve. Chen Tianxiong nodded immediately: "Since that's the case, I won't force you. If you need anything, just come to South China. My South China Sugar Factory will always have a vacant seat waiting for Sir."

The two of them enjoyed drinking under the lychee tree at Xiao Zhanfeng's home. After the wine was finished, they bid each other farewell and took care.

So Xiao Zhanfeng studied seriously without distractions and finally obtained the title of "Attached Student". Although it was the lowest rank of licentiate, he was at least wearing a green robe. Just as Xiao Zhanfeng rushed to his uncle's house excitedly to announce the good news, he received the news that his cousin was already betrothed and would be married on a chosen date.

Although the licentiate title was in hand, he was still a pauper. At most, he could go to be a teacher in a private school and barely scrape out a living. His cousin was already eighteen and could not be delayed any longer. His uncle and aunt's actions could not be called "inappropriate" by any means. Xiao Zhanfeng had unspeakable bitterness and had to return home in depression. He was drenched by heavy rain on the way and fell seriously ill upon returning home.

Xiao Zhanfeng, who had just recovered from a serious illness and was disheartened, holding hatred for the Great Ming society, finally decided to go to Chen Tianxiong and decided to "defect to the *Kun*".

"Since that's the case, why not go to the Sugar Industry Guild to be a clerk first..."

"No, Mr. Chen, I want to go to Lingao," Xiao Zhanfeng said firmly. "To study Australian learning. I heard that the Australians in Lingao run schools and teach Australian learning. I want to go there to study and seek a future under the Australians in the future."

Chen Tianxiong was greatly surprised. He had met many intellectuals of the Great Ming, and many were interested in "Australian learning", but most classified it as "ingenious skills and wicked craft". Few people delved into the whys and wherefores, and even fewer were willing to learn. He couldn't help but become a bit more cautious:

"To learn Australian learning, the South China Sugar Factory is also fine..."

"Mr. Chen, are you unwilling to let this student go to Lingao?" Xiao Zhanfeng said loudly. "How could I not know the Australians' conduct in Lingao! To tell you the truth, I won't be this Great Ming licentiate anymore—I want to go to Lingao and be a scholar of the Great Song!" Saying this, he bowed to the ground: "Please help me fulfill this wish, sir!"

So Xiao Zhanfeng handed the key to his house to Chen Tianxiong, asking him to manage it on his behalf. Bringing a few clothes, a few books, a seal, and a pair of twisted silver bracelets—a "memento" left by his parents—he boarded a sugar transport ship and arrived in Lingao. From then on, he embarked on the road of serving the Senate and the people.

Xiao Zhanfeng's defection caused a small sensation in the Senate at the time—before this, although there were a few licentiates among the naturalized citizens in Lingao, they were either victims of various natural and man-made disasters who were displaced and passively taken in, or they couldn't survive and came to Lingao to make a living just to get a bite to eat. No one with a degree had ever actively defected to Lingao. Xiao Zhanfeng was the first licentiate to come to "defect to the *Kun*" actively with such a clear-cut banner and firm stand.

After leaving the quarantine camp, Xiao Zhanfeng first entered the National School in Lingao to study—he passed the Class A diploma test—and then attended the Civil Affairs Training Class specially commissioned by the Civil Affairs People's Committee to train local administrative cadres. During his studies, Xiao Zhanfeng not only studied hard but also submitted letters to discuss affairs many times, quite seeming to want to "give directions" and "offer advice and suggestions" for the Senate. However, with the deepening of his studies and continuous "visits and studies" in various places in Lingao, Xiao Zhanfeng's letters became fewer and fewer, and finally disappeared completely—he soon realized that in terms of governing the country and managing the people, he was just displaying his slight skill before an expert.

After graduation, Xiao Zhanfeng was successively sent to serve as the village head in several villages in Lingao, then promoted to commune civil affairs assistant, and then transferred to Danzhou to serve in the Danzhou County Office. He was young and originally educated, and he grasped new knowledge and new concepts faster and more thoroughly than naturalized citizens from peasant and small merchant backgrounds. He soon became a key training object of the Civil Affairs Department, prepared to become one of the first batch of naturalized county magistrates in the future.

This transfer to Wu Mingjin's side, although mainly the intention of the Intelligence Bureau, was also considered a very good training opportunity by the Civil Affairs Department, so they readily agreed to this secondment.

Xiao Zhanfeng took a few attendants off the ship at Hai'an. He didn't return to his home in the county seat—there were neither relatives nor property at home—but went directly to the Leizhou Sugar Industry United Guild.

He reported to the person in charge here, Yan Maoda, about his upcoming work. Although the station chief of the Leizhou Station was Wen Tong, his main energy was on the sugar industry, and he didn't care much about other affairs nor did he have the energy to care. The actual person in charge became Yan Maoda, the deputy station chief and general manager of the Vietnam Trade Company. His public identity was the Chief Steward of the Leizhou Sugar Industry Guild. He secretly controlled all the forces under the Senate in the three counties of Leizhou.

"Of the three counties in Leizhou, Xuwen is the place we control most deeply," Yan Maoda introduced the situation. "Whether it's the county magistrate or the yamen runners and clerks in the three squads and six offices, we are almost at the point where orders are prohibited. Haikang and Suixi are a bit worse, but those officials and petty clerks have all been settled, and generally won't ask for trouble for themselves."

As Yan Maoda spoke, he asked someone to take a thick file box from the filing cabinet:

"This is the material I copied for you according to the notice from the Intelligence Bureau. It contains personal and family information of all officials, clerks, gentry, and prominent families in office in the one prefecture and three counties of Leizhou. There is also an overview of the basic conditions of the whole county, including farmers, population, production, etc."

"Thank you so much, Chief!" Xiao Zhanfeng greatly appreciated the Australian style of doing things where everything was clear down to the smallest detail. In his long-term administrative practice, he had long realized the critical nature of intelligence information—it could be said that the Australians' ability to conquer every obstacle in various thorny affairs had a great relationship with their ability to grasp and transmit various kinds of intelligence at any time.

"Haha, you are too polite. Wu Mingjin is just a cover; you need to work hard." Yan Maoda said with a smile.
