# Chapter 108 - Mobilizing the Masses (4)

While they were busy, they saw a ship sailing towards them from the sea in the distance, cleaving through the waves. The unique silhouette of the ship allowed the lookout post to recognize at a glance that it was the Transmigrators' Type 67 landing craft. Since entering the port, this ship had not moved again—fearing the consumption of fuel.

The salt workers on the beach were thrown into panic, dropping their tools and running towards the village in chaos—the sea was not peaceful in these times. Every ship coming from the sea could be an enemy.

Zhang Xingjiao, having seen much of the world, led the Tan father and son at the village entrance to calm everyone down—this is the ship of those Short-haired Masters, it's fine.

The transmigrators were very happy. This was the first time in more than two months that they saw their own ship sailing on the sea. The Executive Committee dispatched a ship that was not easily used, which showed the importance attached to this mission—no one wanted to work in an unvalued position.

Xi Yazhou raised his arm: "Let's go, everyone go to the beach to welcome the navy!"

"Navy!" Everyone laughed, feeling quite proud. Isn't the most advanced navy in this time and space them?

Just then, the landing craft let out a passionate long whistle. Before the sound of the steam whistle faded, it had emerged from the long waves and was sailing towards the coast to meet them.

Those without duties walked towards the beach together, followed by dozens of curious children and villagers.

The landing craft had a deep draft and couldn't get too close. Xi Yazhou turned on the walkie-talkie and communicated with the other side, learning that besides transporting the grain, cloth, and weapons requested by the work team yesterday, this ship also brought a batch of daily necessities and construction materials.

"Find us a berth with a draft of 1.2-1.5 meters, so we can beach and unload the cargo." Chen Haiyang called on the walkie-talkie.

"Okay, wait a moment!"

The west coast of Hainan Island is dominated by rocky coastlines. Except for the mudflats formed by sediment accumulation in the bays, small rocky bays could be said to be everywhere. Soon, a small bay was found not far away. The water surface was very small, barely able to accommodate two or three fishing boats.

The landing craft, running on slow speed, slowly sailed into the bay. This landing craft, renovated before the crossing, looked beautiful and majestic at this time. A new unloading derrick was installed on the ship. The two machine gun positions on the superstructure each had a military crew member holding an SKS rifle, wearing an 80-style helmet and an orange life jacket, looking heroic, very much like the PLA in another time and space—if only there were a machine gun each. Xi Yazhou was letting his imagination run wild. Seeing everyone coming to welcome them, they were all smiles, waving to the welcoming crowd on the shore.

The engine motor roared one last time, let out a long breath, and stopped.

The landing craft beached and lowered the ramp. A burly man walked down from the ship. He had a round face, big eyes, and a tall and strong physique. The children who followed were scared speechless. A person with a height of 190 cm and a weight of 110 kg was simply a giant to the people of that time. This strong man was Chen Haiyang of the military group, wearing his own navy blue training uniform, full of energy.

Chen Haiyang led four military crew members to walk up to Xi Yazhou, lined up in a row, and saluted:

"Report, Chen Haiyang, captain of the Navy's Wuzhishan boat, ordered to escort the cargo here. I now listen to your command."

"Organize unloading immediately!" Xi Yazhou returned the salute while smiling, "Let the masses see what you have brought them!"

"Yes! Organize unloading immediately."

After shaking hands with Chen Haiyang and others to thank them, Xi Yazhou opened the written document given to him by the Executive Committee. He laughed as he read:

"Great! Great! This really solves the problem."

He said excitedly to Zhang Xingjiao: "Tell Uncle Tan to gather the villagers and prepare to unload!"

As the villagers slowly gathered around, Xi Yazhou climbed up the superstructure and stood high, with hundreds of eyes staring at him:

"Fellow villagers!" Xi Yazhou smiled and waved the hand holding the document, "From Bairen City, food and clothes have been sent to us. Temporarily allocate one thousand jin of rice to the village! This rice costs nothing, all distributed to everyone!"

There was a moment of incredible silence in the whole field, followed by a burst of cheers after a while. Zhang Xingjiao had already gathered some young people through the Tan father and son last night and taught them to cheer on signal. Some elderly people and women looked at the ship full of grain and rice, shedding tears. The cheers gradually lowered, replaced by the grateful tears of the masses.

Xi Yazhou continued in the silence that had just settled: "There are also fifty bolts of cloth, all used to make clothes for everyone. This requires the women in the village to help! However, the fabric is not enough yet. The clothes made may only be one piece per family, but there will be more later—"

Before Zhang Xingjiao finished translating, another burst of cheers erupted from the crowd.

"Fellow villagers!" Xi Yazhou put away the document, "Our life depends on labor, not solely on relief. Now Bairen City needs a large amount of sea salt. Everyone exert your strength to produce for yourselves. We want as much sea salt as there is!"

"We have plenty of strength. As for salt, we have as much as you want!" Led by the Tan father and son and several people around, the masses were incited to enthusiasm.

Seeing the heated atmosphere, Zhang Xingjiao hurriedly stood out as arranged by Chief Xi: "Fellow villagers! I, Zhang Xingjiao, am also a local native and have studied for a few years. In the past, my property and fields were forcibly seized by Great Household Gou, and finally, even my ancestral grave was dug by him. I was bullied so much that I couldn't live..." When he spoke of the painful parts, he constantly wiped his eyes with his sleeve, and the masses below also sighed and sobbed along with him, "Great Household Gou caused my family to be broken and people dead, caused everyone to have no clothes or food," he wiped his eyes and shouted with a hoarse throat, "The Short-haired Masters came, gave us food and clothes, helped us produce. Whoever comes to chatter again, whoever comes to take our benefits again—"

"Does this need saying!" The young people roared, "If that son of a bitch Great Household Gou comes again, we'll smash his dog head!"

The older people looked somewhat afraid, but now the atmosphere had been incited, and they didn't dare to openly say anything discouraging.

"Correct!" Xi Yazhou shouted excitedly, "This salt field is approved by the imperial court, a place made by everyone's ancestors carrying water and scooping salt bit by bit. By what right does Great Household Gou occupy it to get rich? Everyone must protect the salt, protect the grain and rice, protect our homes, protect the fruits of our labor!"

The emotions of the masses were extremely high. Du Wen, standing aside, was smiling excitedly at first, but then frowned. In this speech, Xi Yazhou left a foreshadowing, not saying words like the salt field belonged to the people—according to the Executive Committee's idea, this salt field would be the property of the transmigrators in the future.

Amidst the noise of the masses, Xi Yazhou walked down from the superstructure of the landing craft with satisfaction. Bundles of weapons had been unloaded onto the ground. These were all weapons captured in the Battle of Bairen Beach, now renovated.

Besides grain and cloth, the landing craft also brought red bricks, cement, and some tables, chairs, and benches newly produced by the Bopu Wood Processing Factory to the work team—because the personnel of the machinery group had nothing to do temporarily, they used the wood processing equipment of the wood processing factory to make some modern-style furniture for everyone to use.

The camp of the work team was also renovated. With construction materials and under the guidance of professional personnel from the construction group who came with the ship, everyone worked together and soon completed a blockhouse-style building. There were also several reasonably comfortable tiled houses around. The 15W radio station brought along also added a new antenna transmission tower. Outside the wall, Xi Yazhou asked the construction group to build a screen wall as a bulletin board.

That day, under the chairmanship of Xi Yazhou, a villagers' committee was established, with a production team and a militia team under it. At Du Wen's suggestion, a women's group was also established—rural women in Hainan all worked in the fields and were known for doing heavy and hard work, so the ethical codes of separation between men and women had little market here.

The militia team was led by Tan Chengqing. Zhang Xingjiao wrote a petition to the county government, generally stating that because the village was repeatedly harassed by pirates, village braves were established to protect the village. This kind of legal procedure was still necessary.

The militia team consisted of sixty able-bodied men. The salt workers knew some martial arts more or less. After getting weapons, everyone's enthusiasm was very high, taking time to train in the early morning and evening. Swords dancing and spears flying, it was very lively. Xi Yazhou watched from the side but felt that although these things had some power in single combat, they probably wouldn't work in real formation combat. During the Battle of Bairen Beach, Xi Yazhou had seen the attack of the Huang Family Stockade village braves: the momentum was fierce and very organized. If such a team attacked, the disorganized and undisciplined militia would probably collapse at the first touch.

Xi Yazhou had a set of insights on recruit education, but these militia used broadswords and long spears. He wasn't sure if it was appropriate to rashly use recruit education from the firearm era.

"If only we could equip them with firearms!" Xi Yazhou returned to the command post after watching their drill. The people brought by Chen Haiyang stayed in the camp—they were waiting for the salt workers to gather thirty tons of salt. Once the salt was gathered, they would take the salt and Tan Guihuang across the sea to Leizhou to open up sales channels for the salt.

"Firearms can't be produced in a short time," Chen Haiyang thought for a while, "We can practice formation and physical fitness first. These two areas are useful in the army of any era."

"One must be politically reliable first before being militarily tough!" Du Wen suddenly popped up from somewhere. She was currently throwing herself wholeheartedly into organizing the women's group, staying with Tan Xiaoqin every day to learn the local dialect, "Our organization is still floating on the surface."

These words stunned the people present. Indeed, the enthusiasm of the salt workers had been incited now, but they couldn't be called politically reliable at this time; they became allies of the transmigrators only because of the trend of the times. The firmness of their stance still had to be questioned.

Xi Yazhou pondered for a moment and said: "Currently, the first thing is to establish the organization. The village committee and militia have been established, but it doesn't count as taking root in the salt field. We must cultivate activists among the salt workers and develop a group of people who share weal and woe with us. Only in this way can we be considered to have taken root in the salt field. We need to promote cadres from the salt workers successively."

Everyone agreed with Xi Yazhou's view. Du Wen said: "I want to run a training class—let's call it Maniao Peasant Training Institute. Train some salt workers and cultivate a backbone force. I will be the main lecturer. What do you think?"

This view happened to coincide with Wang Luobin's idea. However, Xi Yazhou didn't want Du Wen to lecture on political theories. He said: "Good, the name Training Institute is not bad. It just happens that Engineer Wang also has the idea of running a technical training class. You two do this thing together. Start with literacy and learning to speak Mandarin! We all have to set aside some time to lecture."
