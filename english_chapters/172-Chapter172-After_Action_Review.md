# Chapter 172: After-Action Review

On the village beach—inside the headquarters tent—Baitu expedition's squad-and-above officers, NCOs, and cadets gathered. Medical team nurses poured tea. Everyone was pleased: despite minor embarrassment, battle followed textbook procedures perfectly. Zero casualties.

"We must develop a habit—post-action review after every operation. Speak freely—no taboos."

Native NCOs naturally wouldn't speak—their hierarchy consciousness was still strong. Xi Yazhou didn't force it: everything takes time.

"Bivouac and sentry arrangements satisfactory?"

"All arranged."

"First large-unit combined operation. Many problems. When enemy cannon fired—all platoons wavered. Lucky enemy cannon was garbage—otherwise if they'd hit someone, we'd have had total collapse."

"No veterans—all newbies."

"Need more under-fire adaptation training. Get them accustomed to explosions."

"Key is more combat experience—"

"Combat will come. But current state—90% chance of breaking at first contact. Running is still good—worse is paralysis waiting to die! Those 1st Company soldiers burying faces in dirt—really embarrassing. Playing ostrich?" Xi Yazhou's criticism was brutal.

Wei Aiwen's face reddened. As 1st Company Commander—and Reference Company with 60%+ excellence rates—biggest embarrassment was his company.

"Returning—I'll strictly rectify!" Wei Aiwen's tone was low. "Those showing cowardice—all removed to logistics."

"First-time combat—fear is understandable. Removing them—how to replace? Retrain from scratch."

"I also think unnecessary." Xi Yazhou said. "If unit's weak—commanders find reasons in themselves, not blame soldiers!"

Wei Aiwen felt like sitting on fire—this had become a struggle session. He stood: "I'll make deep self-criticism—"

"Forget it, Little Wei, relax." Others pulled him down.

"Skip self-criticism. Returning—everyone submit new training plans and methods. Improve quickly. Also you platoon commanders—don't think your men passed. No embarrassment was luck—doesn't mean strong troops."

Old Tiger You and others grimaced assent. Post-battle reviews weren't pleasant.

"Also shooting. Checkpoint battle—volleys very ragged. 200m—three platoons firing—only a dozen hits? With Minié rifles—this score's unacceptable!"

"Soldiers don't grasp elevation sights well—many aren't accustomed—"

"Returning—emphasize sight-adjustment shooting. Otherwise against cavalry—we're dead."

Huang Xiong marveled: these bald people's military style was truly different. Winning battles didn't mean rewards and banquets—instead nitpicking everything. Can such leadership inspire men to fight and die?

Huang Xiong didn't deny this new army's many shocks—especially weapons, arguably peerlessly sharp. But military philosophy and methods seemed childishly naive. Probably overseas barbarian thinking differed from Chinese.

"12-pounder mountain howitzers exceeded expectations. Drawback: insufficient ammunition. Low-intensity combat was barely enough. Unit mechanization is low—but establishment is mechanized standard. Soldiers besides weapons and gear also carry artillery equipment—too exhausting. Without village liaisons as porters, many soldiers would've straggled." Ying Yu summarized artillery.

"Mechanization shortage can't be solved quickly." Wen Desi said. "Raising or buying horses isn't overnight—Hainan isn't horse country."

"I know—Wu Nanhai can't conjure horses." Ying Yu said. "My suggestion: with few horses, expand artillery personnel—"

"Damn—substituting men for beasts?"

"That's the idea."

Transmigrators exchanged glances. This was the most despised old-army system—even more despised than Bannermen slavery, by 100 times.

"I know it's terrible—but how else ensure gun mobility?"

No alternatives. Unless emergency horse buying. Guangzhou horse purchasing was difficult—officials investigated closely, markets had few horses.

"Adding gunners makes sense." Xi Yazhou avoided saying "substituting men for beasts." "Currently each 12-pounder has 6 gunners. Increasing to 10—reduces individual burden. Also adds firepower."

"Best—develop lighter, shorter weapons for artillery—easier carrying. Maybe carbines."

"But enemies might overrun artillery positions. All short weapons inappropriate."

"6 gunners use short weapons; add 4 standard riflemen."

"This proposal works." Ying Yu agreed.

"Also—our ration standards have problems. Theoretically 0.75kg/day—actually many eat 1.5kg. This undermines standards. Need revision."

"Fat and protein deficient diet causes this." Dongmen Chuiyu—as Agriculture's ration observer—said helplessly.

"Any feedback on Grassland Plan rations?"

Wei Aiwen started speaking—but Xi Yazhou interrupted—calling on distracted Tian Liang.

"Tian Liang—tell us: how's past two days' food?"

Tian Liang hadn't expected—reflexively stood, saluted.

"Reporting, Chief!"

"Don't shout. Just tell us."

"Very—good." He swallowed. This was honest: eating full, fine grain—what dissatisfaction?

"Sit. Soldiers all say this?" Xi Yazhou surveyed.

Everyone nodded. One squad leader smiled embarrassedly, stood:

"Reporting, Chief—brothers said if there's meat—even better."

Laughter. Atmosphere lightened.

"Wanting meat is good. Currently difficult—when we're richer, brothers will eat meat daily!" Xi Yazhou wrote a blank check.

"Really? Chief... Xi?" Squad leader was excitedly stunned. Huang Xiong was secretly amused: trusting officers' words? Sun rises from the west. Soldiers eating meat daily—where's such good fortune?

"Of course." Xi Yazhou nodded, seating him. "Soldiers probably have no complaints. Officers?"

"No fat!"

"Grassland-1 and -2 are good. -3 and -4 are bland. Without luncheon meat—can't eat."

"Best make oil jars like fish sauce. Add some when cooking."

"Too few vegetables. Eating like this—eventually stomach fire!"

Much food feedback—but not as intense as expected. Because they hadn't tried Grassland-5—instant rice cakes. Dongmen Chuiyu had eaten one—taste was horrifying.

After the meeting—village elders were brought to headquarters tent, kneeling, then helped up by Wen Desi.

Transmigrators needed Baitu's people and property. But forcibly relocating 500+ from comfortable homes to a strange place—resistance was obvious. After Wen Desi's arrival, officers agreed: more work on leadership to pacify commoners. Avoid violent incidents during transit.

Three entering elders: two were village major surnames—both Fujianese. One surnamed Lin, carpenter. Another surnamed Lu, blacksmith. Both brought entire clans—village's dominant power. Last was a Cantonese surnamed Zhang—shipwright—came only with wife and children.

Lin clan built ships—but mediocre skill, only small boats. Shipwright Zhang was the core technician. Best-selling 400-*liao* ships—only Zhang could build. Knowing his minority and outsider status, Zhang kept shipbuilding secrets—no apprentices. Crucial work like lofting—done personally. Others just labored, didn't understand principles.

Village residents—besides Lin and Lu clans—mostly were landless farmers and craftsmen escaping Guangdong and Fujian. Real power was in Lin and Lu hands. Shipwright Zhang's technical value gave him voice. After touring and interrogating ordinary villagers, Wen Desi understood: most villagers were exploited. Workshops, tools, ships... all production facilities belonged to Lin and Lu families.

Understanding this—Wen Desi planned dismantling them. Shipwright Zhang was clearly easiest to split off.

Wen Desi spoke reassuringly: all property would just relocate to Bopu. Private property would be protected. At Bopu—they'd continue shipbuilding under transmigrator protection—all labor would be paid. Housing and grain supply would be arranged.

They obviously didn't believe—but belief wasn't necessary. Wen Desi just needed to reduce hostility.
