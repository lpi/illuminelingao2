# Chapter 2281: New Noble

Yi Haoran having obtained this title, handled matters with proper name and smooth words.

The purpose of offering incense was to see Cai Lan; for Yi Haoran this "Deity" was much harder to invite. So decided on his own, setting on July 6th.

Ding A-tao didn't have much housework to manage; a few days earlier or later were all okay. So settled on this day.

Yi Haoran immediately went out of city, arriving at Dragon Mother Temple, coming to temple to find Abbot.

Dragon Mother Temple’s Abbot name was Wu Yuan, age not big, but in Wuzhou was long sleeves good at dancing, having relationships with local aristocratic families and big households. Originally medium and small merchants like Luo Yangming were not in his eyes at all; coming to temple to offer incense having a guest prefect to receive could be counted as giving face.

Now Luo Yangming was a ringing real power figure in Wuzhou, so when Yi Haoran arrived at Dragon Mother Temple, once handing over name card, Abbot Wu Yuan welcomed out personally. After some exchange of pleasantries, Yi Haoran explained intention: saying Luo Yangming’s wife and concubine wanted to come to Dragon Mother Temple to offer incense on July 6th, hoping to arrange a quiet room in backyard in advance, ordering a table of vegetarian meal.

Abbot Wu Yuan heard, white clean face revealed difficult expression.

"What, have difficulty?" Yi Haoran chased asking.

"Master Luo’s matter, small temple originally dare not reject, just this date not coincidental." Abbot Wu Yuan frowned, "Yesterday someone also came to book..."

"In your Dragon Mother Temple backyard, quiet rooms shouldn't be only one, right?"

"That of course not only." Abbot Wu Yuan hurriedly said, "Just this guest background very big."

"Oh? Don't know which Master’s family?"

"Not which Master’s family..." Abbot lowered voice saying, "Booked by Australian, is female dependent."

Yi Haoran thought in heart this must be Cai Lan! Qiuchan indeed capable! He smiled slightly, saying: "Abbot, my Master works right in Aftermath Bureau; True Australian in this Wuzhou is only Crefect Xie alone. And he has no female dependent accompanying to post. Female dependent you say, probably is that..." He said pointing to direction of temple gate, "...That one, right?"

Cai Lan assassinating at Dragon Mother Temple gate caused sensory in Wuzhou at that time. Later "losing chastity following thieves" became even more a news in Wuzhou. Added oil and vinegar by people, derived very unbearably. Whenever someone mentioned this matter, mostly was disdain.

Disdain was disdain, Cai Lan now was "True Hair's Woman"—discussing what end power holder's woman would have, common people were still clear. Therefore Abbot Wu Yuan spoke specifically lowering voice; Yi Haoran used "That one" to refer.

Abbot Wu Yuan nodded.

"Since it is her then easy to handle." Yi Haoran said, "Speaking of it, this one has no title, neither wife nor concubine, neither slave nor maid, why must Abbot honor her so? Masters of this Wuzhou city knowing, wouldn't they sneer!"

Wu Yuan was somewhat surprised: this speech was spoken so viciously. If changed to other person, he would hurry to pretend confusion to "send guest." But behind this Mr. Yi was "Aftermath Bureau’s" Master Luo—Number One Red Man under True Hair! Not to mention status was more noble than this Cai Lan, moreover his advisor publicly spoke such words...

He remembered again person coming to notify this time was not some important cadre under Australian, only a small clerk and Cai Lan’s "Accompanying Woman," nor requested security clearance. Visible this True Hair's favor for her had declined.

Wu Yuan was a person with exquisite heart, thoughts turning extremely fast, immediately smiled: "Since Master Luo’s dependents favor small temple so, small Daoist cannot decline either. Like this, how about settling on that quiet room at east end? As for this vegetarian meal..."

"Abbot just handle as seeing fit, need not be frugal." Yi Haoran smiled, "Master Luo’s dependents are also people understanding reason, absolutely won't give difficulty to Abbot." Yi Haoran had been to Dragon Mother Temple backyard. Knew terrain inside: three main rooms were for Cai Lan them; quiet room at east end Wu Yuan mentioned was three wing rooms. Environment quiet and hidden, a good place for private talk.

"This is easy." Abbot Wu Yuan agreed fully, "Originally in summer heat, inner dependents coming to temple to offer incense are few. Sir saying so naturally need to handle with whole heart."

Arriving at July 6th this day, weather sunny and hot with few clouds. Yi Haoran got up very early, finished washing quickly ate breakfast, then went to sedan chair shop on street calling two bamboo silk cool sedan chairs, carried to courtyard waiting.

He was anxious in heart, fearing missing Cai Lan; although knowing time was still early, still looked at inner residence gate from time to time.

This anxiety was seen by A-Chun. "Advisor," he joked, "I see you old man's thought of going to Dragon Mother Temple is bigger than Mistress and Concubine!"

Yi Haoran realized he lost composure, hurriedly defended: "Where, this weather hot, we go out earlier, road is cooler. If sun comes up, walking all way is both steaming and drying."

"Master need not be anxious." A-Chun said, "Mistress and Concubine got up early, just now already sent breakfast, now probably combing and washing—probably taking quite some time. Mistress said, now our family counts as half a gentry household too, going out to worship god is big matter, can't be too sloppy."

As Australians advanced singing song in Guangdong, although Ding A-tao had quite some complaints about husband putting energy in Aftermath Bureau, yet gradually felt her status was "not ordinary."

Luo Yangming was one of "Head and Face Figures" in Wuzhou city right now; no matter how prominent the gentry family, even if head ran away, as long as property and family dependents remained in Wuzhou, during festivals they inevitably sent people to door sending a name card, a gift. This kind of respect was what Ding A-tao lived half a life never enjoying.

Going out to offer incense was almost the only opportunity for women at that time to appear in public openly, also opportunity for big household women to show off family background, status and wealth. Ding A-tao was from small door small household background; at best time was just rice shop boss's wife, not yet counting as outstanding among Wuzhou city merchants, so dared not think about this kind of thing; going out to burn incense was all quiet.

So this time she had heart to take this opportunity to show off a bit. Even A-Chun today also changed into a body of cyan cloth short shirt, even hair net changed to brand new.

Yi Haoran waited for half a shichen (hour), then saw two people come out, from head to foot all newly purchased; not only materials exquisite, patterns also belonged to gorgeous. Compared to plain clothes and light makeup usually, simply like two different people.

A-Chun was even more stunned, blurting out:

"Mistress, you suddenly became so beautiful!"

Ding A-tao after all from small household background, praised by this child, instantly cheeks flew red, saying: "Since wanting to offer incense, inevitably have to do some scene."

Yi Haoran hurriedly joined in fun: "Mistress says right! Now Master status noble, Mistress going out can't be too shabby; sweeping Master’s face would not be beautiful."

Ding A-tao felt this Advisor Yi not only handled affairs capably, speaking was also pleasant to hear, couldn't help smiling slightly, saying: "Today have to trouble Sir."

Tone was both slow and unhurried, revealing an air of calm and composed of gentry mistress, different from usual too.

Yi Haoran busy said: "Mistress speaks heavily." Saying he bowed: "Sedan chairs already waiting in yard, please Mistress and Concubine get on sedan."

Two people got on sedan chairs, Yi Haoran led way in front, A-Chun followed behind. Speaking of it this Luo family back residence was quite shabby, besides a rough work old maid, Ding A-tao had no other slave maids beside her; many things in inner residence were done by her and Wen Yun themselves. So this procession going out to burn incense could only be simplified. Only called a partner in rice shop, carrying load of offerings to follow.

Group went out of house gate, coming all the way along Gui River bank. Ding A-tao went out extremely rarely usually; counting up in a year only seven or eight times. After Australians captured Wuzhou, because she worried current situation unstable, going out would attract disaster, even more didn't step out of door. Husband said Australians had talent of governance; she wanted to take a good look at this new scene of Wuzhou.

Through fine bamboo curtain hanging on cool sedan window, saw outside streets flat, tidy and clean, indeed different from past days. Pedestrians on street not many, steps hurried, each seeking livelihood, no abnormality. However, walking this way, didn't see beggars and refugees—originally everywhere on road, now trace completely gone.

Looks like Australians indeed had some ability. Ding A-tao thought, if they could split earth to be King in Two Guangs, own husband following them, inevitably would count as gentry class figure. If really like husband said, Australians wanted to chase deer in Central Plains, uniting under heaven, then Luo Yangming would be merit subject following dragon, she inevitably would have a Mandated Title...

However worry quickly shrouded in her heart again; now rice shop business not good, merchants in city all said business hard to do, market desolate. Walking all the way she indeed saw although shops all opened doors, all were a half dead appearance; neither traveling merchants coming and going, nor street running gentlemen attracting business everywhere matching deals...

Thinking again Luo Yangming almost didn't come home these few months, her mood dropped again. All said Dragon Mother was most efficacious; only begging her to bless Australians fighting more victorious battles, Luo Yangming could also attach to steed tail thousand *li*, earning a good future—finally, absolutely don't deny her this wife of chaff and bran after getting rich and noble...

She thought wildly all the way, didn't know how long passed, suddenly sedan chair stopped. Came Yi Haoran’s voice: "Mistress, Dragon Mother Temple arrived."

Ding A-tao got off sedan, seeing already before Dragon Mother Temple steps. Although living in Wuzhou for a few years, times she went to Dragon Mother Temple were countable on fingers. Instead Wen Yun often went—her brother was foreman of porters on dock, also person eating water rice, belief in Dragon Mother was much more reverent than ordinary people.

Yi Haoran sent away sedan chairs, leading way in front. Ascending steps was a stone archway, right in middle was "Imperially Bestowed Lady Yongning" several big characters; Ding A-tao heard people say, this was bestowed by Taizu of this Dynasty.

Passing archway, was Main Hall. Weather hot, people coming to Dragon Mother Temple to offer incense not many. However once Ding A-tao appeared, immediately attracted quite a few sight lines, but quite a few confused looks. Ding A-tao suddenly remembered, she was dressed as rich family mistress, yet beside her no slave girls and old maids crowding around.
