# Chapter 70: Master Huang

Wu Mingjin's face fell. He was deeply moved. He knew this Master Huang, ever public-spirited, had led clansmen and militia to fight bandits whenever there were local threats—already losing several close nephews and cousins. He hadn't expected this time to cost even a son.

"Please accept my condolences, Elder. After the pirates retreat, this student will certainly report to superiors and request posthumous honors for your son." Though Master Huang had no scholarly status, his son was a county-school student. Magistrate Wu, deliberately elevating him, usually addressed him as "Elder."

"My foolish son died pacifying the region. Our Huang family has long received the nation's grace; we must repay court and homeland even if ground to powder. We don't covet these posthumous honors." Huang Shoutong didn't want to dwell on his son—though he had three sons, this one was a concubine's child without scholarly status. Yet losing a son still felt like his heart was tearing.

"Shoutong comes to warn Your Honor." He spoke directly. "These pirates are unlike any before. Great disaster awaits Lingao!"

"Elder, what do you mean?" Wu Mingjin was shocked. He knew this old man was calm and steady—not one for empty boasts.

Huang Shoutong described yesterday's events: his son had led a dozen-odd militia to ambush three pirate scouts near Bairrentou Beach. Though he hadn't participated, the survivors' accounts alarmed him. The initial arrow volley felled only one; though the old saying went "three arrows aren't worth one blade," and the militia's bows were poor—the opponents wore no armor, yet two big men took seven or eight arrows each and still fought their way through, killing several, including his son.

He closed his eyes, recalling his son's corpse when the militia brought it back—half the face nearly shattered, an eye missing. From the militia's account: this person, despite multiple arrows and being surrounded, killed his son—who'd loved martial arts since childhood—in a single exchange. Such a man would be a rare fierce general even in the regular army.

Individual valor alone didn't overly concern him. But another item the militia brought back did.

"The pirates' firearms are extremely formidable. One of them used a small hand-cannon, killing several men—without even loading powder or shot. Please see, Your Honor—" He handed over a cloth bundle. Wu Mingjin unwrapped it: inside was a blueish-black piece of iron, very compact. The style vaguely resembled European hand-cannons but with clean, simple lines—no visible matchlock mechanism.

"This is a hand-cannon?"

"Indeed." Seeing the magistrate's puzzlement, Huang Shoutong said the militia had found it on the battlefield afterward—apparently dropped by a pirate in the melee.

"Is the militia's account reliable?" The magistrate was still skeptical. Though a scholar, in recent decades literati had become fond of discussing military matters and firearms. He hadn't seen all types of fire-cannon in person, but he'd seen illustrations in books. This thing resembled no cannon—except for a barrel and trigger.

*(Note: Late Ming saw a surge of firearms discourse among intellectuals. Most were armchair strategists. Song Yingxing criticized this trend in* Tiangong Kaiwu.*)*

"Reliable. This weapon requires no powder-loading. Pull the trigger and it fires." Huang Shoutong stroked his beard. "After bringing it back, I test-fired one shot. Considerable power—penetrated thick wooden boards at five *zhang*. But a second pull didn't fire. It must pre-store multiple charges internally; each trigger pull fires one."

"That's truly a formidable weapon." Wu Mingjin stared at this small blueish-black object, deeply worried. If the pirates had many such cannons, how could militia archers resist in open battle? Defending with cannon from the walls seemed the only strategy.

"I've come to the county for two reasons: first, to warn; second, to request some weapons."

As commander of the six-village mutual-defense alliance, he had several hundred able men but scarce weapons. Besides leaders and some retainers with blades and spears, ordinary militia had only wooden poles. Lingao had always lacked iron; weapons were even scarcer. His family's retainers used blades and spears passed down from ancestors generations ago. They had many bows, but Hainan's climate was poor for archery—the bows weren't reliable.

Wu Mingjin couldn't refuse. From the armory he allocated: twenty waist-sabers, ten shield-boards, forty tiger-forks, five iron spears. Plus some gunpowder and shot—the Huang family fortress had some iron cannons and blunderbusses, but gunpowder was a government monopoly, difficult to obtain.

As Huang Shoutong was about to take his leave to rest, a runner reported: the scouts sent out this morning had returned. Since the pirates landed, the county sent daily scouts to gather intelligence—all locals familiar with roads and terrain.

The gates couldn't be opened; a prepared large basket was lowered to haul people up the walls. Scouts went out daily without incident, but today's group returned in great alarm. Citizens on the walls buzzed with speculation.

"What—road-building?" The magistrate asked in shock.

"Yes, Your Honor." The scout knelt, stealing a glance at the magistrate.

"From Bopu toward Bairrentou Beach. Markers all along the way. The pirates heap soil into road. Already built five or six *li*."

"Five or six *li*—you're not mistaken?!" Huang Shoutong surged forward, demanding.

"I'm not mistaken." The scout fearfully looked at this famous figure.

Huang Shoutong was astonished. He turned and bowed: "Your Honor, our village militia fought yesterday. On the way, there was no road yet..."

Wu Mingjin nodded, speaking solemnly: "The road-building you witnessed—nothing exaggerated? If there's the slightest falsehood, you won't be spared!"

The scout kowtowed repeatedly: "I dare not deceive Your Honor. Indeed, five or six *li* of road completed." He added that the pirates had sorcery: carts without wheels that moved, with giant iron arms that could scoop soil with massive blades. Mountains of dirt were effortlessly excavated and moved...

*Sorcery again!* The magistrate didn't believe in supernatural explanations, but things beyond his understanding kept accumulating—pirates' capabilities kept growing. This was truly worrying. Take road-building: he'd considered repairing bridges and roads in the county, but various obstacles always intervened. Either lacking funds to mobilize laborers, or landlords quarreling, refusing to cede land. Even with everything smooth, he couldn't possibly build five or six *li* of highway in two days—let alone by heaping soil. What kind of people were these pirates?

But the current problem wasn't the road itself—it was *why* the pirates were building it. Being bandits, they couldn't be earning merit. Their goal was plunder—this was unnecessary. Besides, what was there to plunder at Bairrentou Beach? Just a few stonemason families, likely already fled.

In his uncertainty, he quickly summoned yamen officials, Jinshi Liu Dalin, and the reinforcement Captain to discuss countermeasures. After hearing from the scout and Master Huang, the hall of officials and gentry fell silent. Originally, they'd assumed that however bad a pirate landing might be, at worst they'd plunder commoners and burn some villages and markets. Since the Song Dynasty, neither Li-people uprisings nor pirate raids had ever taken this county. Some were even relieved the pirates landed after mid-autumn—if it had been before winter when the autumn grain was ready, losses would have been far worse. But bad news kept coming: first, scouts reported the pirates had established a large camp at Bopu, unloading cargo day and night. Then the famously fierce Huang family militia was routed. Now the pirates were building roads. No one could figure out what these shaven-headed bandits intended.

Wu Mingjin looked to his trusted advisor, Liu Dalin: "Elder, what do you think?"

The *jinshi* propped his head with one hand. After a long pause: "Your Honor, this bodes great peril."

Both Magistrate Wu and Vice-Magistrate Wu startled. The magistrate quickly bowed: "Please enlighten me, Elder."

"I fear these shaven-headed pirates intend to attack the city!"

"How so?"

"Mountain and sea bandits travel light for raids. Why build roads? If building roads, the only explanation is intent to attack the city. I believe the pirates must have siege equipment—extremely heavy—requiring roads to transport to the walls."

Siege equipment so heavy it needed roads—how massive must it be? The whole hall fell silent. Wu Mingjin's voice trembled: "Could it be... the Red-Barbarian Cannon..."

"No other explanation."

Hainan was near Guangdong and Macau; European ships occasionally passed. The court purchasing cannons from the Europeans in Guangzhou was known in official circles. Wu Mingjin knew these cannons were extremely heavy but devastatingly powerful—the court used them in Liaodong defense. Last year, Guangning's siege was held thanks to these cannons—truly military treasures.

If such a weapon were dragged to the city walls—the magistrate dared not imagine the consequences.

"What can be done? This is just a small county." Vice-Magistrate Wu had already cried out in alarm. His unspoken implication was clear to all present: what did this remote small county have that was worth such massive pirate effort? What sin had Lingao committed to attract such devastating weaponry?

They didn't yet know they faced something even more terrifying than Red-Barbarian Cannons. As storytellers in Lingao's teahouses would later say: "Tragedy!"

All eyes turned to Captain Sun in his mandarin-duck coat. This hereditary centurion had originally thought this was a cushy assignment. Upon arriving, he'd collected ten taels of silver as a reward; he'd skimmed half the soldiers' bonuses too. These two days meant wine and meat every meal—far more comfortable than the half-dead garrison life. As for pirates attacking the city—he thought that impossible.

Now seeing the whole hall staring at him, he panicked. He knew well that despite his hereditary centurion title, he was really just a small landlord. The thirty soldiers he'd brought spent more time holding hoes than weapons. Their only real asset was one Frankish cannon. How could he produce a strategy? Besides, if the pirates truly dragged Red-Barbarian Cannons here, he'd be too busy fleeing. Knowing anything he said would be wrong, he simply feigned composure and said nothing.

Magistrate Wu silently cursed Captain Sun as useless—but he'd never expected garrison troops to accomplish much anyway. This matter would likely require requesting General Tang to send troops.

"The only current strategy is harassment," said Liu Dalin. "The shaven-headed pirates building roads can't always stay clustered together. We send more militia, offer heavy rewards—harass with arrows, seize chances to set fires, disrupt them day and night. That should obstruct their road-building."
