# Chapter 1 - Chang Shide's Defense Against His Accusations

Chapter 1 Chang Shide's Defense Against His Accusations
Author: Gain Not Worth Loss (Idiot Crowd)

Since this is a questioning session, at least the accused object must be allowed to answer questions.

I, the defendant Chang Shide, express my objection to the accused charges. And defend as follows:

1. The danger of doing business abroad. This point needs no elaboration.

2. Going deep into the locals.

Merchants who went out to do business in the Ming Dynasty traveled north and south, and often spent money all the way. Even in the unhygienic desert north, there would still be many people who would go and have an affair with Mongol women whose tents were full of smells as soon as they took off their pants (hence the term 'Horny Tartars'). Under such circumstances, as a window for display to the outside, as a bridge for communication with the outside world, if we eat vegetarian food and chant Buddha, do not go deep into ordinary local people, and do not act consistently with them, then we will be isolated and even rejected. From our actions, it can be seen that I bought a few girls, gave them guarantees of food and clothing, gave them work and opportunities to be influenced by advanced culture, and deeply understood and obtained the actual lifestyle and thinking habits of locals from them. As for what consensual things happened in between, this is something that even the local masses feel is very normal. On the contrary, Comrade Wen stuck to the superficial values of a Puritan, but attracted malicious speculation from locals about his sexual orientation. Is this really something beneficial to our mass of Transmigrators? A lesson, comrades, a lesson.

3. Women and our own people.

Although we have 500 people, it is very obvious that when one day we need to go deep into the ordinary local people to understand their thoughts, their habits, and to spread our gospel, is it true that only "our own people" whom we can trust are reliable? So, I say this is clearly a good thing that is beneficial to the great cause of the Transmigrators. On the other hand, comrades, do not forget that in this era, as masters who have absolute control over their persons, possessing them is actually a good thing for them, showing that they have already received the master's trust and have the space and foundation for continued development by the master's side. Please recall the masterpiece of the rotten feudal otaku paradise "Dream of the Red Chamber", where every maid racked her brains and intrigued to hook up with the master. Is this not an example of the positive and enterprising thoughts of lively and healthy young women in this era? So, on one hand, this indicates they trust us (Bricks thrown: "It's 'you'", not 'us'"), on the other hand, it is also us trusting them (Bricks continue to be thrown: "It's 'you'", not 'us'")...

4. Defense regarding the use of public funds.

Regarding the fact that comrades accuse me of using public funds to buy girls, I admit this, but on this point, I need to explain some objective circumstances:
4.1. When I went to Leizhou at that time, my vouchers and the vast majority of my silver were left in Lingao and had not been touched. Besides a dozen taels of broken silver for petty expenses, there were only these public funds managed together with Comrade Wen. Under these circumstances, our residence, our food and clothing were all supported by these public funds, but I can guarantee that including the money for buying girls, every single expense of ours followed the usage norms and reimbursement regulations. (Bricks thrown: "Oral words don't count as proof, where is the invoice?" "In this era, go write the invoice yourself...")
4.2. I said earlier that every cent of silver we used to buy these maids was public funds, but!!! Have you calculated the price? It was only 50 taels of silver (according to the discussion in Volume 3 Section 49, the package total was 10 taels, here I calculate as 10 taels each). You have also visited the human market, you should know what the price for buying maids should be. You also have to pay wages to workers. Now you calculate, I effectively bought 5 female workers for 50 taels, and immediately built up the internal structure and reception organization of Leizhou, saving a large amount of manpower to invest in formal work. Is this price worth it? I saw girls in the human market costing dozens of taels each, dressed gorgeously, fair and lovely, but I didn't make a move. Why? Brothers, the Transmigrators' own silver, can I not feel heartache?

4.3. When living in the collective dormitory in Lingao, I lived in the collective dormitory just like everyone else. I remember during the training mobilization stage before the crossing, whoever said it at the time might have forgotten, but I still remember (seeing some of the accusing otaku blushing, I am very happy). As a Transmigrator, since landing, there has always been a share of income that I deserve. Although not much, it is still quite a bit of silver. Since everyone still feels that it is inappropriate for me, Chang, to use public funds to buy girls, then I won't say much more. The situation at the time was that I didn't have ready silver with me, so now treat it as me returning the silver to the collective. Let these funds be deducted from my accumulated wages.

5. Humanitarianism.

I, Chang, do not consider myself a believer man or benevolent woman. After crossing, I fired guns and killed people. Usually, I also like to play with the ghost-head knife, plus I have a black face, looking murderous. But those who are familiar with me usually know that I am a gentle, conscientious good youth. I am not lying to brothers, I also speak of humanitarianism to captives. You have all seen malnourished people near Lingao, which is a common phenomenon in this era. But when I saw the few of them in the human market, they were even weaker than the weakest villagers we have seen here, almost skin and bones like mangy livestock (Wen Tong muttered: Is it that serious? They didn't look that serious when bought back). We are all youths born under the red flag and growing up in New China. Seeing these women dying under the lash of evil slave owners, and thinking that our purpose in coming here, besides liberating ourselves, isn't it to save the poor people still struggling under the evil feudal society? Thinking of this, who could endure such torture and interrogation of conscience, and still care about how much money it costs and whose money to spend to rescue them? (Wen Tong muttered: Just now he was blowing about how great he was at bargaining and how little money he spent, now how is he blowing about not caring about spending money?) I really couldn't bear to see it so I used money to rescue them from the hands of human traffickers. And just as I brought them to the entrance of the Leizhou Office, someone had already fainted from hunger. It really makes the hearer sad and the seer weep (Wen Tong muttered: Tears are coming down, Old Chang, you are really an acting school type).

6. A little suggestion for everyone.

Chang said these words here today, on one hand, because the matter was urgent when doing it previously, and I was in a remote place outside, too late to report, so now I describe the cause and effect in detail to everyone. Everyone knows in their hearts, so naturally, they won't say anything more about Chang.

On the other hand, uh, as a member who once worked during the day and jerked off at night, using a little personal experience, I helped everyone conduct an atypical experiment of an otaku harem in advance. There are some experiences and lessons in it, which I will also share. Later, hehe, it will be useful...

I, Chang Shide, defend. The above.
