# Chapter 1271: Wu Family's Morning

He turned the page of the newspaper. There were two pages dedicated to popular science: one for natural sciences, covering simple applied mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology; the other for agricultural technology, publishing popular science articles on scientific farming and breeding techniques. These articles were commissioned by Ding Ding from the Agricultural Committee. Wu Nanhai had also written a few pieces—it was quite difficult, as they not only had to be explained in simple terms but also written in a colloquial style.

The agricultural science section was the focus of Wu Nanhai's newspaper reading. He mainly checked whether the articles published today had any major errors. Some Senators, just to cope with the task, would copy from past agricultural popular science books, sometimes even copying outdated or erroneous materials. Wu Nanhai had many affairs to attend to and couldn't review every manuscript in time, so he had to go through them again in the newspaper.

After reading the agricultural science section, he skipped the policy propaganda page, which published various recently promulgated decrees and administrative documents, and turned to the "Advanced Commendation" column. An employee of the Agricultural Committee had recently been awarded the "Second Class Labor Hero Medal," and he wanted to confirm if it had been published in the newspaper.

The "Advanced Commendation" column occupied almost half of the page. Due to printing technology limitations, there were no photos, only small square boxes containing the honors received, personal information, and a brief introduction of deeds. Those with black frames were for award recipients who had died in the line of duty.

In these densely packed boxes, the first and second boxes in the first row were for Jin Wushun and Jin Liushun. They not only enjoyed honorary commendations but also had a special feature report on their advanced deeds below the column—this was a rare honor. Wu Nanhai knew that almost all who enjoyed such honor were martyrs. Looking at the honors they received, sure enough, Jin Liushun was awarded the Special Class Labor Hero Medal, which had never been awarded to a living person, and Jin Wushun was awarded the First Class Labor Hero Medal.

The Labor Hero Medal was recently established for non-military personnel who had made contributions to the Senate through various events.

Wu Nanhai knew about the deeds of the Jin siblings—the sluice gate was an agricultural facility after all. Wan Lihui had represented the Agricultural Committee at Jin Liushun's memorial and commendation ceremony in Jeju.

The middle insert of the newspaper was, as usual, the advertisement page. Today's advertisement was for the *Collected Commentaries on the Four Books and Five Classics* by Australian Great Scholars, printed by the Printing House. It was currently on promotion, with a 10% discount for the full set and a 5% discount for single volumes if purchased with the discount coupon in the newspaper.

Following that were product advertisements from various shops and trading firms in Lingao, including both enterprises under the Ministry of Commerce and various private enterprises: "Fujian Autumn New Tea Arrival," "Nanhai Cigars, Enjoyment Like a Chief," "Qionghai Firm New Arrival of Nanjing Velvet..."

Wu Nanhai's gaze fell on a large advertisement for the Cooperative's Autumn Life New Products Exhibition and Sale. Although there was no discount content, there was a detailed catalog and prices of the new products at the exhibition. Many were new products and the prices were not cheap. It seemed this was intended to attract the maids of the Senators' families—he should let Chuqing go for a stroll and see if there were any new things to buy.

While Wu Nanhai was reading the newspaper, Chuqing and a maid were preparing breakfast in the kitchen. Chuqing opened the lower compartment of the refrigerator and took out eggs. Since the Agricultural Committee established intensive chicken farms in various communal farms and widely promoted small-scale breeding loans in rural areas, eggs were no longer a special supply commodity. Not only was the supply for Senators more than enough, but they could also be supplied in large quantities to the cafeterias of schools, government offices, and enterprises.

This refrigerator was not an electric refrigerator, but a traditional icebox. This type of refrigerator was manufactured by the Machinery Department referring to the structure of refrigerators that used natural ice for refrigeration in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, using ice blocks made by cold storage. Its overall appearance resembled a large three-door refrigerator. The outer layer was wooden boards filled with sawdust for insulation, and the inner lining was tin-plated thin steel sheets. The partitions inside the box were made of the same material, only with many holes drilled to facilitate the flow of cold air.

On its left side, there were upper and lower doors. The upper space had a tinplate box for placing ice. The lower door was divided into upper and lower parts. The upper part was a water tray to catch the water dripping from the melting natural ice in the upper space, and the lower part could also hold a small amount of items that needed refrigeration. The right side of the refrigerator was a full-length door, divided into four compartments for storing chilled food.

This kind of refrigerator was very heavy and bulky, but for places that could not yet manufacture compressors and did not have the conditions for gas refrigerators, it was very convenient. The cold storage delivered ice blocks daily at a fixed time. One block could last a whole day. In a place like Lingao where the temperature was on the high side, it was an important magic weapon for keeping food fresh.

A flat-bottomed frying pan was heated on the stove—this frying pan was made of iron and was quite heavy, but it was very easy to use. Chuqing poured peanut oil specially supplied by Nanhai Farm for the General Office into the pan, and then cracked in two eggs. At the other end of the stove, Sister Ju was checking the fire at the stove opening, adding a handful of wood shavings from time to time. Due to the impact of Operation Engine, coal consumption everywhere had surged. The stingy Planning Commission suspended the coal briquette quota for Senators' families and instead sent leftover materials from the lumber factory as fuel for stoves. A large bag every day looked like a lot, but it was actually only enough for one day's use.

Sister Ju added fuel to the stove while pulling the bellows to feed air, making the stove burn more vigorously. Sister Ju's husband's surname was Liu, called Liu Ashui. The couple was about 50 years old, from Foshan, Guangdong. They originally crossed the sea to defect to relatives working in the factory, but couldn't find them. When looking for work, because they were older, the physical examination deemed them unsuitable for heavy physical labor in factories. So they were listed on the waiting list for light physical labor.

 It just so happened that Wu Nanhai needed someone to help look after the small chapel, and the family also needed servants and a coachman. So after passing the review by the General Office and the General Bureau of Political Security, they became servants of the Wu family. Because the issue of whether Senators could own domestic slaves had not been discussed, they signed an employment contract rather than a deed of sale.

The couple lived in the small chapel. Sister Ju came to the house at 5:30 every morning to help in the kitchen, and then was responsible for the housework of this family—Chuqing was now also a key naturalized cadre in the Agricultural Committee system. She was very busy with work and didn't have much time to take care of the family. Old Man Liu was responsible for pulling the rickshaw for Wu Nanhai and doing some odd jobs.

"Husband, breakfast is ready."

Chuqing said as she brought a tray of breakfast and set it on the Eight Immortals table. The staple food for breakfast was vegetable soaked rice: cooked from last night's cold rice with water and chopped vegetables. The side dishes for the porridge were four kinds of pickles from Tianchu Food Factory: olive vegetable, pickled radish, shrimp oil baby cucumber, and Sichuan-style pickled cabbage. Each person also had a fried egg.

"I originally wanted to make preserved egg porridge, but I forgot to grind the broken rice last night." Chuqing untied the apron strings behind her back, "I will definitely make it tomorrow."

"It doesn't matter, this is also very good."

Before the meal, as usual, was the grace. Wu Nanhai led the prayer.

After breakfast, Chuqing was clearing the dishes when she heard the doorbell.

At this moment, a knock on the door sounded, and Sister Ju went to open it. She subsequently reported that a messenger from the Senate had arrived.

"Please ask him to come to the living room."

The messenger came to the living room and gave a military salute: "Report to Chief, Trainee Yang Xingfu of the Special Reconnaissance Unit Training Detachment reporting for duty. This is my special pass."

Wu Nanhai checked the photo and name on it. Naturalized citizens who could enter the Senator's dormitory area had already undergone careful inspection by the guards. This was just a routine procedure for him.

After confirming there were no errors, he returned the ID to the sergeant and said: "At ease, Trainee Comrade. You wait in the living room first, I'll go get the document box for you right now."

Wu Nanhai turned and entered the study. The layout of the study was not complex, but the access control was the strictest. Not only servants like Sister Ju could not enter, but even Chuqing could not enter. Only he had the key to the room door.

In the center of the study were a desk and a large armchair. On the desk were several sorting boxes and a desk lamp, with traditional Chinese stationery and a Western-style inkwell set coexisting. Behind the desk was a row of bookshelves filled with various document files and books. In one corner of the room was a reinforced concrete safe. On a raised-end table against the wall sat several document boxes of different colors.

Wu Nanhai walked to the raised-end table and picked up a leather document box with the Iron Fist Chrysanthemum emblem embossed on it, which was locked with a padlock. This was the Senate's confidential document box. Because the Senate Plenary Session was not held every day, and most members of the Standing Committee had their own jobs, with some Senators not even in Lingao, some general content that required voting by the assembly was handled using this Senate document box method. Inside were various contents open to Senators, ballots for various proposals requiring simple voting, and meeting minutes of various relevant parties regarding the proposals. Every three days in the morning, soldiers from the Special Reconnaissance Unit acting as the Senate Guard would come to collect the documents delivered last time, and then in the afternoon of the same day, they would deliver new documents in the document box. After Wu Nanhai checked again and confirmed that the seal he personally pasted last night was correct, he took it out and handed it to Yang Xingfu.

After Yang Xingfu checked that the seal was correct, he took out a receipt registration stamp and stamped it on the seal.

"Report to Chief, the Senate confidential document box has been sealed. Please show the handover document registration form."

Chuqing quickly brought the document handover registration form and a box of inkpad from the drawer in the living room and gave them to Yang Xingfu. He carefully stamped his fingerprint and then signed the date.

"My schedule is quite full today. You deliver the document box directly to the Farm Cafe tonight and wait for me there," Wu Nanhai instructed.

After seeing off the messenger, Wu Nanhai looked at his schedule again: today's work arrangement was as full as usual, and so full that it would occupy time after work—Senators in Lingao did not work an eight-hour system. The standard working time was ten hours. There were plenty of workaholics who worked more than twelve hours, or even sixteen hours a day, or even worked for several days and nights without sleep. For this reason, the Ministry of Health had to issue a health warning, requiring Senators to sleep at least eight hours a day and advising against staying up late working continuously.
