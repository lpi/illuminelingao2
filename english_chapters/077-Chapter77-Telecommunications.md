# Chapter 77 - Telecommunications

Although the hydropower station and waterworks were somewhat crude, having tap water and electricity supply 24 hours a day was undoubtedly a great encouragement to the transmigrators. Everyone was beaming with joy. The cafeteria no longer had to cook with muddy river water that needed alum to settle for half a day. More importantly, people could finally drink relatively clean boiled water. The incidence of diarrhea in the camp dropped significantly.

Of course, the first batch of electricity generated was first supplied to the construction site and the industrial area, causing dissatisfaction among many people who brought laptops and hoped to charge them. However, Chang Kaien explained that the current voltage was unstable and could easily burn out delicate household appliances, which calmed everyone down—no one wanted to scrap the only computer in their hands in this time and space where no parts could be replaced.

Following closely behind the power grid project was Li Yun's telecommunications project. In fact, Li Yun's "Telecommunications Group" had only 4 people including himself, and their equipment was pitifully scarce—except for the walkie-talkies and vehicle-mounted radios in the hands of the Military Team and the Construction Team.

In the original plan, the communicators were preparing to build a small wired telephone network in the Bairen City area, centered on a 200-line program-controlled exchange brought from the ship. But this plan was temporarily rejected by the Executive Committee. The reason was simple: they didn't have enough telephone sets.

"We only have 50 telephone sets on hand, and there are almost 20 departments in the Executive Committee alone. We simply can't allocate them."

"If we can't allocate them, then don't allocate them. Establish a public telephone system." Li Yun suggested.

Li Yun's public telephone network was very simple. Telephone booths were set up in the cafeteria, dormitory area, Administrative Zone, industrial area, and other densely populated areas, or telephones were installed in offices, with dedicated personnel on duty to answer and transfer.

"This is feasible," Ma Qianzhu nodded, "But do you have cables? We don't have copper mines yet."

"We collected a batch of field twisted pairs. Although not much, it should be enough to lay within the main urban area. My opinion is to lay the lines along with the power grid construction first."

"Okay, you produce a line layout diagram, and let the Architecture Team help erect the poles."

Li Yun's biggest reliance was a small program-controlled exchange eliminated by a certain unit. It could accommodate 200 numbers. This kind of equipment eliminated in the 21st century was advanced technology here. He spent a few days debugging the machine in the Simple Room in the Administrative Zone.

The erection of telephone lines was much faster than the power grid. They were all hung on the cement poles of the power grid. The twisted pair wrapped in black rubber skin extended from the Administrative Zone to all directions.

While Li Yun was busy with the telephone network, the transmigrators' radio station was also established. This was not a broadcasting station, but a radio communication station responsible for contacting teams going out.

The transmigrators' radio communication mainly relied on shortwave radio stations. There were 4 high-power vehicle/ship-mounted shortwave radio stations available on hand, plus more than ten small portable radios.

"With these devices, covering the whole Hainan Island is no problem." Li Yun said confidently to the Executive Committee members who came to inspect, "If the weather is good, contacting the mainland is also possible."

"Can we contact Beijing?"

"Theoretically possible, but it depends on the ionosphere condition." Li Yun said, "We also brought a set of 100W shortwave radio station specially for long-distance communication. If a directional antenna is erected, global communication is possible."

"That's useless, who are we going to communicate with? Emperor Chongzhen or King Philip IV?"

"Maybe we can receive signals from the original world?" Someone suggested whimsically.

"This is a parallel space-time, not the past of our world. We can't receive it." Li Yun shattered his fantasy.

The radio station was set up on a small hill in the Administrative Zone. Here, the terrain was relatively high, which was conducive to signal transmission. A simple wooden house was built as the machine room. Several towering bamboo poles were erected outside the house as antenna supports.

The daily work of the radio station was monotonous and boring. Except for contacting the boat at Bopu regularly every day, it was waiting for calls from the exploration team or the confrontation front line.

"Calling base, calling base. This is Exploration Team 1." The speaker came to life with a noisy voice.

"This is base, Exploration Team 1, please go ahead." The operator on duty immediately picked up the microphone.

"We found a coal mine! Repeat, found a coal mine!"

"Location?"

"In the area of Nanbaodong. The reserves seem quite large. We are collecting samples."

"Great! Pay attention to safety."

The news of finding coal spread throughout the entire base like wind. For transmigrators who were distressed by energy issues, this was undoubtedly a shot in the arm. Although the calorific value of lignite in Hainan is not high, it is better than nothing. With coal, bricks can be fired, cement can be burned, and boilers can be boiled... The industrial revolution can truly begin.

"Long live the Exploration Team!" Someone shouted in the cafeteria.

"Don't be happy too early, mining and transportation are big problems." Someone poured cold water.

"Transport by water? The Nanbao River seems to flow into the Wenlan River."

"That requires dredging the river channel first. It's a huge project."

While everyone was discussing the coal mine, the radio station received another message. This time it was from the Military Team.

"Calling base, we captured a spy."

"Spy? Local?"

"Yes, caught near the construction site. It seems to be sent by the county government."

"Bring him back for interrogation. See what the county government wants to do."

The interrogation work was presided over by Bei Wei. As a scout from the special forces, he had plenty of means to make a native from the Ming Dynasty speak.

"Name?"

"Li... Li Er."

"Occupation?"

"Hunter... no, militia..."

"Who sent you?"

"Master... Master Patrol Inspection sent me..."

Under Bei Wei's gaze, Li Er poured out everything like pouring beans from a bamboo tube. It turned out that the county magistrate was very panicked about the transmigrators' construction at Bairen Beach, fearing that they would attack the city after building the stronghold, so he sent many spies to investigate.

"They want to attack us?"

"Hearing... heard that the gentry in the city are donating money and grain to recruit braves, preparing to... expel you..."

"Expel us? With what? Spears and bows?" Bei Wei sneered.

"Also... also crouching tiger cannons..."

"Crouching tiger cannons?" Bei Wei dismissed it, "That kind of firecracker?"

Although despising the enemy's equipment tactically, strategically they must be valued. The Executive Committee immediately held a meeting to study countermeasures.

"Since they want to fight, let's fight." He Ming said, "We just happen to lack labor. Catching a few hundred prisoners of war will solve the big problem."

"But we can't be careless. We have few people, and the base is large and difficult to defend." Ma Qianzhu reminded.

"Strengthen the vigilance. Build more lookout towers around the base. Clear the firing range."

"Also, verify the intelligence. See when they plan to act and how many people there are."

The atmosphere in Bairen City suddenly became tense. The construction team began to accelerate the construction of fortifications. Barbed wire was pulled up layer by layer. Searchlights were erected on high places. At night, beams of light swept across the wilderness from time to time, making the spying natives think it was the demon's eyes.

The transmigrators were both nervous and expectant. They knew that a conflict with the indigenous regime was inevitable. This would be their first real test after landing.
