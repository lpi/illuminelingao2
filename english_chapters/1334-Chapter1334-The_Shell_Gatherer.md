# Chapter 1334 - The Shell Gatherer

Early morning, with the sky just barely light, the Bopu Fortress's lamps were still brightly lit. The night-shift sentries yawned, watching the duty clock on the gun platform, hoping the time for the shift change would come soon.

Two *li* away on the beach, several men carrying baskets on their backs had already arrived at the sand, guided by the distant lights.

Though it wasn't yet dawn, the beach already had quite a few early-rising local fishermen, divided into several groups stationed several hundred meters apart. Seeing the newcomers arrive, their expressions were somewhat unfriendly. If not for the Council's severe public order penalties, judging by their looks, blows would have been exchanged long ago.

"Old Dai, which spot?" Seeing people everywhere, some of them were anxious. The tides rose and fell in different directions; choosing the wrong spot meant not just extra walking but, more critically, less money from sales.

A man who appeared to be around forty stepped forward. He wore crude cloth short clothes, covered in gray, with wooden-soled cloth shoes from the Lingao Shoe Factory on his feet. He frowned at the sea surface that had already begun to churn, calculated the date, then said quietly: "Come."

The group circled around the people who had already staked out their positions and stood firm at a beach area with a slight inward curve.

By now the tide had begun to recede rapidly. The beach instantly came alive as the people gathering early morning seafood sprang into action.

After the tide withdrew, the beach was covered with seaweed and kelp. Live shrimp and crabs scurried about in a panic.

"Old Dai's got real skill—so much! Quick, everyone grab them!" The group exclaimed in pleased surprise.

Smiling at his somewhat panicked companions, the man called Old Dai—Dai Dehou—remained unhurried. He first removed his shoes and tucked them in his waistband, then began to work. But his targets weren't the conspicuous shrimp and crabs.

His attention was entirely on the shellfish lying quietly there. Avoiding the large, hard-shelled conches, he picked up oysters, mussels, and clams at the fastest speed, rinsing off the mud and sand in the seawater before tossing them into his bamboo basket.

These children of the great sea were gifts bestowed by the leaders!

In no time at all, his bamboo basket was full to overflowing. Dai Dehou casually helped two companions whose baskets weren't yet full to fill theirs up.

"Let's go!" Someone called out urgently, and the group was already hurrying away. Most of the shell gatherers on the beach were still bent over busily working.

Carrying the dripping, heavy baskets on their backs, Dai Dehou's footsteps were especially light. Thinking that they would soon exchange these for money, even the fatigue of staying up all night faded considerably.

In the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, they had already arrived at the Bopu port area. The innermost docks couldn't be entered freely, but on the port area's commercial street was a retail outlet belonging to the leaders' seafood processing plant, which both purchased and sold goods. Very cheap seafood was sold here every morning; some time ago, they had suddenly started purchasing shrimp, crabs, shellfish, and the like.

The retail outlet's large courtyard had several gates, all open around the clock. Dai Dehou and his group entered through a side gate. Inside, the space was large—immediately upon entering was a big courtyard with seven or eight unhitched four-wheeled carts parked there. Stacked against the wall were piles upon piles of wooden trays and bamboo baskets used for transporting fish. The air was permeated with a strong, pungent smell of seafood. The ground still had large puddles of water and fish scales, fish bones, and similar refuse.

Dai Dehou came to the purchasing station in front of the retail outlet. The gas lamps had already been turned off. The yawning purchasing clerk rubbed his hands and beckoned Dai Dehou and his companions over to weigh their goods.

Behind the purchasing clerk, the seafood processing plant was dimly visible. That cluster of buildings connected to the fishing harbor docks at the back. Fishing boats seemed to be constantly returning and unloading—basket after basket of catch was continuously sent to the workshops via rail carts. After processing, a portion would be sent to the retail outlet for sale.

"Hmm..." The purchasing clerk looked at the manual in his hand, carefully examining the shellfish in the baskets, then sniffed with his nose, before finally nodding. "All soft-shell. Freshness grade two. Pour them onto the scale. Thirty large *jin*, correct? Good, take this."

The clerk rapidly wrote a few lines on the clipboard, then ripped off a sheet and handed it to him.

What "freshness" meant, Dai Dehou didn't understand, but he was used to scales. These grade-two soft shells at thirty large *jin* could be exchanged for fifteen yuan in currency—he counted very clearly. Smiling, he accepted the purchasing receipt—and at the exchange counter traded it for three yellow paper notes, carefully tucking them against his chest.

Gathering shells was hard work, especially this first shift of the morning tide. The leaders had many strict and elaborate rules: morning and afternoon prices were different, and from the moment something was taken from the sea, the price dropped with each cup of tea that passed. After one hour, they wouldn't take it at all. Hard, large conches fetched poor prices. Shrimp and crabs fetched higher prices since they were still alive, but if they were broken or damaged, they weren't worth much either. Actually, these small soft shells were the most cost-effective. Moreover, only three hundred large *jin* per day were accepted, so every morning several groups took turns competing.

Still, this early morning first catch did pay quite well—this hour of work was better than his casual labor. Unfortunately, there was no fixed schedule for the morning tide, so he could only do this occasionally.

His several companions were all from Danzhou. They had met while gathering shells; fellow countrymen looking after each other. Dai Dehou had previously worked as a fish trader and was very familiar with the tides along the Danzhou-Chengmai line, so among the group, he was the unofficial leader.

"Old Dai, come have a drink?" His companions had also finished weighing in and warmly invited him.

"Not going—need to go back and sleep early. Still have to work the night shift." Dai Dehou smilingly declined. Staying up all night was too tiring.

After parting with his companions, Dai Dehou went around to the retail outlet's front entrance, where the morning's catch from returning boats was already on display.

Though still early, quite a few people had already come to buy discounted fish. Some had even come from the county seat—the train made coming and going convenient nowadays.

Unlike the usual fish peddlers and small shops in the area, the seafood processing plant's retail outlet here was much larger than even the direct sales store at East Gate Market. It had originally only done wholesale; after the railroad came through, it had started retail sales. It was like a market specifically for selling fish. Not only did county residents like to buy here, but it was said that merchants from Guangzhou came here to stock up too—rare fish that weren't available elsewhere could be purchased here, and prices were cheaper than in Guangzhou proper. Moreover, they offered ice-packing services; wooden crates stuffed with ice chunks and filled with seafood could be loaded onto Dabbo Shipping's express passenger ships. Delivered to Guangzhou, they were even fresher than fish caught locally at Huangpu.

Inside, the retail outlet was divided into several sections. The dried goods section carried all kinds of seafood products: kelp, laver, fish slices, dried fish, fish sauce, oyster sauce, shrimp paste, fish balls, fish sausage—everything one could want—all packaged in coarse paper, small bamboo baskets, or straw bundles and stacked on shelves. The fresh goods section was the largest: large yellow croaker, grouper, blue spinefoot, Spanish mackerel, yellowfin bream, prawns, flower crabs—all manner of common and uncommon fish, even those with no name one could call them—were alive and jumping in little pools. On the ceiling was a thick iron shaft that constantly rotated, using belts to drive water wheels in the various pools to continuously churn the water. The most novel was the chilled section: the leaders had inexhaustible ice year-round. Fish were arranged in bamboo baskets and wooden trays, covered with ice slush. Though dead, if bought and taken home to eat, they were just as fresh and delicious. The key was that chilled fish sold for only half the price of live fish; with morning and evening discounts, there were even two or three-tenths special pricing.

This wasn't Dai Dehou's first visit, and although he had dealt with fish for half his life, he still found the place somewhat dazzling.

The leaders really have great abilities, Dai Dehou marveled to himself. Some fish here, though common, were very rare at this season. Take that hairtail—in winter it liked to hide deep in the sea; ordinary nets couldn't bring it up. Even fishing with long-line poles, you'd catch only a few after a busy day. Yet these bamboo baskets before him held several dozen. And he had never seen this retail outlet run out of any kind of fish.

But he found it strange—why, when the leaders could catch so many fish and shrimp, did they still open a market to purchase live shrimp and shellfish? Couldn't they catch enough themselves?

Nowadays, Lingao's fish and seafood were so cheap that many nearby fishermen had lost their livelihood. Most had no choice but to join the leaders' organizations: those with some savings and big boats joined the Fisheries Cooperative Association; those without money and with small boats could only go work as fishing laborers for the Lingao Fisheries Company. Independent operators were fewer and fewer. Dai Dehou naturally didn't know this was deliberate on the Lingao Fisheries Company's part, aimed at maximizing utilization of the special human resource that was fishermen. Besides, these bulk-caught chilled fish from distant waters didn't cost much anyway.

Thinking that he was going to see his daughter at school this afternoon, Dai Dehou gritted his teeth and went to the fresh section. Prices here were double those outside; usually only wealthy county households and restaurant businesses bought here.

After entering, Dai Dehou saw price tags on all the pools. He was literate and looked at each one in turn. Many fish had names different from what he was used to—for example, what the leaders called "large yellow croaker" was what he knew as "daxian." Most of the fish here, actually, could be found in the chilled section outside. But the ones here were much bigger, and all were lively and jumping.

After another circuit, looking at the prices of many unfamiliar-named fish, Dai Dehou felt his heart racing with alarm. He hurried back to the entrance and had a shop assistant help him select a smaller large yellow croaker, weigh it, and put it in a wooden bucket with a ladle of water. Only then did he reluctantly pull out two yellow notes—this money was enough to feed his whole family for more than a day. Then he went to the dried goods section and used the change to buy a small bag of fish slices—his daughter liked to eat these—and then a bag of fish balls and a jar of shrimp paste.

These fish balls were the most cost-effective, priced only slightly higher than rice—much cheaper than even discounted miscellaneous fish. He naturally didn't know that this stuff was made from sweet potato starch and fish paste from various rejected-grade fish, produced semi-mechanically in large batches with little labor cost.

Carrying the bucket, with fish slices, fish balls, and shrimp paste in his back basket, Dai Dehou walked briskly to Bopu Train Station and produced his monthly pass for the gatehouse attendant to check.

His work was over at Majiao. This train monthly pass was really convenient. Without it, he'd have to walk several hours round trip, and he wouldn't have been able to earn these fifteen yuan in currency.

Entering the platform, it happened a train soon arrived. The morning crowd wasn't too heavy. Dai Dehou got on the last car, found a spot to set the wooden bucket on the floor, then sat down hugging the bucket. The train soon started. He fought his drowsiness and looked out the window.

Not far away was the main road from Bopu to East Gate Market—or in the leaders' terminology, the highway.
