# Chapter 22: The Conference — Food and Housing

Once they crossed to another timespace, the transmigrators would face three main categories of problems:

1. Basic necessities: food and clothing.
2. Protection from violence—whether from humans or wild beasts.
3. Protection from nature: harsh weather and disease.

Clearly, compared to the overly technical issues of industrial systems, most people cared more about these personal matters.

Modern society is highly developed, with extreme division and specialization of labor. Every convenience of daily life—even the simplest, most unremarkable—requires an entire industrial system to maintain. A single drop of tap water, before flowing from the faucet, is supported by electricity, chemicals, steel manufacturing, cement, construction, and many other industries.

In seventeenth-century Hainan, none of this existed.

Rice existed only in the form of unhusked grain. Water, after simple sedimentation, could only be sterilized by boiling. Clothing had no concept of ready-made garments; the wealthy could hire tailors, while common people relied on their wives to cut and sew.

Every daily necessity, even the things we take most for granted, available cheaply at any small shop—in that timespace, they simply did not exist, or existed only in extremely primitive forms.

As the Internal Affairs Team Leader responsible for livelihood matters, Xiao Zishan's proposed equipment list sparked debate.

"Rice hullers, flour mills, grain-processing equipment—is it necessary to bring them? The spare-parts issue, plus power consumption... there were already water-powered rice-hulling workshops in ancient times. As for grinding flour, Chinese peasants were still milling their own wheat well into the 1950s."

"Mm, I think even if we do adopt mechanized production, the Machinery Department could build them. Bringing them from this timespace feels like a waste of weight capacity."

"And sewing machines, sergers, cutting tools... Team Leader Xiao, are you planning to open a garment factory or something?"

"The Agriculture Group strongly supports grain-processing equipment! If Internal Affairs didn't request it, Agriculture would have!" Wu Nanhai sided with him. "Processing speed! Traditional methods of pounding rice and grinding flour are extremely inefficient. For several hundred people to eat, manual operations consume too much labor."

"You could use water-powered mills—China had them, Europe had them..."

"That means building a dedicated mill. The labor and materials consumed don't count? With electricity, we can drive this equipment directly and quickly process enough grain."

"The Machinery Department can handle spare parts." Xiao Zishan had anticipated questions on this topic; with Wu Nanhai's explanation, he could save effort. "In rural areas, dry grain is typically stored. For a crossing group like ours, using planned-economy-era standards: 12 kilograms of rice per adult per month. With 500 people, we need at least 6 tons of rice monthly.

"That 12-kilogram ration is the standard for ordinary citizens and office workers; heavy laborers get more. After crossing, with so much physical labor, we should calculate at 14 kilograms. If we bring in local labor, supply needs increase further.

"Machine-processed grain is high quality, free of impurities. Stone mills have high requirements for stone quality; poor stone means the flour is full of grit—bad for everyone's teeth.

"As for sewing machines—same reasoning. Clothes will eventually wear out and need replacing. Who do you expect to make clothes? Your girlfriends?" (Laughter.)

"Maybe you can find a local woman to marry. She won't know how to make our style of clothes. Teaching her isn't hard, but a purely hand-sewn garment takes days, even for an expert.

"Maybe you can wait those few days. But in the future, we'll be recruiting workers, and even—" he lowered his voice—"an army." He raised it again: "Will their uniforms also be sewn stitch by stitch by your wives?" (Laughter.)

"By that logic, ancient armies went naked? Hundreds of thousands of soldiers got new uniforms every year, didn't they?"

"That was based on having vast quantities of cheap—even free—labor. We don't have that." Xiao Zishan made a pained expression. "Our lives are finite; productive capacity must be directed toward climbing the tech tree. Better to bring necessary machinery directly. It can also serve as an engineering sample for future replication."

Housing was another issue of great concern. Internal Affairs had originally planned to purchase large quantities of tents and establish a tent camp as a transition before building permanent structures. The Construction Group proposed purchasing prefab houses for direct assembly—common on construction sites as dormitories and offices. Panel materials came in many varieties and could be selected as needed. They were lightweight, easy to erect, had reasonable insulation, and were far more comfortable than tents. Durability was also good: with proper maintenance, seven to eight years was no problem.

"Our company's had a department using the simplest corrugated-steel prefab as warehouse and office space for almost ten years now, and it's still in good shape." The speaker was Auntie Tian's daughter, Li Xiaolü—a petite Northern woman, around thirty, fair-skinned, wearing thin-rimmed glasses. "They can also be multi-story, but that requires light steel framing.

"Because of the harsh environment we'll face," her voice was soft and fine, "we should use higher-grade materials, such as magnesium-phosphate prefabs.

"These prefabs use polystyrene foam core magnesium composite panels for walls and roofs, steel doors and windows, and light steel framing. No special machinery is needed for installation; with simple tools, four skilled workers can assemble a standard unit—about 60 square meters—in four hours.

"Their modular flexibility is better than corrugated steel; units can be added or removed as needed, with doors, windows, and wall panels freely interchangeable. With reinforced structure, they can also be made into multi-story buildings.

"These houses have good sealing, insulation, and are made entirely of fireproof materials. They're moisture-resistant, corrosion-resistant, earthquake-resistant, and light—a standard unit weighs only 2,200 kilograms. Expected lifespan is over ten years.

"Dormitories, offices, and small warehouses can all use this type of housing."

"What about factory buildings?" The Industry Group was quite concerned about this.

"Large-span factory buildings won't work with these. But you could use cement-panel prefabs." Li Xiaolü continued. "Basically, angle-steel frame with cement-panel construction. They're much heavier than regular prefabs. The advantage is lifespan of twenty years or more. They can handle large spans and can also be built as two- or three-story structures."

"Cement panels..." someone said hesitantly.

"The Construction Group discussed this and believes our industrial system can produce cement and angle steel without much trouble. If factory buildings aren't urgently needed, we could bring only blueprints and necessary molds, jigs, and materials, and build on-site with local materials." Her face was somewhat pale. "However, assembling prefabs is skilled work. I recommend we send some people to prefab companies for hands-on training."

Wen Desi nodded and noted in his memo: "Practical skills training."

"Can we install plumbing and electricity in these houses?"

"Yes—though we can't run conduits inside the walls, surface-mounting is fine. However, the Construction Group's view is that dormitories and office buildings should not have individual water supply and drainage systems, to save materials.

"For water needs, we think it's best to have separate public washroom facilities, with three parts: shower room, washbasin area, and toilets. This allows centralized installation of plumbing. Given Hainan's heavy rainfall, we'll install enclosed corridors from dormitories and offices to the public washrooms for use in rainy weather. Winter temperatures in Hainan aren't low, so the initial design doesn't include heating for the showers."

"What about cooling? Summers in Hainan are very hot. We need air conditioning."

Though this drew many eye-rolls, deep down quite a few people actually hoped for air conditioning. They were used to it—in Ming-era Hainan, there wouldn't even be electric fans.

"Traditional air conditioning is definitely out." Li Xiaolü glanced at Xiao Zishan; seeing the moderator didn't object, she continued. "Traditional AC requires a lot of electricity and chemical refrigerants. That's too luxurious for us. If the Executive Committee ultimately decides to use air conditioning, we have two options." She seemed slightly dizzy, suppressed a wave of nausea, and steadied herself against the table before continuing:

"One is evaporative-pad cooling—essentially using evaporative ventilation fans, eliminating the indoor fan unit and compressor, with water as the refrigerant. Very energy-efficient. The downsides are high humidity, and the fans are quite difficult to manufacture.

"The other is groundwater-cooled air conditioning, similar in principle to radiator heating, except that instead of steam, we pump groundwater. This requires high initial investment: deep wells and copper tubing for evaporators."

"Personally, I prefer the second option. It works much better than the first. The system is also relatively simpler."

"Isn't that type of AC prohibited by the government? They say it wastes water."

"Hell, there's no such regulation in another dimension."

"Mm, I know. But wasting water is still the same—not environmentally friendly."

"You're worrying about environmentalism back then?"

"You can reinject the groundwater, so there's no waste," she explained. "For something more advanced, there's also geothermal AC. Similar method. About ten meters underground, temperatures are generally constant around 20°C. Drill down to that depth and circulate water as a heat-exchange medium between underground and the building—warm in winter, cool in summer. In winter, extract heat from the ground; in summer, release heat into it. Of course, our camp would need to be on geologically stable ground. If it's too active, it can only provide heating."

The attendees all looked at Xiao Zishan—he was in charge of internal affairs. Xiao Zishan looked at Chairman Wen Desi. In his heart, he favored anything that improved the transmigrators' living conditions. It's easy to go from frugality to luxury, hard to go from luxury to frugality—he understood this basic truth. A group of mostly pampered city dwellers, starting over in a wilderness, would suffer low morale if conditions were too harsh.

But he didn't dare state his position openly. These livelihood systems would require substantial industrial resources, and he simply didn't have the courage to take a stand in favor.

Wen Desi exchanged glances with him for quite a while, then surveyed all the group leaders for some time. Finally, he delivered a classic line:

"We'll need to study this issue further."
