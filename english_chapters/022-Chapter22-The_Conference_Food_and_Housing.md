# Chapter 22: The Conference — Food and Housing

Once they crossed to another timespace, the transmigrators would face three main categories of problems:

1. Basic necessities: food and clothing.
2. Protection from violence—whether from humans or wild beasts.
3. Protection from nature: harsh weather and disease.

Clearly, compared to overly technical industrial issues, most people cared more about these personal matters.

Modern society is highly developed, with extreme division and specialization of labor. Every convenience of daily life—even the simplest—requires an entire industrial system to maintain. A single drop of tap water, before flowing from the faucet, is supported by electricity, chemicals, steel manufacturing, cement, construction, and many other industries.

In seventeenth-century Hainan, none of this existed.

Rice existed only as unhusked grain. Water, after simple sedimentation, could only be sterilized by boiling. Clothing had no concept of ready-made garments; the wealthy could hire tailors, while common people relied on their wives to cut and sew.

Every daily necessity, even the things we take most for granted—in that timespace, they simply did not exist, or existed only in primitive forms.

As the Internal Affairs Team Leader responsible for livelihood matters, Xiao Zishan's proposed equipment list sparked debate.

"Rice hullers, flour mills, grain-processing equipment—is it necessary? The spare-parts issue, plus power consumption... there were already water-powered rice-hulling workshops in ancient times. As for grinding flour, Chinese peasants were still milling their own wheat well into the 1950s."

"Even if we adopt mechanized production, Machinery could build them. Bringing them from this timespace feels like a waste of capacity."

"And sewing machines, sergers, cutting tools... Team Leader Xiao, are you planning to open a garment factory?"

"Agriculture strongly supports grain-processing equipment! If Internal Affairs didn't request it, Agriculture would have!" Wu Nanhai sided with him. "Processing speed! Traditional methods are extremely inefficient. For several hundred people to eat, manual operations consume too much labor."

"You could use water-powered mills—China had them, Europe had them..."

"That means building a dedicated mill. The labor and materials consumed don't count? With electricity, we can drive this equipment directly and quickly process enough grain."

"Machinery can handle spare parts." Xiao Zishan had anticipated this. "In rural areas, dry grain is typically stored. Using planned-economy-era standards: 12 kilograms of rice per adult per month. With 500 people, we need at least 6 tons monthly.

"That 12-kilogram ration is for ordinary citizens and office workers; heavy laborers get more. After crossing, with so much physical labor, we should calculate at 14 kilograms. If we bring in local labor, supply needs increase further.

"Machine-processed grain is high quality, free of impurities. Stone mills have high requirements for stone quality; poor stone means flour full of grit—bad for everyone's teeth.

"As for sewing machines—same reasoning. Clothes will wear out and need replacing. Who do you expect to make clothes? Your girlfriends?" (Laughter.)

"Maybe you can find a local woman to marry. She won't know how to make our style of clothes. Teaching her isn't hard, but a purely hand-sewn garment takes days, even for an expert.

"Maybe you can wait those few days. But in the future, we'll be recruiting workers, and even—" he lowered his voice—"an army." He raised it again: "Will their uniforms also be sewn stitch by stitch by your wives?" (Laughter.)

"By that logic, ancient armies went naked? Hundreds of thousands of soldiers got new uniforms every year, didn't they?"

"That was based on vast quantities of cheap—even free—labor. We don't have that." Xiao Zishan made a pained expression. "Our lives are finite; productive capacity must be directed toward climbing the tech tree. Better to bring necessary machinery directly. It can also serve as an engineering sample for future replication."

Housing was another issue of great concern. Internal Affairs had originally planned to purchase large quantities of tents and establish a tent camp before building permanent structures. The Construction Group proposed purchasing prefab houses for direct assembly—common on construction sites as dormitories and offices. Panel materials came in many varieties. They were lightweight, easy to erect, had reasonable insulation, and were more comfortable than tents. Durability was also good: with proper maintenance, seven to eight years was no problem.

"Our company's had a department using the simplest corrugated-steel prefab as warehouse and office space for almost ten years now, still in good shape." The speaker was Auntie Tian's daughter, Li Xiaolü—a petite Northern woman, around thirty, fair-skinned, wearing thin-rimmed glasses. "They can also be multi-story, but that requires light steel framing.

"Because of the harsh environment we'll face," her voice was soft, "we should use higher-grade materials, such as magnesium-phosphate prefabs.

"These use polystyrene foam core magnesium composite panels for walls and roofs, steel doors and windows, and light steel framing. No special machinery needed for installation; with simple tools, four skilled workers can assemble a standard unit—about 60 square meters—in four hours.

"Their modular flexibility is better than corrugated steel; units can be added or removed as needed, with doors, windows, and wall panels freely interchangeable. With reinforced structure, they can also be multi-story.

"These houses have good sealing, insulation, and are entirely fireproof. They're moisture-resistant, corrosion-resistant, earthquake-resistant, and light—a standard unit weighs only 2,200 kilograms. Expected lifespan is over ten years.

"Dormitories, offices, and small warehouses can all use this type."

"What about factory buildings?" Industry was quite concerned.

"Large-span factory buildings won't work with these. But you could use cement-panel prefabs." Li Xiaolü continued. "Basically, angle-steel frame with cement-panel construction. Much heavier than regular prefabs. The advantage is lifespan of twenty years or more. They can handle large spans and can be built as two- or three-story structures."

"Cement panels..." someone said hesitantly.

"Construction believes our industrial system can produce cement and angle steel without trouble. If factory buildings aren't urgently needed, we could bring only blueprints and necessary molds, jigs, and materials, and build on-site with local materials." Her face was pale. "However, assembling prefabs is skilled work. I recommend we send people to prefab companies for hands-on training."

Wen Desi nodded and noted: "Practical skills training."

"Can we install plumbing and electricity in these houses?"

"Yes—though we can't run conduits inside walls, surface-mounting is fine. However, Construction's view is that dormitories and office buildings should not have individual water supply and drainage, to save materials.

"For water needs, we think it's best to have separate public washroom facilities, with three parts: shower room, washbasin area, and toilets. This allows centralized plumbing. Given Hainan's heavy rainfall, we'll install enclosed corridors from dormitories to the washrooms. Winter temperatures aren't low, so the design doesn't include heating for showers."

"What about cooling? Summers in Hainan are very hot. We need air conditioning."

Though this drew eye-rolls, quite a few actually hoped for air conditioning. They were used to it—in Ming-era Hainan, there wouldn't even be electric fans.

"Traditional AC is definitely out." Li Xiaolü glanced at Xiao Zishan; seeing he didn't object, she continued. "Traditional AC requires a lot of electricity and chemical refrigerants. Too luxurious. If the Executive Committee decides to use AC, we have two options." She seemed slightly dizzy, suppressed nausea, and steadied herself against the table:

"One is evaporative-pad cooling—essentially evaporative ventilation fans, eliminating the indoor unit and compressor, with water as refrigerant. Very energy-efficient. The downsides are high humidity, and the fans are difficult to manufacture.

"The other is groundwater-cooled AC, similar in principle to radiator heating, except we pump groundwater instead of steam. High initial investment: deep wells and copper tubing for evaporators."

"Personally, I prefer the second option. It works much better. The system is simpler."

"Isn't that type prohibited by the government? They say it wastes water."

"Hell, there's no such regulation in another dimension."

"I know. But wasting water is still the same—not environmentally friendly."

"You're worrying about environmentalism back then?"

"You can reinject groundwater, so there's no waste," she explained. "For something more advanced, there's geothermal AC. Similar method. About ten meters underground, temperatures are constant around 20°C. Drill down and circulate water as heat-exchange medium—warm in winter, cool in summer. In winter, extract heat from the ground; in summer, release heat into it. Our camp would need geologically stable ground. If too active, it can only provide heating."

The attendees looked at Xiao Zishan—he was in charge of internal affairs. Xiao Zishan looked at Chairman Wen Desi. He favored anything that improved living conditions. It's easy to go from frugality to luxury, hard to go from luxury to frugality—a group of pampered city dwellers, starting over in a wilderness, would suffer low morale if conditions were too harsh.

But he didn't dare state his position. These livelihood systems would require substantial industrial resources, and he simply didn't have the courage to take a stand.

Wen Desi exchanged glances with him, then surveyed all the group leaders. Finally, he delivered a classic line:

"We'll need to study this issue further."
