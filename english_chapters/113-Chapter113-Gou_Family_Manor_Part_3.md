# Chapter 113: Gou Family Manor (Part 3)

Lin Quan'an was pressured into compliance—only then realizing short-hair money wasn't easily earned. He said: "Your accent is still a bit strange. Best not talk much inside."

Approaching the manor, the gate was open. Chevaux-de-frise blocked the entrance; several militia stood guard; watchtower sentries kept watch. Security was reasonably tight. Lin Quan'an, familiar with locals, exchanged greetings, handed over some trinkets, and led Xue Ziliang inside.

The manor had about 200 households—mostly stone walls with thatched roofs. Some poor ones had bamboo-woven walls and roofs. Xue Ziliang found this quite curious. But he wasn't sightseeing—only memorizing roads, layouts, and directions. Few pedestrians—just elderly and children; adults were apparently working. Lin Quan'an walked along, shaking his peddler's drum. Women gathered to buy needles, thread, and sundries. Some without money bartered eggs or dried noodles. Soon his baskets were piled with goods.

Xue Ziliang accompanied Lin Quan'an around nearly the entire circuit. Only one gate. Walls were just over three meters—earth-and-stone construction, very solid. Almost no erosion visible—nearly cement-solid. Scattered wooden watchtowers along the walls. Walls stocked with stones and rolling logs for defense—possibly some cannons too. Inside, no defensive structures. The so-called inner wall was just higher compound walls—the Gou family's dozen core households clustered in connected residences. For fire safety, wide streets separated them from surrounding houses—somewhat resembling a fortress within a fortress.

Looking closer, these compound walls weren't simple. Though reportedly containing a dozen households, only two entrances existed: south main gate and north rear gate. The front street had a tall gatehouse; flanking it were brick-trimmed reverse-facing guardrooms with gun-loops for firing muskets and bird-guns. Thick elm gates were iron-plated, studded with large iron nails—axes couldn't chop through. The rear gate was small but solid; stone walls about four meters high—clearly substantial foundations.

But these obstacles meant nothing to transmigrators. Xue Ziliang felt his personal reconnaissance was somewhat unnecessary. With Military Group's firepower, breaking the manor was effortless. The only difficulty: how to open the gate. The wooden gate was thick and heavy, with massive crossbars behind. Best to blast it open—but Military Group had no demolition charges. Perhaps burn it with oil?

Leaving the manor, Xue Ziliang returned to the grove. He recorded all key points in his notebook and sketched an interior map. Those waiting in the grove had used telephoto lenses to photograph exterior views.

Wang Ruixiang suggested: "Let's send up the recon aircraft for some footage."

Xue Ziliang initially thought this excessive—but reconsidering, inner-compound conditions were unclear. After breaking in, fighting the inner compound would still require effort. Unfamiliarity with roads and layout wouldn't work. He agreed. Wang Ruixiang, hearing this, excitedly began assembling the large model aircraft.

This thing was enormous—disassembled, it required three people to carry, plus accessories, fuel, camera equipment, and a receiving laptop. They quickly assembled it—only to discover a problem: no paved ground!

This large model aircraft—unlike small remote-control planes—needed runways for takeoff and landing. In modern times, finding flat ground was trivial—even remote villages had roads or concrete threshing floors. Worst case, flat fields or grassland worked. But here, none existed.

Clearing and leveling ground was possible—but without tools and working in the open would attract patrols. Reluctantly, they packed up and headed back, disappointed. The first aerial reconnaissance mission ended in failure.

"Must develop a rocket-assisted takeoff system!" Wang Ruixiang said bitterly.

"On our way back—when opportunity arises—grab some prisoners!"

"Tongue-snatching?"

"Exactly." Xue Ziliang had already learned this Chinese slang. "Some things we need to ask them in person."

"Alright!" Everyone prepared eagerly—except the dejected Wang Ruixiang.

Xue Ziliang split the team into two groups, ambushing both sides of the road. This spot was neither too near nor too far from the manor—enough time to retreat, avoiding grabbing wrong people. To minimize disturbance, they'd use only knives and Wang Ruixiang's crossbow if combat was necessary.

Lingao's weather—spring, summer, autumn, winter—autumn and winter days could still reach thirty-some degrees. In the unventilated grove, everyone sweated profusely. Despite insect repellent, various bugs and mosquitoes constantly bit them. The recruits complained bitterly. Fortunately, over a month's hard training had built willpower—no one moved carelessly.

Occasional passersby on the road—but no worthwhile targets. After a long wait, a sedan chair appeared—a small carrying-chair with a blue cloth canopy. A master-looking figure sprawled lazily inside, accompanied by a dozen household guards and servants. A maidservant-like figure carried a bundle, following alongside.

Ye Mengyan grew nervous—crawled over to ask Xue Ziliang: "Captain! Big fish incoming!"

Xue Ziliang nodded. Clearly a Gou Manor VIP—possibly the big boss himself. Excluding the guide, they had four people—reasonable odds.

He considered, eyeing Lin Quan'an—making the peddler shiver. Every time these short-hair masters looked at him like that, bad things happened. Indeed, Xue Ziliang summoned him again.

The person in the sedan chair was none other than the Gou family's second master—Lingao County's underworld boss Gou Xunli, residing in the county seat. He'd recently learned the Bairren Rapids pirates had moved to Ma'ao Salt Field. Gou Xunli was educated, having worked county-government connections and lawsuit-brokering for years—quite insightful. He knew Ma'ao Salt Field was a major county revenue source. Brother Gou Xunyi had worked hard to control it. Pirates sending forces to the salt field obviously meant seizing this prize. A few days ago, he'd heard from yamen sources: pirates had met Secretary Wang, demanding salt-tax collection rights. Gou Second knew trouble was coming—quickly ordered his chair prepared for the manor. Counter-strategies were urgently needed.

Unlike Gou Xunyi, modern parlance would say his "eating manner" wasn't so ugly. He understood leaving margins—so in the county, though feared, his reputation wasn't too bad. Comparatively, Gou Xunyi was someone who, right or wrong, demanded extra advantage—feared making bad deeds insufficiently thorough or cruel. Gou Xunli worried about his elder brother. These shaven-headed pirates weren't ordinary small-time bandits. If conflict erupted, the Gou family would definitely suffer.

Gou Xunli planned to persuade Gou Xunyi: quickly send envoys to negotiate with the pirates, concede some salt-field interests—peaceful coexistence, mutual profit. He figured these pirates intended long-term occupation. They were powerful—attaching to them might mean short-term losses weren't necessarily bad. While pondering how to convince his hot-tempered brother, the sedan suddenly stopped. Opening his eyes: "What's happening?"

The head guard came to report: "A peddler on the road is crying grievances."

Gou Xunli cursed: "Damn it." Probably manor guards had robbed another peddler. These thugs only knew lawlessness—didn't even understand "don't eat grass near your burrow." Annoyed, he waved dismissively: "Drive him away."

Just as he spoke—twang—a bowstring sounded. The lead porter's neck suddenly had a crossbow bolt embedded. Eyes rolling back, man and chair collapsed together. The party dissolved into chaos.

With a whistle, four men burst from the roadside—all wielding gleaming short blades. Before guards could draw weapons, throats were slashed and they crumpled, blood gushing. Things happened too fast to react. Panicking guards forgot to draw swords—swung sheathed weapons at the attackers.

Ye Mengyan had no time to savor his first kill—seeing a guard charging him with twisted face, swinging a sheathed sword. He involuntarily retreated, tripped over a corpse, and fell on his behind—heart seizing with terror: *Mom, I'm dead!* Mind blank, hands instinctively thrust out his knife. The sharp blade slid in like cutting tofu—effortlessly hilt-deep. Ye Mengyan watched this man's eyes bulge, face contort, then collapse. Intestines spilled out. His stomach churned—he vomited his lunch's compressed rations, projectiling far and accurately onto the face of the maidservant cowering under the chair. The little girl, already paralyzed by the scene, catching this sour-stinking "facial"—what month, day, hour?—immediately fainted.

Though outnumbered, the guards were completely unprepared. The initial rush killed four. Arrows kept flying from the bushes. Nobody had stomach for fighting—everyone scattered. On the ground: six corpses, two wounded, three captured—including one maidservant. Regrettably, the sedan's master had bolted the instant the chair tipped—fast as a rabbit.

Xue Ziliang ordered: leave wounded and women—tie up prisoners and move. Ye Mengyan, however, noticing the pretty girl, insisted on taking her. Xue Ziliang, disgusted, had a prisoner carry the girl. The group hurriedly retreated. These weren't professional soldiers—post-kill jitters made them nervous. Herding prisoners, they ran frantically—too exhausted to feel tired. Seeing the team's pale faces, Xue Ziliang quickly radioed Bairren Fortress for a pickup vehicle. Returning to camp before completing handoff and reports, everyone was already vomiting heavily.
