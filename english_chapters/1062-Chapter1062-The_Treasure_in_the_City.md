# Chapter 1062 - The Treasure in the City

The men in the room exchanged glances. They were no fools. At this critical juncture, Huang Ande had suddenly summoned them all together—clearly he had some "scheme" in mind.

These were not peaceful times. Armies routinely robbed, raped, murdered, and burned without restraint against defenseless civilians. Even against the government, the slightest provocation could trigger mutiny or wage riots. Outright killing of officers and rebellion was not uncommon. The men surrounding Huang Ande were hardly the docile type.

"Brother Huang, just say it plainly. What fortune are you talking about?" Cao Qing asked. "Give us a good reason, and we'll all follow you!"

Zhu Si was equally excited. "Big Brother Huang, are you thinking about the official treasury in the citadel?"

Dengzhou City and the Penglai naval citadel stored vast quantities of military pay and grain. The annual military budget for the Denglai region was 800,000 taels. Historically, when Kong Youde's rebels broke into the Penglai naval citadel, they seized 100,000 taels of silver from the treasury alone.

"I heard there are hundreds of thousands of taels in there!" The others immediately perked up.

Huang Ande shook his head. "Even if the treasury is overflowing with silver and left wide open for us, how much could each of us carry?"

Once the city fell, the attacking side would immediately send troops to seize and guard the warehouses. Meanwhile, everyone inside the city hoping to profit from the chaos would swarm to the same spot. It would likely turn into a bloody battle. Trying to grab silver in the chaos of a rampaging army was like snatching meat from a tiger's mouth—even if you got close to the silver, you could not carry much away.

Thinking this through, everyone deflated.

"I think the waterfront pavilions and restaurants along the Little Sea must be full of money. Lots of wealthy guests patronize them—rich merchants all lodging there. And plenty of women too..."

At the mention of this place, everyone's eyes lit up. The Little Sea was the inner harbor of the Penglai naval citadel. Along its shores were pleasure pavilions and restaurants built by merchants, offering every kind of entertainment and indulgence. Officials and commanders frequented them, and wealthy traders doing business in Dengzhou often stayed there. It was a veritable den of gold and a haven of soft pleasures.

Silver and women—the two things that interested men most.

Huang Ande remained silent, simply smiling. Zhu Si knew that was not what he meant and asked: "Big Brother Huang, what fortune are you talking about?"

Huang Ande adopted an air of mystery. "Tell me—what is the greatest treasure in all of Dengzhou City?"

The men looked at one another. If even the hundred thousand taels in the treasury did not count, what else could be considered treasure? Could Brother Huang have learned of some priceless jewel hidden by a local wealthy family or high official?

Huang Ande paused, then said in a grave voice: "The most valuable treasure is Governor Sun himself!"

"Governor Sun?!" several men exclaimed in unison, then immediately clapped hands over their mouths. This was too shocking!

"Mm!" Huang Ande stood up, opened the door, and looked outside. Sun Yuan's brother was standing guard by the courtyard gate. Seeing him emerge, the man shook his head. Huang Ande retreated inside and carefully closed the door again.

"Tell me—who calls the shots in the three prefectures of Deng, Lai, and Qing?"

"Governor Sun, of course," Cao Qing said. "He's the court-appointed Provincial Governor."

"But how can he be a treasure?" someone objected. "Once Dengzhou falls, he'll be a criminal awaiting trial. Losing a defended position could cost him his head. Besides, once the city falls, Governor Sun will definitely take his own life."

"What if the city doesn't fall—and he doesn't die?"

"Then of course he's still the Governor, with absolute authority here," Cao Qing said. "But this city obviously can't be held."

"That's exactly why a great fortune awaits us. But this fortune must be won with our heads on the line. Are you willing?"

"Absolutely! Big Brother, just say the word!" Zhu Si immediately responded. Young and eager for glory, he had long grown tired of drifting through life as a common soldier and yearned to make something of himself.

"Good. Let me make things clear. First, this has nothing to do with harming ordinary people. Second, it's not rebellion. Third, it's not joining the Tartars. We're going to rescue Governor Sun. If we succeed, we'll all share in the fortune." Huang Ande paused. "But I must also say this up front: anyone who doesn't want to participate now, I won't stop you—just go home, stay put, and accept your fate. Just don't sell out your brothers. Those who are in, be prepared to lose your lives!"

"Count me in," Zhu Si was first to respond. One by one, the others followed suit.

Huang Ande drew a stack of papers from his belt. Carefully, he lit a small oil lamp, keeping the flame dim, and had them gather around to look.

"These are banknotes from a Shanxi bank," Huang Ande said. "Each of you take twenty taels—consider it a settlement for your families."

Shanxi bank notes from the capital were widely used large-denomination instruments in the north at that time. Ordinary people rarely saw them, let alone held one. Because Dengzhou was a hub for military pay and a major trading center, locals were more familiar with them—they knew such notes were as good as gold and silver.

The "Engine Action" forward command, to facilitate their operations, had exchanged a batch of reputable, reliable, and easily negotiable Shanxi bank notes through the Delong Bank's Beijing branch. After all, Delong's notes had little influence in the north yet.

Twenty taels of silver—without war, that was ten months' pay at their normal rate! And soldiers like them could never realistically expect to receive full pay on time.

Huang Ande had just handed out over two hundred taels. This generosity and apparent wealth made them all the more trusting. How else could a poor soldier like him come by such money?

Cao Qing pocketed his notes and asked: "Old Sun and Little Huang are clearly useless now. What about Brother Sun and the other two on duty? Should we bring them in?"

"Absolutely. Especially Brother Sun—he's one of Governor Sun's personal retainers. With him, we're already halfway there." Huang Ande said. "We need to find a way to get them back here tomorrow during the day!"

"Done!" said Cao Qing. "I'll think of something."

Cao Qing was a seasoned old soldier with connections everywhere. If he said there was a way, there probably was.

Huang Ande stretched. "I won't say more than necessary. Everyone go home now and settle your families. The city will fall within days. Anyone who has somewhere to hide their family should do so. Be back here before dawn."

"Done!" The men heard his words and knew action would come within days. They were all eager to get started. Zhu Si said: "I have a sword and bow at home. Should I bring them?"

"Bring nothing except daggers," Huang Ande said. "I have swords and spears ready here."

While urgent conspiracies unfolded within the Penglai naval citadel, Chen Sigen and Zhu Mingxia had arrived at Dazhushan Island in the Miaodao archipelago. This island was only a dozen nautical miles from Penglai. Though not as close to Penglai as Nanchangshan Island, Dazhushan and Xiaozhushan were small islands without substantial garrisons or naval vessels. At the time, Ming troops were stationed on virtually every island in the Bohai Sea. The two main islands of the Miaodao archipelago—Nanchangshan and Beichangshan—held large Ming garrisons and naval vessels.

Though eliminating the Ming forces on the Miaodao archipelago would have been effortless for the Second Fleet, Zhu Mingxia saw no need to act prematurely. As a third-party force, there was no reason to reveal themselves too early and attract court attention.

When a forward base became necessary for the Dengzhou operation, Zhu Mingxia decided to first seize the lightly defended Dazhushan and Xiaozhushan islands.

According to reconnaissance, Xiaozhushan Island had no Ming troops. Its rugged terrain and lack of freshwater meant only a handful of fishermen lived there. Dazhushan Island had only a beacon station manned by about a dozen soldiers.

A single squad from Chen Sigen's Special Reconnaissance detachment took Dazhushan Island effortlessly, using fishing boats. All garrison troops were captured. Then a company was brought in to secure control over the civilians and vessels on both islands.

In the overall Dengzhou plan, rescuing Sun Yuanhua was the first step. If they could snatch him from Dengzhou ahead of the rebels and preserve his position as Provincial Governor, he would have a voice in any court deliberations on "suppression or pacification." The three eastern prefectures would continue to follow his directions. By controlling Sun Yuanhua, the Engine Forward Committee would effectively control the initiative among the Ming forces dealing with the Dengzhou mutiny.

As for Dengzhou itself, Zhu Mingxia did not consider recapturing it particularly difficult—it was purely a matter of how far the Engine Action needed Kong Youde to escalate things.

For now, Kong Youde still needed to occupy Dengzhou. Without taking Dengzhou, the rebels could not absorb local Liaodong people, expand their forces, or rally the scattered Eastern River remnants on the various Liaodong islands.

"Dengzhou—let Kong Youde hold it for now," Zhu Mingxia said to Chen Sigen in the tent. "Let him use the good stuff inside for a while, then send it all our way. That way old Sun Yuanhua won't blame us for taking Ming property—war spoils are perfectly legitimate."

"Still, fishing Sun Yuanhua out of a chaotic Dengzhou will be tricky. Why not send someone in advance to kidnap him out?"

"That won't do. He's not the only official in Dengzhou. If the Provincial Governor disappears, it'll definitely be reported to the court. They'll immediately appoint a new governor. Besides, if Kong Youde captures him and we then rescue him—saving his position, reputation, and life—won't that make him truly grateful?"

They needed him to feel he was in danger, yet not lose all hope. Only then would Sun Yuanhua choose to cooperate fully with them.

"Since you insist on waiting until after the city falls to act, I won't argue. The key is pinpointing his location," Chen Sigen said. "I hope our intelligence people deliver."

This was the most critical issue. Dengzhou City had a perimeter of over 5,500 meters; the Penglai naval citadel over 2,000 meters. Both were large areas. Finding and rescuing Sun Yuanhua from within would be impossible without effective intelligence gathering. And their only intelligence sources were the agents previously deployed to Dengzhou and Penglai, plus locally cultivated contacts.
