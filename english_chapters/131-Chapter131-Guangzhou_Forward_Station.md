# Chapter 131: Guangzhou Forward Station

Liang Cunhou managed a smile, saying: "My grain relief serves two purposes: first, I can't bear seeing commoners homeless, starving on roads; second, I fear desperate poor might take desperate measures. Gentlemen, do you know how many refugees have flooded Guangzhou recently? Rough count: no fewer than 30,000! It's still autumn harvest now. Come spring's green-yellow famine season—who knows how many more! If someone incites uprising, the region would be devastated! Laughably, many gentry—calling themselves Confucian disciples—accuse me of seeking fame and popularity, as if I harbor ulterior motives. Ridiculous! Ridiculous!" Realizing he'd spoken too freely, he quickly cupped his hands: "Pardon my outburst!"

"Just missing two people." Xiao Zishan murmured.

"What did the manager say?" Liang Cunhou didn't understand.

"No, nothing." Xiao Zishan quickly changed subjects. "Young Master Liang, we'd like to recruit some refugees in Guangzhou—sending them to Qiongzhou for land clearing. Would officials object?"

"Land clearing?" Young Master Liang laughed drily. "Don't take offense at my cold water. You'll invest capital in clearing land—but likely can't even pay taxes. A year's hard work—all profiting those clerks. Recruiting refugees is charitable—but if things don't continue, you'll leave them worse off."

The Committee had given intelligence personnel important instructions: collect all Ming-era social information. Guo Yi, seeing opportunity, feigned ignorance: "Why does Young Master Liang say this?"

"I've never visited Qiongzhou. But I hear it's humid, malarial, typhoon-prone. Li people rebel. Though wasteland abounds, settling isn't easy. Moreover, you're all merchants—no examination credentials. Won't you be fat sheep for local clerks! At best, losing your investment; at worst, utter ruin! Ah, this world!"

Guo Yi could only nod agreement—dared not say more. While talking, a servant approached, quietly speaking to Liang. Young Master Liang stood, citing other business, cupping hands in farewell. Everyone parted. Shortly after, a servant ran up, respectfully asking: "My young master asks your lodging address? He'll visit another day."

Everyone exchanged glances: they'd been completely deferential earlier—neither reciting "thousand miles frozen, ten thousand miles snow-swept," nor discoursing on human rights, democracy, or freedom. What had this gentry scion seen in these merchants?

Guo Yi quickly said: "Our lodging is on Huifu Street—the shop called 'Zizhen Studio.'"

The servant confirmed, extracting a plum-red paper from a visiting card box: "My young master's calling card. Please accept."

Presenting a calling card on first meeting showed high regard. Guo Yi, having attended Yu Eshui's "Ming Dynasty Customs and Society" lecture series before departure, politely declined "I dare not accept." Only after repeated refusals did he accept.

Xiao Zishan, still worried, rushed to the escort bureau's mule and horse inn. The arrivals had already been settled under bureau arrangements. Sun Kecheng was initially dumbfounded—hearing they'd buy some servants, he never expected so many overnight. The bureau's entire staff mobilized: cooking, boiling water, summoning doctors for the sick. Chaos lasted until nearly first watch before settling.

Returning to Huifu Street, everyone deliberated. Goods weren't fully procured yet, but over 200 people were already purchased. Staying at Qiwei's inn wasn't sustainable—first, imposing on others; second, once fed, people's thoughts would wander. They weren't jailers monitoring 24/7. Better to ship people back first, then return for goods.

This proposal received enthusiastic crew approval—surprising Xiao Zishan. He'd expected them, having just arrived, to resist immediate return. Unbeknownst to him, several harbored their own schemes. Decision made: purchased slaves would rest two days at Qiwei's inn, then crew would transport them back. Others would remain in Guangzhou continuing forward station work.

Building renovation proceeded intensively. Per plan, the Huifu Street compound would transform into a front-shop, back-workshop jewelry house—selling various transmigrator-made luxury goods. Some finishing and assembly work could be done here; key processes stayed at Bairren Fortress. Former jewelry company manager Yan Maoda had jewelry design and processing expertise. He'd brought extensive new-style jewelry materials. He said: just recruit some skilled craftsmen—they could manufacture these pieces. Better than just selling glassware—avoiding conflict with agent Gao Ju.

Xiao Zishan, leveraging Gao Ju connections, recruited many workers for renovations. With ample funds—using jewelry house as excuse—the entire compound was fortified. Though not quite resembling the American Embassy, close enough. Imitating Shanxi money shop and pawnshop security measures: iron grating installed in ceilings against aerial intruders. Stone foundation walls topped with mortared blue bricks—extremely solid. Only front portions had traditional long windows; rear buildings had ordinary windows with iron bars. Most secure was the "vault" courtyard: three entirely brick-and-stone rooms without wood. No windows. Iron door with 21st-century locks. Similar to embassy safe rooms—for confidential matters. One room: telecommunications; one: conference room; one: actual vault—storing not just gold and silver but more importantly: materials, weapons, reconnaissance equipment. Besides radios, Intelligence provided: walkie-talkies, pistols, binoculars, night vision, digital cameras, laptops. Power: besides hand-crank generators, solar panel arrays—limited capacity, but sufficient for radio and laptop.

Originally planned monitoring and security systems were suspended due to power issues. However, an infrared alarm was installed at the safe room entrance.

Water: two usable wells on the compound. Sun Chang had already hired deep cleaning during initial renovations. To prevent delicate modern people's indigestion, the station brought a simple water filter and sterilizer—filter cartridge replaceable yearly.

*Deng Yingzhou* delivered 30-plus tons of materials and 5,000 *liang* cash. This was the station's entire startup capital. Per regulations, forward personnel couldn't withdraw from Gao Ju's 200,000 *liang* account.

Everyone bustled. Guo Yi sat alone, contemplating future operations. Committee's station tasks boiled down to: intelligence collection, trade conduct.

Either goal required first building broad social connections. They now had the Gao family and Qiwei Bureau as entry points. Next: expanding work across social strata.

Guo Yi recalled Yu Eshui's pre-departure "Ming Dynasty Socioeconomic Conditions" course—pondering which level to breach.

As merchants, directly cultivating mid-to-upper officials was difficult. Even spending heavily only bought superficial prestige—rarely achieving later-era official-merchant collusion. But officials had strong purchasing power and political authority—worth cultivating eventually.

Second: local gentry and wealthy merchants—credentialed or official-connected—the local powerbrokers. Gao Ju was such. More accessible, yet linked to upper officialdom. This stratum was the station's current priority. In Guangzhou they'd met Liang Cunhou. Though his cultivation motives were unclear, as a *juren*, his influence exceeded Gao Ju's. Properly leveraged, he could open major doors in this class.

Officials' secretaries, servants, stewards, guests; various yamen's clerks, constables—though low status—were highly active, knowing all about officials and yamen movements. For political intelligence, focus on them. Qiwei Bureau dealt with such people—could leverage their connections.

As for commoners: from them one learned market gossip and public opinion. This intelligence must also be collected.

But the entire Guangzhou station had only six people including himself:

Station Chief: Guo Yi

Commerce Directors: Yan Maoda, Zhang Xin

Radio Operator: Zhang Yuchen

Intelligence Operatives: Lu Rong, PEPI

Just these few handling so much was somewhat difficult. Yan Maoda and Zhang Xin—both sales veterans—battle-hardened commercial operators. Once adapting here and improving Cantonese-Mandarin, commercial entertainment and sales organization would be child's play.

Zhang Yuchen was communications staff—also taciturn—could only handle internal affairs.

Intelligence work apparently fell to himself, Lu Rong, and PEPI. How to use PEPI was a headache. She seemed unconcerned—quite confident. Guo Yi strongly suspected she hadn't considered underground work's seriousness and danger—merely treating this as her performance stage. Her personal luggage alone filled a dozen boxes—he knew without looking: all costumes.

He organized his thoughts—drafting current-phase objectives and station regulations. He'd meet with the remaining forward team before Xiao Zishan's departure—assigning work.
