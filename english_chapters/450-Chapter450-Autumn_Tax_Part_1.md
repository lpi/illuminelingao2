# Chapter 450 Autumn Tax (Part 1)

"Sir had better take a look," Wu De smiled. "Otherwise, if you destroy it upon return, I'm afraid it will be too late for regrets."

Wang Zhaomin blushed, feeling extremely embarrassed at having his thoughts seen through. being told this, he had to open the envelope. Inside was a piece of paper.

This was a sheet of thick paper made by the Australian paper mill, extremely crisp and stiff, with a faint yellow patterned background. It felt very comfortable to the touch. Wang Zhaomin's heart stirred; taking it out to look carefully, it turned out to be a Delong Bank provincial bank draft with a face value of one hundred taels.

Because of taking tonics, Wang Zhaomin had close dealings with Run Shi Tang. He had heard Yang Shixiang say: The Australians have now issued a kind of silver draft that can be exchanged for cash silver at designated merchant houses all over Guangdong Province. Large amounts of silver don't need to be carried on one's person, nor entrusted to convoy agencies for transport. Just deposit the silver at the counter, pay the "remittance fee" according to the amount, and one can take the draft to exchange in another place. It was extremely convenient.

Carrying this bill on one's body was much more convenient than a large amount of silver. Not to mention anything else, one hundred taels of silver wrapped in a bundle was a very large package—too conspicuous. One could also add secret marks and seals to the bill, so even if lost, it wouldn't be falsely claimed.

Wang Zhaomin knew this was paying his "Private Fee" for grain collection in advance, asking him to help more during the grain collection process—he had never met such a straightforward master before—and his psychology gained great satisfaction. He cupped his hands: "Where I can be of use, I will naturally be at your service."

Speaking to this point, everyone already understood each other tacitly. The night was long, and the conversation enthusiasm was high. Wu De still had an urgent matter to ask him, but the timing wasn't quite right just now; now it was about time.

He whispered: "How should we deal with this person Chen Minggang?"

"If you feign compliance," Wang Zhaomin closed his eyes, "you may not necessarily be opponents for this old fox..."

Wu De understood perfectly. It was about the same as he thought.

"I have been taught."

The two people's secretive conversation lasted until early morning. Wu De returned to his office under the cover of night. The room was brightly lit. The members of the County Yamen Leadership Working Group hadn't slept yet and were gathered in the conference room discussing issues.

There was a group of professional personnel transferred from various departments specifically for the land tax matter, mainly financial talents, plus an Army combat engineer Pan Da—he was transferred because he had worked in the Tax Bureau and was very clear about tax collection systems.

Of course, there was also Xiong Buyou responsible for external liaison, and Dong Weiwei responsible for surveying—this half-baked Ming history enthusiast also came, not to rely on her Ming history knowledge, but because she had been doing social surveys in the countryside for months and possessed first-hand materials.

There was also a group of liaison officers responsible for coordination with various ministries and commissions, people like Sun Xiao from the Planning Commission and Zhou Botao from the Political Security Bureau.

Wu De ordered strong tea to be brewed and conveyed the content of his talk with Wang Zhaomin one by one. Everyone was very interested in such intelligence information. However, the biggest controversy in the leadership group was how to dispose of Chen Minggang.

This cunning clerk himself naturally wasn't worth a penny, but the Fish Scale Register in his hand was a critical item. Exactly how much taxable land there was in the whole county was all in this book.

The Transmigrators had only done half of the county-wide social census, and the land ownership issue was an even more complicated matter, requiring large-scale land measurement and property rights verification. This wasn't something that could be done in a short while. The Transmigrators had just established authority at the grassroots level in Lingao, and their tentacles hadn't truly extended into place yet.

Therefore, regarding how to dispose of Chen Minggang, controversy arose within the leadership group. Some believed he should be arrested immediately, publicly tried, and then shot. Some believed in using him for a stage first. Of course, there was no objection to the final result of shooting this person.

"Alright, let's summarize the immediate problems." Wu De said.

The purpose of the Crossing Group undertaking taxes was mainly to take this opportunity to infiltrate and control the county yamen, and secondly to establish a fair and effective new tax system, reduce the burden on the common people, and increase revenue.

To achieve these two goals, they had to have a complete understanding of the county's land quantity, fertility, and property rights. Otherwise, they couldn't start.

The social investigation work that started after the Spring Festival, going through bandit suppression battles and grassroots organization construction, had shown initial results now, but it was still far from truly having a grasp of the whole county's social situation.

Regarding the total quantity of land, they had initially grasped some data through the work team's investigation. Some also proposed using model airplanes for remote sensing mapping to grasp the precise quantity, nature, and location of land in the whole county. But land property rights issues couldn't be investigated clearly just by simple mapping.

To investigate property rights, land had to be measured. Re-declaring and mapping was not only extremely laborious and troublesome but also faced enormous resistance. In feudal society, whenever land measurement was required, it was easy to do only when a new dynasty was first established and everything was being reformed. Every time it was conducted subsequently, it would always cause a strong backlash from the gentry class, and finally, it would often end up unsettled.

One of the fundamental purposes of the Executive Committee launching large-scale social investigations was precisely to prepare for comprehensive land measurement work, but it seemed now that the progress fell far behind. According to Wu De's statistics, through bandit suppression and work team stationing, they currently controlled roughly one-quarter of the county's grassroots administration.

However, this administrative control was still very weak; relying on them to conduct land measurement and checks was impossible.

Moreover, it was now the eighth month of the lunar calendar, and grain collection was about to begin. According to Wang Zhaomin, work had to end by early November. The time was no more than two months. To complete the land measurement of the whole county in these short two months was simply unrealistic.

"So, this Fish Scale Register is very critical for us, at least for now." Wu De said. "Before we have completely mastered the whole county's land property rights."

Although the Fish Scale Register was full of errors, it was the only proof before new property registration books came out. No wonder the Revenue Section clerk could make a fortune from this; no matter how dynasties changed, it wouldn't cut off their financial path.

"So it seems, don't we still have to cooperate with Chen Minggang?" Xiong Buyou said.

"Isn't it just a Fish Scale Register? We'll think of a way to get his Fish Scale Register into our hands." Zhou Dongtian said slowly. "I believe he will definitely speak."

"You are so confident?"

"Of course." Zhou Dongtian seemed full of confidence. "As long as you authorize it."

Wu De naturally knew how he planned to do it—but he had other plans.

"I have a plan. The land measurement work must be done, and the tax undertaking work must also be done," Wu De said. "But this plan needs to be reported to the Executive Committee for approval, and we need deep cooperation with Wang Zhaomin, so let's discuss it ourselves first..."

Before the autumn grain appeared on the market, the news that the Australians prepared to undertake the whole county's autumn tax had already spread throughout the county. This news immediately caused a sensation and also made the gentry and big households feel nervous. They sent people to the city to ask for news one after another, and for a time, the teahouse in front of the county yamen was overcrowded.

The news that came out was very bad, saying that this time it was Master Wu of Bairen Village undertaking it—as for the so-called Master Wu of Bairen Village, everyone knew he was a big chief among the Australians. For this person to come forward to undertake taxes, he obviously harbored ill intentions. Anyone home with one or two hundred *mu* of land, counting as a grain household, felt uneasy, not knowing how the Australians prepared to do it.

Whether it was Wang Zhaomin or Chen Minggang, both kept their mouths shut about the Australians' specific methods of undertaking grain tax. Everyone didn't know what medicine these two were selling in their gourds.

Commoners and small households were calm; anyway, they had to pay grain tax no matter who was emperor. Paying grain tax to the Australians was estimated to be about the same; it couldn't be much worse. Fortunately, the weather this year was helpful, with favorable wind and rain, and the crop harvest was good. Many people also obtained quite a lot of income by working for the Australians, so they speculated that this year's autumn tax might be easier to pay than last year.

After a few days, the gentry in the county publicly nominated Zhang Youfu to negotiate terms with Wu De, wanting to know from his mouth exactly how big the Australians' appetite was this time.

Zhang Youfu went to Wu De's place for a circle, and after listening to Wu De's instructions, he immediately returned home.

A group of anxious landlords and gentry waiting for a reply gathered in the living room. Some didn't come themselves but sent trusted stewards.

"Chief Wu said, everything remains as before this year." Zhang Youfu said.

A sigh of relief rose from the crowd. Since it was as before, their interests wouldn't suffer. Although some had heavy and unreasonable burdens, they didn't wish for any changes—after all, they could get by right now. If something really changed, heaven knew what it would become. Chinese people have known since ancient times that many things were bad originally, but the result of the higher-ups saying they wanted to change them for the better was often changing them for the worse.

"Chief Wu also said that the matter of undertaking taxes this year wasn't originally their idea." Zhang Youfu said to everyone. "They just considered that the matter of Reasonable Burden caused trouble for everyone, so it's better to combine it into the autumn tax for collection. Saving everyone from coming twice."

This wasn't unacceptable. However, Reasonable Burden was collected by village, while grain tax was calculated by land acreage. Someone asked how to convert between them?

"Autumn grain is autumn grain, Reasonable Burden is Reasonable Burden." Zhang Youfu said. "Just send them together when paying."

Zhang Youfu continued to announce that whether it was Reasonable Burden or grain tax, both could be offset with Grain Circulation Coupons. This news caused a stir among the landlords—usually when they got Circulation Coupons, they spent them immediately. Now hearing they could offset grain tax, many felt regret.

After Zhang Youfu finished saying a few points, everyone felt satisfied and dispersed one after another. Liu Youren sat at the very back and only got up to come over at this time, asking Zhang Youfu:

"Old Zhang! Is this year's grain collection still handled by Old Eight?"

"Naturally! Without Old Eight, and with the Australians not having the Fish Scale Registers in hand, how could they collect grain?" Zhang Youfu asked strangely.
