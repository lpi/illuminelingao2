# Chapter 105 - Mobilizing the Masses (1)

Throughout the day, they had made their greatest efforts to conduct propaganda, investigation, and inquiry work in every household, in addition to completing the arduous task of setting up the camp themselves. Although Wu Nanhai did not prepare much food, many team members still gave their distributed dry rations—Wu Nanhai's special "Jinhua Crisp Cake" and "Seaweed Rice Balls"—to the common people. Doing so made them feel slightly relieved in their hearts.

Xi Yazhou paced back and forth, very depressed, resting his chin on his hand in contemplation. To restore production, the first thing was to stabilize people's hearts. At present, inside the village, there was a shortage of food and clothing, and outside, there were harassment from bullies and pirates. These were all problems that must be solved. Leaving aside the external problems for now, the immediate hunger and cold of the masses were not easy to solve.

Du Wen broke the silence in the tent: "The masses' lives are very difficult. Seeing the masses in such a situation, we cannot sit idly by! I propose to start relief tomorrow, and distribute some clothes. The women here have no clothes to wear—"

"We don't have much capital." Wang Luobin was very clear about the assets they brought. Wu Nanhai only gave them rations for thirty people for a week, plus one day's worth of carry-on dry rations. Now most team members had given their dry rations to the masses, and there were more than a hundred households in this village, four or five hundred people. Even if everyone didn't keep a mouthful of food for themselves, it wouldn't be enough for a day's portion here.

Du Wen said: "Apply for a few more carts of grain from Bairen City, and cloth too."

"Grain, the reserves at Wu Nanhai's place are not much either. Even if a little can come, how many days can it support? People have to eat every day."

Xi Yazhou nodded: "Right, we can't just wait for the superiors to think of a way. We still have to base ourselves on solving it ourselves." He walked a few more steps and asked: "This salt village itself doesn't grow grain, so what did they rely on for food in the past?"

"Of course, they relied on income from selling salt or direct exchange."

"In the final analysis," Xi Yazhou concluded, "it is still because the production order here has been destroyed. The salt workers can't get normal income from drying salt, and even their personal safety is not guaranteed. How can they work hard to produce?"

Wang Luobin said: "So, we still have to—"

"Yes, we have to grasp with both hands, and both hands must be hard." Xi Yazhou said, "First, we have to find a way to raise grain. With grain, the emotions of the common people can be stabilized, and they can also trust us; second, we have to arm the masses. Let them have the self-defense ability to confront bullies and pirates." He nodded with a smile, "Right, just like this! Distribute weapons necessary for production to the masses, engage in production for self-salvation. Salt Field Village fully has the conditions to be built into a fortress of ours."

"I agree!" Du Wen beamed with joy and radiated vigor as soon as she heard about mobilizing the masses. "However," she frowned, "Raise grain? Where do we raise grain?"

"What is this place? A salt field!" Xi Yazhou waved his hand, "As a human, one has to eat salt. This place can produce almost a ton of salt a day. As long as there is labor, what worry is there about food and clothing! The new grain locally will be on the market soon. At this juncture, if salt can be produced as soon as possible, not only can the eating problem in the village be solved, but a large batch of grain can also be raised for Bairen City."

"Good, let's do it!" Du Wen's eyes shone with excitement. In her hallucination, she had already become the women's captain of the land reform work team in the movies, and her tone was extremely similar.

"But, now the salt workers dare not go down to the fields to work, and they have hostility towards us." Wang Luobin reminded them.

"We need to understand the origin of this hostility as soon as possible. Engineer Wang, you said last time that people here were not afraid of us."

"Yes, that's very strange." Wang Luobin also found it odd, "When I came last time, although the people here were not necessarily enthusiastic, their attitude was normal. This time it's really a one-hundred-eighty-degree turn." He paused, "I'm puzzled. Does the arrest of whatever Dog (Gou) Great Household or Sheep Great Household have anything to do with us?"

"Could it be that class enemies here spread rumors, just like the Kuomintang said in the past that the Communist Party practiced communal property and communal wives?"

Wang Luobin laughed: "Little Du, you are too imaginative. First, there are no class enemies here; second, we are not the Communist Party—"

Xi Yazhou started to laugh along, but stopped laughing halfway, saying thoughtfully: "Don't say, there really is a possibility." He thought for a while, "This matter most likely has something to do with Great Household Gou."

Wang Luobin said: "We had no contact with this so-called Great Household Gou at all. At that time, I just saw his people coming to the village from a distance on the dike. At most, he just knew we had been here."

"Cough, no hurry for this." Xi Yazhou waved his hand and picked up the walkie-talkie to call the people of the security team, "Quick, a few of you go, take Zhang Xingjiao, and bring that family with the female disguised as a male. Yes, don't disturb others. I don't need to tell you this; you are quite expert at it."

Saying this, he put down the walkie-talkie, turned up the flame of the kerosene lamp—the brought wind turbine hadn't been assembled yet—and said to everyone:

"Let's talk about the defense issue again." He spread out a newly drawn map of the area around the salt field on the table.

"Maniao Salt Field is flat land with no strategic points to defend. The village itself is not fortified either. The enemies we face include local landlord armed forces, bandits, and foreign pirates. These three forces very likely have collusion with each other. If our work group is stationed for a long time, besides arming the local villagers, the camp itself must also be fortified."

"Build blockhouses?"

"Need to be bigger. We have to protect the produced salt too."

Just as they were talking, voices were heard outside. Xi Yazhou said: "Du Wen, go get some candies and cups."

"You want to eat candy?" Du Wen was confused.

"There are guests, quick! What we prepared isn't enough. You have to be responsible for comforting that girl later."

Du Wen walked out.

In a while, the security group led that family in, with Zhang Xingjiao following behind. The two elderly people were trembling, and the middle-aged strong man seemed unwilling, deliberately dawdling. The girl disguised as a man followed behind with her head bowed and eyes lowered.

Xi Yazhou busily invited them to sit down and served tea. He had been in the army for many years and served as a sales manager in a large enterprise for many years, so he immediately wore a sincere and amiable smile on his face.

After a day of propaganda by the work team and the donation of some grain, the original mentality of fear and hostility had eased somewhat.

When they heard that the transmigrators came to the salt village to "eradicate the violent and eliminate evil, protect the territory and comfort the people," a layer of doubt and incomprehension appeared on their faces. The strong man grunted and muttered a few sentences.

Xi Yazhou already understood a bit of Lingao dialect. Combined with his expression, he roughly understood his meaning, so he asked gently: What exactly did the transmigrators do wrong?

Zhang Xingjiao translated the words. The other party answered back, sometimes coldly, sometimes mockingly, sometimes indignantly. Regardless of the strong man's attitude, Xi Yazhou always maintained the most sincere smile and spoke very politely. After several rounds back and forth, the whole story finally came to light bit by bit.

It turned out that Great Household Gou came to the salt village a few days ago and declared that the Short-haired Masters at Bairen Beach commissioned him to collect two hundred yin of salt. He also threatened the village: The Short-haired Masters have powerful firearms and will send troops to kill everyone, leaving not even chickens or dogs—the matter of the Battle of Bairen Beach had long been spread here with added oil and vinegar. Plus, Wang Luobin did bring people to buy salt a few days ago. Now being told this by Great Household Gou, the salt workers who were already breathless became even more desperate. More than ten households fled immediately, and the village was covered in clouds of sorrow and mist of gloom. Great Household Gou feared people would all run away, so he simply took away the village head and the clan elders of the village, coercing them not to flee.

"Outrageous!" Wang Luobin almost slapped the table and stood up, "Too shameless!" All the transmigrators present were shocked: this local tyrant and evil gentry, known only from Zhang Xingjiao's mouth, actually had such means!

"It seems this Great Household Gou is really not simple." Xi Yazhou smiled. He had somewhat estimated it, but this ability to use a tiger's skin as a banner really shouldn't be underestimated.

Xi Yazhou immediately explained to them that there was no such thing at all. It was true they wanted salt, but that was fair buying and selling, absolutely no reason to demand it by force. Saying this, he pointed to Zhang Xingjiao, whose face was already filled with indignation: "Ask this person whose ancestral grave was dug by Great Household Gou!"

Ancient people valued ancestral halls and graves immensely. Digging someone's ancestral grave was a deep hatred. When Xi Yazhou mentioned this, Zhang Xingjiao's face was already completely red, and he started talking to the family, his tone becoming more and more agitated. Seeing this, the family's expression slowly changed.

It seemed that local people were more effective with local people. Moreover, Zhang Xingjiao was a scholar. Although he had no official degree, traditionally in China, people with culture were still quite respected.

From Zhang Xingjiao's mouth, it was known that this family was also surnamed Tan and were cousins of the village head, of the same generation: the village head was called Tan Guiqiong, he was called Tan Guihuang, and that strong man was their son, called Tan Chengqing—salt workers hoped for nothing but clear weather to dry salt well. Tan Tianqing knew some martial arts, was upright, and was a straightforward man who dared to speak and act, having some prestige among the young people in the village.

After about half an hour, seeing the timing was about right, Xi Yazhou pulled the conversation back to the main topic: "Fellow villagers, very sorry. We are unfamiliar with this area and didn't know Great Household Gou would use our name to extort and threaten. We didn't know your suffering. Now the men, women, old, and young in the whole village have no food or clothes, and big girls have no pants to wear. we must think of a way to solve this first. Let's discuss together, to get grain, to get clothes, so that everyone has no worry about food and clothing."

"Can this be done?" The family stared at Xi Yazhou together and asked.

"Yes!" Xi Yazhou affirmed, "As long as everyone works hard together."

Tan Tianqing happily rushed to say: "As long as there is a way, we can exert any strength."

To drive away their long-term mood of discouragement and disappointment, Xi Yazhou emphasized: "We came to help the common people. As long as we know everyone's suffering, we will definitely find a way to solve it."
