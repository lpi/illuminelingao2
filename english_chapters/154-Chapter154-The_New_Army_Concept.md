# Chapter 154: The New Army Concept

"Didn't I already say—if coal's short, send barges to transport." Ma Qianzhu said impatiently at the meeting. "1500-ton capacity—even from Vietnam is enough for months."

"Easy to say—Vietnam also has a court."

"Later-Le dynasty."

"Crowned monkeys—" Xi Yazhou expressed contempt. "Just send an expeditionary force to destroy them."

"Don't say that—monkeys are pretty fierce now. Our small force would struggle." Yu Eshui said. "For places with established governance, we can't rampage like Europeans in Black Africa. Only trade."

"Unequal trade then—" Xi Yazhou suddenly brimmed with nationalist fervor. "Cannons mean trade."

"Okay, okay—don't digress too far." Ma Qianzhu interrupted Xi Yazhou's poetry. "Now I'll discuss military matters."

After transmigrators' First Anti-Encirclement victory and Gou family elimination, they'd opened Lingao's situation—winning peaceful construction time. But they should clearly recognize: as landing duration lengthened and activities expanded, various eyes would inevitably notice. Whether pirates or Ming—action against transmigrators was expected soon. Therefore, he requested Committee and all transmigrators: urgently establish the New Army with complete training and combat systems.

Medium-to-long-term: transmigrators' combat backbone must be timespace natives in new-style armies. Call it "New Army" or "Native Military"—core concept remained identical. Transmigrators' extreme manpower weakness meant even filling all administrative and technical positions was impossible—let alone soldiering.

Current transmigrator-dominated military must disband and reorganize into New Army. Currently, Military Group's long-term personnel exceeded 10% of all transmigrators—managing patrol, guard, and small-scale combat. This severely wasted human resources.

Planned New Army—Ma Qianzhu proposed "New Army" rather than "Native Military" to distinguish from future lower-tier forces—would have Ming people as soldiers and NCOs. As armies scaled, officer corps would also become primarily Ming people.

New Army soldiers would mainly come from peasants and old military—especially military households. After training, they'd serve as primary NCOs. Initial officers would be transmigrators, gradually supplemented by military academy graduates—so academies needed urgent establishment. Early cadets would be local *tongsheng*, literate soldiers. Early academies could merge with administrative and technician schools. Without those conditions, training battalion formats could develop officers.

New Army would use one-man responsibility system—but organize soldiers' committees at all levels. Committees could oppose non-combat orders from officers; if commanders insisted, obey—but committees could appeal to superiors including Military Department transmigrators. Committee members couldn't be executed before Military Department review, even on front lines. Soldier abuse would be severely punished.

New Army would be professional. Officers and soldiers would receive worker benefits—preferential housing and private plots, plus free new crop usage (other new crop users paid extra tax second year). In fact, New Army manpower came from labor freed by new crops.

"I have input." He Ming said. "I don't understand Ming military conditions. But armies that haven't fought develop bad habits. Before our '79 Vietnam campaign, our forces had many problems. Ming military—classic old armies—soldier quality questionable. Won't we recruit many veterans gaming the system?"

"You're PLA-born—" Zhang Bailin interjected. "Forgot invincible political work? Liberation soldiers were all from GMD-style old armies—all transformed."

"Can you do political work?" He Ming doubted Zhang Bailin.

"Relax—I'll handle it." Zhang Bailin was confident.

Ma Qianzhu said: "He Ming's right. We lack time for thought transformation. Military household personnel need more screening."

"We assign our people as base-level officers—start right. Three Disciplines Eight Attentions as control spell—morale naturally improves." Xi Yazhou recalled salt village militia training. "...Commanders act properly, set examples—subordinates won't dare misbehave. Old saying: one right suppresses hundred evils."

"Recruiting from military households is probably unreliable." Yu Eshui said. "Late-Ming military households weren't different from commoners—basically officers' tenants. Mostly elderly and infirm."

"But they're class-conscious. Lingao military households are worse-off than commoners. Local tenant laborers live better than them."

"Recruit from Li people. Mountain-dwelling—can form mountain infantry." Wei Aiwen again promoted his Li troop idea—recently frequenting Li areas for trade, building relationships. His private lighter stock was considerably depleted.

"Rather than Li people, recruit Miao people." Yu Eshui reminded. "Li people have deep ethnic conflict with local Han. We can only gradually reconcile—can't easily arm them. With good weapons, courage grows. If Li forces cause incidents—we're Pig Bajie looking in mirrors."

Hainan's Miao came when Ming forces suppressed Li uprisings—Guangxi Miao soldiers demobilized locally. Arriving late, they could only settle in high mountains—mostly tenant laborers for Li headmen or Han landlords. Some survived purely by hunting. Harder lives than Li. Historically, Miao had better Han relations.

"Are there local Miao?"

"Yes, yes—" Wei Aiwen quickly said. "Zhu headman of Nanan says there's a Miao village nearby. Hundred-plus families. If needed, we can scout."

"Recruiting Li and Miao is worth considering." Ma Qianzhu thought: recruiting a few dozen for recon units was controllable.

"Now I'll discuss military control." Ma Qianzhu continued.

Military was transmigrators' tool—tools mustn't bite masters. So current Military Department's independent operation must change. Once New Army was established, new military systems must be implemented. When New Army exceeded 500—outnumbering transmigrators—effective control was essential. His suggestions:

When New Army was established, Military Group's original personnel would be preserved as trainers and monitors. Building New Army needed officers—so halve scale to 20 as Internal Guard with modern weapons. Other 30 would enter New Army as officers—forming one training battalion.

Once New Army matured, Military Department's armed forces' mission ends. Except Internal Guard—everyone joins New Army. All subsequent military operations by New Army.

New Army would primarily use 19th-century weapons and cold arms. Initially: Minié ball muzzle-loading rifles and spears. Rifle-spear ratio: 1:1 for now. First New Army: 500 troops forming one battalion; plus one artillery company with 9 smoothbore cannons. If modern weapons needed for combat—apply to Committee; Internal Guard would issue.

Military Committee would establish General Staff with Army and Navy branches. General Staff commanded Army-Navy—but not Internal Guard. Military Committee handled Internal Guard's training and supply—but not command. Executive Committee directly controlled Internal Guard.

Military wasn't for internal conflict. Internal Guard's mission: maintain order, protect government organs, guard important materials. Also controlled modern weapons.

General Staff would establish independent military intelligence department for intelligence collection and reconnaissance.

Military logistics: temporarily no independent department. Executive Committee commissioned specialized departments; Planning Committee coordinated allocation.

Damei and Salt Village militia plans would continue—extending to Bairren Commune. Early stage: backbone militia system—one-in-three conscription. Transmigrators would train rotating village militia. Militia weapons: captured cold arms, old muskets, blunderbusses, and standard 6-pounder smoothbores (for village defense). With industrial capacity, backbone militia could receive Minié rifles.

Transmigrators lacked formal naval forces—only fishing boats for patrol. Fuel and parts limitations meant minimizing modern boat usage. Given pirates' southeastern dominance and unlikely cooperation, short-term priority: fortify Bopu as naval base. Army would support Navy's shore batteries, stationing defense forces at naval base. Navy would build battery at Lingao Point's sea entrance—protecting harbor and shipyard.

Zhang Bailin blinked: meaning you're coming begging for cannons.

After Navy's establishment, Fishery Production Group would dissolve into Navy. Fishing remained Navy's primary mission—so Navy would be dual-led by General Staff and Agricultural Committee. Bopu Fish Processing Factory remained Agricultural Committee's. Naval recruitment and training would be Army's responsibility—later independent.

To unify maritime forces and avoid multi-management: "everything floating is Navy's" policy. Whether from original timespace or locally captured or purchased—regardless of current use—all ships under Navy management.
