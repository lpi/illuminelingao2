# Chapter 144: First Lingao Point Naval Battle

Boarding-team leader Wang Ruixiang hadn't steadied himself when the deck beneath him began strange-vibrations. Flames erupted at the ship's-rail. No military-experience was needed to know: they'd walked into an ambush.

"Retreat!" Li Di's hoarse scream came through his earpiece. Instantly, Fishing-1 was engulfed in gunpowder-smoke.

"All hands retreat!" He quickly directed the boarding-team back toward the rail—looking for chances to jump back. Pirates were already swarming from below-decks—wielding short-swords, billhooks, and hook-spears. Numerically, they were at absolute-disadvantage. Even weapons weren't much advantage—5 pistols couldn't possibly suppress them.

"Throw Round-1!" He yelled. Already-trained team-members immediately pulled bamboo-shell grenades from chest-pockets and hurled them.

Round-1 was Mechanical-Department's bamboo-shell grenade—black-powder and porcelain-shards inside. Limited-power—but perfect for ships' cramped-spaces. Explosions and screams merged. Crew on Fishing-1's deck, platforms, and crossbow-positions fired rifles and pistols—instantly suppressing the surging pirates. Seizing the moment, Wang Ruixiang's team scrambled back. Collapsing on deck—under one minute, feeling like they'd circled Hell's-gates. Fishing-1 now looked terrifying—steel-plating pockmarked with dents; glass facing the boats was all shattered or cracked.

"Full-astern!"

Chen Haiyang, seeing the last team-member climb aboard, issued orders. Instant thrust-increase made the bow dip sharply, stern foaming—Fishing-1 rapidly reversed. The three boats were already enveloped in white gunpowder-smoke. Smoke flickered with fire; cannon-thunder rumbled.

Dense pellets striking the deckhouse sounded like hail on car-roofs.

"Away from windows! Take cover!" Chen Haiyang shouted into the mic—fishing-boats lacked armored-shutters. He struggled to see through cracked-glass. Then—"Boom—boom—" The boats fired again. Deckhouse was hit; everyone jolted. A large stone dented steel-plating, shattering into pieces.

"They were fishing for us!" Li Di was pale—already half-crouched under the control-panel.

Chen Haiyang shook his head—no time to talk. Clearly, enemies understood their advantage: speed and maneuverability. This trap aimed to cripple them at closest-range with one volley. But they'd underestimated steel-hull protection.

Smoke slightly cleared—two other boats were approaching Fishing-1 under eight oars, very fast. Unlike typical hard-sail single-oar boats. Decks packed with murderous pirates—many holding torches. Obviously planning three-boat-pincer attack.

Fishing-1's fore-and-aft Ballistae fired simultaneously. Close-range—both hit. Decks smoked with popping-firecrackers, causing commotion—but didn't stop advance. Round-2 was tear-gas: besides minimal black-powder for burst, containing camphor-powder and pepper-powder. Made for maritime-patrol security-missions. Minimal lethality.

"Hard-port, full-ahead." By now Fishing-1 had reversed 40–50 meters. Chen Haiyang didn't know enemy-cannons' capabilities—for safety, he decided to open distance, avoid three-boat-encirclement, then strategize.

Engine-roar intensified. Fishing-1 elegantly circled half-arc, easily escaping the pincer. Now they were broadside-to-broadside with Boat-1—both maximizing firepower. Chen Haiyang carefully maintained 200m distance. Based on Industrial-Department's test-firing of captured-weapons—this era's small/medium cannons rarely exceeded that effective-range.

"Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!" Boat-1's broadside flashed continuously. Sea splashed with various water-spouts—nearest splash 20m away. His confidence grew.

He didn't want to use Ballistae—reloading was too slow. Two people cranking levers took a minute to reset.

"Port-side rifles—free-fire!"

Already-enraged crew immediately triggered maximum-speed. On my turf—fishing for us? Outrageous! A dozen SKS-D rifles with 20-round magazines—dense bullets swept like monsoon-rain from bow to stern. People, planks, sails, ropes... everything shredded under 7.62mm M43 rounds. When Chen Haiyang ordered cease-fire—Boat-1 was completely paralyzed—drifting silently, smoking.

"Report damage!"

"Forward-crossbow: 3 wounded—1 serious. No life-danger."

"Aft-crossbow: 1 light-wound."

"Deck: 3 light-wounds."

Damage was minor. Ballista's bulletproof-shields and steel-parapet protected gunners. Honestly, enemy-fire was pathetically-weak. Deck-scattered projectiles included: iron-shards, nails, stones, porcelain-fragments...

"Notify Navy-HQ—send ship to secure Boat-1!" Since wounded weren't critical, Chen Haiyang ordered pursuit of remaining two boats.

Other two boats—seeing Fishing-1 high-speed-escape their pincer—had already turned, fleeing seaward. Oars and sails at maximum. Wind-and-muscle couldn't outrun machine-power. Diesel roared. Fishing-1 sliced waves, rapidly closing to 200m. Desperately, enemies fired stern-guns—all falling far from Fishing-1.

"Sink the Yoshino!" Li Di shouted excitedly on the bridge.

Nobody heeded his enthusiasm. Fishing-1 was just a fishing-boat—no underwater-ram. Not worth the risk.

Fishing-1 continuously launched incendiary-projectiles from Ballistae—tar-balls. Stone-core coated with thick straw-and-wood-tar paste, wrapped in straw-sacking. When lit and launched—left black smoke-trails in sky—easy for correction.

Bridge continuously reported wind-direction, speed, distance, ship-speed. Gunnery-officer frantically calculated with slide-rule—then announced Ballista firing-angles. Imprecise ballistics-calculation still showed immense value. After six shots—seventh correction hit fleeing Boat-2. Sails caught fire.

Ship slowed. Distance closed. Tar-balls became more accurate. Even aft-deck Ballista joined with high-angle over-shooting. Momentarily spectacular—smoke-trails wove aerial-nets; net's bottom was Boat-2 constantly struck by tar-balls. Fire intensified. Finally—probably powder-explosion—ship was torn apart with a roar.

"Signal Boat-3: drop sails, surrender."

"Understood!" Li Di immediately swapped recording-tape. Surrender-demands were standard: drop weapons, raise white-flag.

But Boat-3 clearly wasn't surrendering. While they'd dealt with Boats 1 and 2, Boat-3 had escaped nearly 1 km. Through 8× binoculars—they'd added extra oars aft; people frantically jettisoned debris overboard.

"Destroy them!"

Though unfortunate to miss prisoners—safely-ending battle was paramount.

Fishing-1 again accelerated to 200m, turned broadside toward fleeing Boat-3—letting both Ballistae achieve maximum effect.

Ten minutes later—Boat-3 became a giant torch. Probably powder was already jettisoned—no explosion. Through binoculars: desperate pirates were jumping overboard.

"Recover prisoners."

Fifteen prisoners were fished out. Wounded unable to climb aboard were left to fate. Those swimming shoreward were systematically headshot by rifles—no mercy for enemies.

This historically-named "First Lingao Point Naval Battle" erupted with transmigration-Navy completely unprepared. Battle lasted nearly one hour. Enemy's experience and cunning were fully-displayed; battle-preparation was thorough. Despite hasty-response, transmigration-Navy's excellent-training and massive technological-advantage achieved total-victory.

Boat-1, towed back by Fishing-2, contained only three survivors. Many had hidden below-decks—thinking thick-planking would protect them. All were indiscriminately shot or bled to death. Inspectors said: blood flowed from second-deck to bilge.

Ship-photos quickly got Intelligence-response: this was a common Ming-era Guangdong "double-mast fast-ship"—a Guangzhou-type for fishing and coastal-cargo. Well-made, suitable for open-sea—familiar to European and Southeast-Asian traders. Measurements: 27.5m overall-length, 21m waterline-length, 6m beam. These dimensions suited anything—including piracy.
