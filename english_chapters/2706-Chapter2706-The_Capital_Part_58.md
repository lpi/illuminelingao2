# Chapter 2706: The Capital (Part 58)

Having finished her preparations, Liao Sanniang pointed to an open high slope by the roadside and waved to Old Feng. "Uncle Feng, bring that bandit up the slope to be our eyes."

After speaking, she climbed up first and hid behind a large rock surrounded by grass.

Old Feng and a guard dragged the big man up the slope. Hiding behind the rock, Old Feng forcefully choked the man's neck, pinning him to the ground, and said viciously, "If you, knave, know what's good for you and clearly point out where your partners are hiding, I'll spare your life. My Master has a pair of 'divine water eyes' that see everything clearly; don't even think about playing tricks to fool me. If you dare spout nonsense, I have plenty of methods, and I'll use them on you one by one, letting you know that I am the Five Sacred One of today, the living King of Hell."

The big man clutched his bloodstained crotch, trembling all over in pain. His soul had long been scattered by Old Feng's terrorizing. He didn't dare cry out, only wearing a bitter face as he lay next to the rock with Liao Sanniang and Old Feng, pushing aside the grass to peer through the branches and leaves.

The man pointed to a section of the road ahead at the bend and said, "Because there's a fork in the road, my partner went back and forth to report. Before I left, I heard him say my leader would ambush on that road to rob the Masters. But I don't know exactly which section they are hiding in. I've told the truth; I wouldn't dare deceive the Masters."

Liao Sanniang lay beside him, listening carefully. She asked from the side, "Where did you come from?"

The man replied, "Same direction as the Masters, just a step ahead. We usually don't commit crimes in this specific area; this time we were foolish and shouldn't have provoked the Masters."

Liao Sanniang nodded and asked, "Do you usually take the main road or the small paths? Is this road busy?"

The man said, "It varies. Dozens of men carrying swords and spears traveling together is truly eye-catching. But if we split up, it's hard to coordinate and regroup, often missing the timing and failing the job. When there's no one on the road, we take the main road; when there are many people, we avoid it and take small paths. If we encounter few people, we rob them. This isn't a trade route; sometimes we don't see a traveler for days."

Liao Sanniang nodded, expressing full understanding of this situation. For Ming deserters and bandits with little organizational awareness or concept of time, their near-nonexistent discipline meant that once dispersed, it was very difficult to regroup in time, and some might never return.

Liao Sanniang asked a few more questions, jotting notes with a pencil stub in her pocket notebook. Seeing the man had nothing more to say, she nodded to Old Feng to take him down.

After the others withdrew, Liao Sanniang shaded her eyes with her hand and carefully observed the forested area where the enemy was ambushing, already forming a plan in her mind.

The trees on both sides of this road were uneven, good for hiding but bad for travel. To maintain speed, the bandits would walk on the official road as much as possible and avoid the wild terrain.

If she approached from the main road, the enemy would be in the dark while she was in the light. Advancing rashly would likely expose her. With the enemy visible, it would be no different from throwing a sheep to a tiger.

Liao Sanniang planned to enter the forest at the road bend, using the vegetation for cover to detour and engage the enemy from the flank and rear incognito.

For years, the Peking Station had been conducting "surveys" inside and outside the capital, drawing maps. Although not extremely detailed, they had rough maps of most areas inside and outside the city. Important landmarks like hills, roads, villages, temples, rivers, generally, and large grave mounds were clearly marked. This brought great convenience to their wilderness tracking.

Having decided on the starting position and route, Liao Sanniang sketched a few strokes on the map to aid her memory.

Liao Sanniang came down from the high slope, found Liu Chang and Zhao Liangjian, and instructed them: "Brother Zhao, wait for the time it takes to smoke a cigarette after I leave, then set off. Escort the cart slowly. When you reach the middle of the road, stop the cart and horses, and shout loudly as a feint, just as we discussed."

Zhao Liangjian nodded in agreement and urged, "If Lady Sanniang feels uncertain or can't find the bandits, retreat. Do not take risks lightly."

Liao Sanniang laughed. "Naturally. I'm not a novice just starting out. In the Jianghu arts, a good fighter isn't ashamed to run. As long as the green hills remain, I wouldn't do something foolish like acting tough out of spite."

Liu Chang spoke little, only cupping his fists and saying, "Be careful."

With the plan set, Liao Sanniang led Little Bazi down the road.

The two followed the road to the bend. This section hadn't been maintained for a long time; the surface was potholed and the tracks on it were messy, with wheel ruts, hoof prints, and footprints.

Liao Sanniang walked slowly forward along the shoulder, her gaze constantly switching between the ground and the road ahead.

Suddenly, Liao Sanniang paused and crouched down.

Little Bazi, a few steps behind, saw Liao Sanniang stop and immediately crouched as well, gripping his slingshot and vaguely vigilantly scanning the surroundings.

The tracks on the road were intricate, with many incomplete marks, but a patch of messy tracks in the middle of the road immediately caught Liao Sanniang's attention.

The marks blended into a chaotic mess, with only scattered lines faintly discernible.

Liao Sanniang leaned down and identified a relatively complete semi-arc from the mess. She measured it with her hand and determined it was half a footprint of an "eight-stitch hemp shoe."

Although there was only half an arc, it was very clear. The wind and sand in the North were strong; after a while, footprints would become blurred or covered by sand. Such a clear footprint wouldn't be more than half a day old.

The footprint was cut in half by a transverse mark—another person's footprint. The footprints of multiple people overlapped, trampled, and crossed each other, making it hard to preserve complete prints. This complex trampling indicated that this group not only had no formation but also likely lingered here briefly.

Few people walked this road, and even fewer in groups. A gang of thirty acting together would inevitably leave tracks. There would be more clues on the road they came from, but backtracking was impossible now.

Liao Sanniang's gaze shifted to the road shoulder ahead, where the tracks diverged left and right—one trail thicker, one thinner.

Liao Sanniang suddenly thought that the bandits might be spying nearby at this very moment. At this thought, her body stiffened, and her blood seemed to freeze instantly. But she immediately dismissed the idea; if the enemy were ambushing here, they wouldn't have let her investigate so leisurely. She was just scarring herself. She exhaled, and her body went limp again, but the sudden tension and relaxation left a layer of cold sweat on her forehead.

Liao Sanniang's heart beat violently a few times. She took several deep breaths, finally calming her agitated emotions.

Liao Sanniang steadied her mind and followed the trail with fewer footprints. From the direction of the toes, these people had left the road shoulder here and entered the bushes. Normal travelers obviously wouldn't abandon the main road.

Liao Sanniang pinched a pinch of soil from the road shoulder and rubbed it between her fingertips. The soil was loose and slightly damp, which would preserve traces longer.

Liao Sanniang surmised she would find more tracks off the shoulder, and indeed, she found a clear and complete footprint not far away.

She found a twig nearby as a reference, measured the length of the footprint, and broke off the excess, obtaining a relatively precise length of the footprint. Using this twig, she could measure blurred or incomplete footprints she encountered later to determine if they belonged to the same person, and also use it as a baseline to estimate the person's stride and travel distance.

She measured it using the first joint of her index finger as a scale. The footprint was roughly 8 *cun*. One *cun* is 3.2 centimeters. Multiplying the footprint length by 6.8 gave an approximate height of about 1.74 meters. In medieval society where average height was limited, this was a burly man.

This measurement method wasn't necessarily precise, but it was enough for a rough estimate.

The so-called "eight-foot" or "nine-foot" giants mentioned by ancients were mostly exaggerations and couldn't be used as actual references.

From the footprint, the person walked with feet splayed outward, indicating a duck-footed gait. The force on the forefoot and heel was balanced and steady, and the landing and lifting were crisp, indicating strong legs. The stride width at the widest point exceeded two *chi*—a large stride, indicating a robust youth.

Walking further, the vegetation increased, and more traces were left along the way: trampled grass, stems broken during passage, small stones kicked over, and more footprints from different people. Further on, there were dead branches cut by blades to clear the path. The cuts were fresh, indicating it hadn't been long.

Liao Sanniang frowned. There was no order to their movement; these people acted too crudely.

Judging from the number and types of footprints, this group had at least seven or eight people, roughly matching the number confessed by the captured big man.

All footprints pointed forward.

By now, Liao Sanniang had preliminarily confirmed this was the bandit gang.

Liao Sanniang stopped. She was puzzled: why did the bandits enter the forest ahead of the road bend?

Thinking for a moment, she suddenly remembered encountering a group of government runners on the road earlier. Perhaps external pressure had forced these highwaymen to hide in advance.

Liao Sanniang shook her head, dismissing the unnecessary worry. She didn't need to know the reason. Whatever it was, it was good for her, reducing the time needed to search for the enemy.

Liao Sanniang immediately changed her previous strategy of detouring. She switched to tracking along the clues at hand, but this sharply increased the possibility of encountering the enemy. She had to be more careful.

Liao Sanniang turned and whispered a few words to Little Bazi. The two opened a distance of three steps between them.

Liao Sanniang hunched her body. Her steps were very light; when moving, her heel touched the ground first, then the sole rolled down softly. Walking like this was quieter than placing the whole foot down at once and more stable than landing on toes first. The light, gentle movements made her look like a sensitive civet cat.

Liao Sanniang's combat suit was tight-fitting to reduce snagging. Made of cotton, the fabric wasn't durable, but it was soft, form-fitting, and stretchy. It didn't make much noise when wet, unlike the canvas hunting gear sold in Lingao, which, while sturdy and wear-resistant, would make a rustling *ka-ka* sound when moving wet, disadvantageous for hiding.

Liao Sanniang never used cosmetics on missions. The wind would carry strong scents to every corner downwind. Although sweat and body odor were inevitable, she needed to minimize artificial scents. She needed to blend into nature as much as possible, becoming an invisible ghost when necessary.
