# Chapter 16: Servants (Part Two)

Inventory complete, they returned to the hall. Gao Qing presented the ledger of household furniture and effects. Xiao Zishan did not examine it closely; he simply accepted it and set it aside. The three gathered around the table and began sketching a floor plan. Wang Luobin had studied drafting; though he had only a notebook and a ballpoint pen, drawing a rough architectural layout was second nature.

"Zishan, you're really stingy," Wang Luobin said as he sketched. "You're going to fuss over a bit of salted meat and rice? The man's got a whole family to feed. Just give it all to them—might even boost their loyalty..."

Xiao Zishan smiled. "Engineer Wang, this gift list shows forty *shi* of rice alone. At late-Tianqi prices, that's forty taels of silver."

"So what? You want to sell the rice for silver?"

"Forty taels of silver equals four years' wages for Gao Qing and his wife combined. If we hand them forty taels right off the bat, what will be an appropriate reward later?"

"Give too much now, and their expectations go up—is that what you mean?" Wen Desi said.

"Exactly, Director Wen." Xiao Zishan nodded. "The Gao family is indeed struggling, but they're getting by for now. Besides, we don't yet know the man's true character—no need to rush into playing the good guy and buying loyalty." He lowered his voice. "I'm certain Master Gao has given him instructions to watch our movements."

"Agreed—very likely."

"So winning him over right now is difficult. He doesn't know us, and he's probably afraid we have some ulterior motive. Moreover, this is our first meeting—he's done nothing to deserve merit or sympathy. If we suddenly shower him with gifts, what will he think? He'll report straight to Master Gao. In the end, we'll have given things away for nothing and gained no goodwill."

"That's true. Still, it would be best if we could draw him over."

"We do need to show kindness—but only small favors, gradually letting him feel our goodness. Over time, his heart will naturally incline toward us. And since he's not Master Gao's confidant, he'll be easier to win over."

"Not a confidant? This house is Master Gao's emergency refuge—how could the caretaker not be a confidant?"

"Didn't you hear him? He was only transferred here less than half a month ago. And a true confidant—Master Gao would never give to us."

"Maybe he said that on purpose. Maybe everything he said was fabricated?"

"That's possible. But I observed him carefully and don't think so. Gao Qing looks perpetually worried, his expression is dull, his gaze unfocused. He's not the shrewd, capable type." Xiao Zishan glanced outside. "Besides, whatever Master Gao's intentions toward us, they boil down to guarding against us and exploiting us—mostly exploitation. So he's unlikely to invest too much capital in surveillance."

"Then what do you plan to do?"

"We do need to offer small kindnesses. How does this arrangement sound..."

Just then, Mrs. Gao came to ask how to arrange dinner. Xiao Zishan checked his watch and found it was already four o'clock in the afternoon.

"No need for dinner. Have your whole family come over."

"Actually, I'd love to taste what Ming-dynasty cooking is like," Wang Luobin said wistfully.

"I hear it's heavy on spices..."

As they spoke, the whole family arrived. Mrs. Gao was of regular features, only dark and thin; she kept her head down and said nothing—clearly not a talker. Looking at the children: the boy's appearance was unremarkable, but his eyes still held a lively spark. Though he put on a serious expression, he kept stealing glances at them. The girl, however, was very different from the rest of her family—her skin was much fairer, her eyes large, her nose small and well-shaped, and she was taller than the boy. Xiao Zishan estimated she was at least 1.6 meters. He felt puzzled and asked:

"What's your name?"

The girl hadn't expected to be addressed first. She looked at Xiao Zishan in surprise, stammering and unable to reply.

"The master is asking you!" Gao Qing scolded. Bowing, he explained, "The girl has never seen the world—she has no proper name..."

"Let her speak for herself. You're her father—you can cover for her now, but not forever."

"This servant... um... is called Gao Dajie..."

Xiao Zishan nearly spat out his tea. Engineer Wang and Director Wen also looked like they were struggling not to laugh. *Gao Dajie*—"Big Sister Gao." What a majestic name. Looking more closely, the girl did have a bit of Michelle Yeoh's slender, long-legged look about her.

The Gao family stared blankly at their new masters, unable to fathom what was so funny about the name.

Gao Qing smiled apologetically: "Please forgive us, masters... A country girl, never properly named..."

"It's nothing, nothing," Xiao Zishan laughed. "Since she has no name, we'll give her one." His mischievous streak emerged: "Let's call her Gao Lujie."

Wen Desi: "Our goal?"

Wang Luobin: "No cavities!"

All three burst into laughter, heedless of decorum.

The Gao family watched these three masters—who had been laughing uncontrollably ever since learning the daughter's name—and began to feel frightened. They could only smile nervously from the side.

Wen Desi thought that by modern standards, this girl had the makings of a beauty, though Ming-era people didn't favor her type. A pity her frame was still thin—limited raw material. Whether proper nourishment could improve things, he didn't know.

"How old is this girl?"

"Re—reporting to the master," Gao Qing could barely get the words out. This Master Wen's gaze kept wandering over his daughter. He thought: *this is bad*. "Four—fourteen."

Fourteen? A proper little *loli*. Unfortunately, there was too much real work to do right now to bother with *loli* cultivation.

Xiao Zishan had practiced calligraphy briefly as a child and hadn't forgotten how to write traditional characters. He found a sheet of rough accounting paper and wrote in large strokes: "Gao Lujie"—thus bestowing a name.

"We thank the master for the name." Gao Qing led his daughter in kowtowing thanks.

"Up, up. Now that we are master and servant, we're one family. No need for so much ceremony." Xiao Zishan said, "Your wages, husband and wife, will remain as before."

"Thank you, master." Gao Qing felt relieved; he had worried the new masters might cut their wages.

"Your family has heavy burdens—it's not easy. We'll add half a *shi* of rice per month for your whole family. That should save you the cost of grain."

"Master is benevolent!" Gao Qing was moved nearly to tears and almost knelt again. Half a *shi* of rice was enough to feed the whole family for a month. With one sentence, this master had effectively raised his pay by five *qian* of silver.

"Here is twenty taels of silver. We come and go on the waves; travel is difficult. Consider this a year's wages paid in advance. The remainder is for daily maintenance of this place. You may also draw your monthly rice allowance yourself." Xiao Zishan paused. "Can you read?"

Gao Qing smiled awkwardly. But his son spoke up: "I can read."

"Oh?" Xiao Zishan had not expected this.

"He never had duties, so he hung around the outer accounts office. He learned a few characters." Gao Qing hurried to explain, then glared at his son and muttered, "What are you showing off for!"

The boy knew few characters—by modern standards, barely literate—but having learned from an accountant, he could also do some bookkeeping and work an abacus, which was rare enough in ancient times.

When asked his name, it was Gao Di. Xiao Zishan thought: the working people of old certainly had simple, straightforward names.

"Since you can read and keep accounts, you'll be in charge of recording expenses here from now on. Keep everything clear, line by line. Understand? You'll also receive one *qian* per month as wages."

"This servant understands." Gao Qing was overjoyed and led his son in repeated kowtows.

Assigning the boy to keep books wasn't about the money—it was a reminder that everything here belonged to *them*, lest over time the family develop thoughts of cuckoo-in-the-nest. Once such thoughts arose, anything could happen. Ordinary people might seem honest and docile, but Xiao Zishan had seen far too many who changed completely when their interests were at stake.

After surveying the layout, the transmigrators decided to designate the study in the first courtyard as the crossing point. They instructed Gao Qing that the first courtyard need only be cleaned every three days; otherwise, no one was to enter.

Gao Qing didn't understand why, but he knew not to ask too many questions about his masters' affairs. The only thing he found strange was that Master Wen had specified the starting date for the cleaning schedule.

After nightfall, the transmigrators opened the wormhole at the new location. Fortunately, the destination on the other side had not shifted. The hydraulic truck was pulled through, and the tall stacks of goods on pallets were transported one by one.

The next morning, when Gao Qing rose, the first courtyard was already empty. He hesitated a moment, then left and walked toward the rear gate of the Gao residence.
