# Chapter 78: Lingao's Counterattack (Part 1)

The so-called "differential treatment" for the three obviously meant distinction between him and the two ATF foreigners—their future treatment and development would differ accordingly. Whether good or bad was hard to say.

From a good perspective: he was Chinese; the other two were American. From the "those not of our kind must have different hearts" consideration, he was clearly a "target for unity." But from the perspective of certain countrymen who habitually favored foreigners, perhaps these rootless foreign friends would be more valued by the leaders, while he'd become a despised saboteur—in which case, his best outcome would be "controlled use."

This troubled him greatly. He knew leaders' thinking often differed from ordinary people's—and this peculiar mindset accompanied position, not person. Once someone became a leader, their thinking and logic diverged from others'; their true intentions became hard to fathom. This time-traveling group's leadership, he believed, would be no exception.

Since being assigned to the basic labor group, he'd quietly worked. "Keep your tail between your legs"—he naturally understood this truth known to ordinary Chinese people. But he was also constantly waiting for opportunity—waiting for the Committee to acknowledge him as a revolutionary comrade.

He hadn't expected that opportunity to arrive so soon.

While the transmigrators enthusiastically threw themselves into building their new city, no one realized this massive construction site wasn't adequately defended. Local people fleeing in panic after landing and victories in several small skirmishes had made the transmigrators complacent. The shipload of weapons from the North American chapter had inflated their sense of security to the limit—believing trenches, abatis, barbed wire, SKS rifles, and searchlights constituted the strongest fortress.

County scouts watched from afar daily, carefully never approaching too closely. Companions captured by pirates riding roaring monsters had taught them sufficient lessons. The bravest used trees and grass for cover during daylight, slowly approaching, seeing somewhat what the pirates were busily doing. The county basically understood the pirates' every move—but was helpless. Few could be consulted; discussions were all armchair strategy. The gentry weren't enthusiastic—what was there to fight with? Magistrate Wu knew these old moneybags' thinking: at worst, when crisis came, flee to rural fortresses. *Small chaos, hide in cities; great chaos, hide in the countryside*—a time-tested saying. As county magistrate, if the city fell, he couldn't flee—he'd have to die with the city. This he truly didn't want—if ambition for office hadn't burned so brightly, he wouldn't have gone to such lengths to get appointed to this backwater.

The city wasn't peaceful either. Over 2,000 rural refugees had fled into the county seat. The city didn't have enough housing. Farmers from the four directions had either fled inside the walls; those who hadn't didn't dare bring grain and vegetables into the city, fearing highway robbery by pirates. All foods were scarce. Refugees survived on porridge-kitchen handouts. Malnutrition plus sleeping rough—elderly and children had already died; wailing filled the streets daily. Magistrate Wu was anxious, fearing that any disturbance would trigger civil unrest. So he personally patrolled the streets daily to calm hearts.

Just in case, he'd already secretly dispatched trusted household servants with his family and valuables to the prefectural capital, with instructions to immediately take them home across the strait if anything happened. Thus he became a true "naked official."

After over ten days of terrified waiting, the pirates still showed no sign of attacking. Scouts reported the shaven-headed pirates had stopped building roads at Bairrentou Beach and were now constructing extensively there. They seemed to have no intention of attacking the city. Wu Mingjin couldn't understand what was so special about Bairrentou Beach to warrant all that digging—no legends of ancient tombs or buried treasure.

"This is truly vexing." Wu Mingjin slapped his head. In these ten-odd days, his hair seemed to have grayed considerably.

"Your Honor, Inspector Fu requests an audience." A servant reported.

"Show him in." Wu Mingjin said without enthusiasm. Though he knew Fu Bowen's twelve men couldn't have stopped the pirates' landing, he still harbored resentment over the man's flight without fighting. Still, he could only humor him—the county's only military official, still needed. Fu Bowen apparently understood his grave offense; he'd worked very hard on both city defense and scouting expeditions.

"Your Honor, the shaven-headed pirates are building a fortress at Bairrentou Beach!"

Wu Mingjin's hand shook; tea spilled. He quickly asked: "How do you know?"

"Yesterday I personally scouted. The pirates have already built many houses at Bairren Rapids!"

Wu Mingjin nearly dropped his teacup—this was his worst fear. If the pirates entrenched themselves, what could he do? Previously, he'd hoped the pirates would leave after a while. Now they weren't leaving; they'd built roads; now they were building a settlement less than ten *li* from the county seat.

Once the settlement was complete, the pirates would stay permanently. Setting aside other matters—it was now the ninth month; autumn grain collection was imminent. The Wenlan River's banks were the county's grain-producing heartland. With pirates right there, how would commoners dare harvest?

Failure to collect autumn grain... Magistrate Wu knew this was far more serious than pirates in the county. His official hat was certainly finished.

"Quickly invite Master Liu." Wu Mingjin spun around, ordering: "Summon all city gentry! And Master Huang from Huang Family Village."

The city's officials and gentry, hearing scouts' news at the meeting, included some who'd read military texts. Seeing these shaven-headed pirates spread in a line along the road, they assumed the pirates didn't understand warfare—deploying a "snake formation" where head and tail couldn't support each other. They hadn't built the fortified camp at Bopu. Each post only had two or three men with bird-guns. Only short-clothed, shaven-headed laborers working.

This emboldened the officials and gentry. Fu Bowen, having lost his Bopu post as Patrol Inspector, most actively advocated attacking the pirates to redeem his guilt. Magistrate Wu specifically pointed out that autumn harvest was near; farmers along the river dared not work the fields. Any delay would lose the year's harvest—failing the court above, leaving commoners destitute below, not to mention unpaid rents... The gentry's interest gradually stirred. When self-interest was at stake, they had to be proactive. Some immediately pledged men and money to fight and drive out the pirates.

On the eleventh of the ninth month, all village commanders with militia were summoned to the city to deliberate. Magistrate Wu's wording was extremely stern. With several major local landlords explicitly pledging to fight to the death, smaller forts had to agree to participate—some with three or five men, some contributing weapons or gunpowder. By the thirteenth, nearly 300 militia had gathered. The magistrate still thought it insufficient and sent to Xinhua Township's Li'an in the county's south, conscripting thirty Li-people soldiers from a Li tribal village. These soldiers were crossbowmen armed with poison-tipped arrows prepared with special toxins.

*Jinshi* Liu proposed a night raid; Magistrate Wu agreed. But Inspector Fu and Huang Shoutong both opposed. They had combat experience—knowing that even well-trained regular troops struggled to control advance and retreat in night fighting, let alone this hastily assembled rabble. Being a rabble, the only option was to rely on numbers, massively attacking one pirate position in an overwhelming assault—destroy one group, wreck some vehicles and equipment.

Fu Bowen ordered everyone to bring plenty of fire-starters and gunpowder for burning. Originally, he'd wanted to bring the garrison's Frankish cannon too, but Centurion Sun adamantly refused, claiming the cannon and soldiers were for city defense—field combat was the county's affair, none of his business. Magistrate Wu personally negotiated but was also rebuffed. Deeply disappointed—the messenger to Tang Yunwen at Baisha had also returned: Tang said he was soon joining the campaign against bandit Liu Laoxiang and had no time to deal with these "small-time pirates."

But Tang Yunwen's response was expected. Unless the pirates breached Lingao City, the army wouldn't come suppress them. Now there was nothing but to muster spirits and fight with all their might.

The county scoured the armory to equip these ragged militia; had city blacksmiths forge many iron spearheads; collected scrap copper and iron for cannon shot; conscripted labor to build war-carts... The city became chaotic and noisy.

All these city activities were reported in full by the observation post below the city to the Committee. Whether Lingao was strengthening defenses or preparing a counterattack—no one could determine. Finally, orders to heighten alert were issued, but the Military Group actually had no more forces.

Including mobilized armed militia after landing, the Military Group totaled only about seventy people. Subtracting three at the county monitoring post and two escorting the long-range reconnaissance survey team—the remainder had to guard from Bopu camp through highway checkpoints to the Bairren Rapids site itself. The Military Group had already canceled three-shift duty, adopting two shifts just to barely maintain some security coverage.

Whether this gap-riddled defensive line would be effective against Ming militia—only actual combat could answer. This wasn't a game with LOAD available. Every death, every lost piece of equipment meant irreversible loss.

All news from the observation post indicated: Ming-era Lingao County was about to launch a full-scale attack. This surprised the Committee—they'd assumed the county wouldn't attack without Ming military reinforcement. But on the thirteenth of the ninth lunar month, the observation post spotted people dismounting the *huzhun* cannons from the city tower. This further confirmed the Military Group's assessment. He Ming warned the Committee their security situation was not optimistic. In an emergency meeting, the Committee decided on full mobilization: except for a few ongoing projects, everything halted. All males were issued SKS rifles; all females issued revolvers. The Military Group was to organize live-fire training sessions ASAP.

He Ming knew most had limited training. During crossing preparations, due to restrictions, so-called military training mainly consisted of marching and fitness; live-fire shooting was rare. A novice unfamiliar with shooting holding an SKS was no different from holding a fire-poker. Don't expect them to fight actively or effectively.

After Military Group discussion, they decided to continue using the mobile-defense plan. Once attacked, mobilized militia would fall back to key strongpoints; Military Group soldiers would use farm vehicles and jeeps for mobility. Wherever the enemy concentrated greatest force, the mobile unit would unexpectedly strike from flanks or rear. He Ming believed their superior communications and mobility would powerfully compensate for insufficient numbers.
