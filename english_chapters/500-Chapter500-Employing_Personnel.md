# Chapter 500 - Employing Personnel

What did this indicate? Lin Baiguang thought, either these Brocade Guard officials were law-abiding and hadn't been dragged into the water by the Gou family, or the Gou family thought these people were insignificant and wouldn't hinder their affairs.

Whether it was the former or the latter, Lin Baiguang couldn't be sure. He had no time to attend to it now. He still had many things to arrange.

Next, he began establishing the Qiongzhou Prefecture Intelligence Station. This organization that terrified Ma Benyuan was actually a castle in the air. Lin Baiguang had nothing but a paper plan and three hundred taels of station-building funds approved by the Intelligence Committee.

As for the source of intelligence agents stationed locally, he decided to serve as the station chief himself for now to guide the local work specifically. Many short-term training classes like intelligence work training classes were being held, but the students were generally too young. It was obviously unfeasible to ask such people to take charge of a sector alone.

Lin Baiguang had complaints about the Executive Committee only cultivating native teenagers for key positions. Teenagers certainly had the advantages of strong acceptance and being easily brainwashed, but the result of blindly emphasizing training children was a lack of key cadres who could preside over the big picture in many places. In his view: people's loyalty couldn't be completed by brainwashing alone.

Just as there is no love or hate without reason in this world, there is no loyalty without reason. To make subordinates loyal, enough tangible benefits must be given, they must be roped in psychologically, and preferably an idealistic flag should be raised. With this three-pronged approach, most people could be managed. Loyal hearts didn't necessarily require children to achieve.

The transmigrator group's attitude and practices toward native employees had already formed considerable loyalty. There was only one point Lin Baiguang felt was insufficient: the banner of idealism.

So far, the transmigrator group hadn't proposed a clear ideology. While using the shell of Great Ming as camouflage was convenient and safe, and could offset the "rebellion" concerns of many natives, from a certain angle, it also lost the hope given to ambitious people. In any spacetime, there existed a large group of people dissatisfied with the existing order. They were full of dissatisfaction with reality and eager for change, but they knew clearly that their abilities were not only insufficient to raise a call to arms but even insufficient to be a local tyrant.

If someone could give them such an opportunity, this group would explode with great power to strive for things they couldn't get under the old order. When drinking with surrendered pirates, Lin Baiguang heard them ask more than once what the Australians planned for the future. Almost everyone hoped the Australians would raise the flag and fire the cannon one day to compete for the Central Plains, so they could become founding officials and bring honor to their wives and children.

The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom proclaiming kingships immediately after taking Yong'an felt overly hasty to later generations, but the parties involved really enjoyed the feeling of being generals and ministers, and it fully demonstrated the leadership's determination to "carry the revolution to the end," boosting morale.

The Executive Committee deliberated obscuring their intentions like this was safe, but unfavorable for boosting morale. It easily made everyone fall into a state of petty satisfaction. If the Boss has no ambition, how can he recruit capable people? Oda Nobunaga on the four islands of Japan knew to carve a seal saying "Tenka Fubu" (Spread Military Rule Under Heaven) to stamp everywhere, letting the world know his ambition.

He had to talk with the Executive Committee about this line of thought when he returned and raise the banner of ideology. Also, regarding personnel usage, the current system was too strict—stricter than the Communist Party back in the day—which was unfavorable for carrying out work.

Lin Baiguang's concept of employing people was not sticking to one pattern. No matter what kind of person, as long as they could be used by him, they should be used—of course, the premise was being able to control them. He believed this reflected a leader's skill in using people. He scoffed at the Executive Committee's method of checking if someone was "reliable" and had a "clean history" before doing anything. Of course, he wouldn't tell anyone these views. Just as he never discussed his views on the conduct of certain people in the county committee team with anyone in the past.

For the staffing of the intelligence station in Qiongzhou Prefecture this time, he chose Gao Di.

In terms of seniority, Gao Di could be called a "veteran" among all native employees. He had also served as an intelligence agent in Guangzhou for a period, counting as a senior intelligence officer. He was intelligent and very familiar with street ways, making him an ideal candidate for a spy.

However, this person was too clever and flexible. Coupled with his seniority and different status—legally, he was still Wen Desi's domestic slave. Being a domestic slave, especially the Chairman of the Executive Committee's domestic slave, was a status that allowed one to look down on others. Consequently, he inevitably showed arrogance at times. Naturally, he became an unpopular figure. After returning from a business trip to Foshan with Huang Tianyu and Liu San, although the trip timely exposed Qianqian's true colors, earning him merit and commendation, he was quietly "sidelined" in the department. No missions were assigned, and he had no share in training. He looked a bit depressed for a while.

Lin Baiguang believed Gao Di had the talent to be an intelligence officer, and his loyalty wasn't bad. Ending up like this was simply due to arrogance and high self-esteem, incurring others' jealousy. Such people were very motivated to work; as long as plenty of medals and commendations were issued, he would risk his life.

Lin Baiguang believed Gao Di had more drive than other natives and had to be utilized. The reason was precisely that his family "followed the dragon" earliest, but now fared far worse than latecomers: his parents were just ordinary commune members when they arrived in Lingao, assigned to work in various places daily by the production team leader. Later, through Xiao Zishan's arrangement, they were transferred to the small kitchen to work. His sister had some success, but wasn't Wang Luobin's life secretary. Clearly, this was a great stimulus to Gao Di.

As for the other one, it was Chen Tong, Gao Di's companion during the trip to Foshan. Chen Tong was a top student in the first term of the intelligence work study class and had been interning at the Intelligence Committee. He was an elite element in the future intelligence front that everyone looked upon favorably.

Elite or fanatic, Lin Baiguang planned to use Qiongzhou Prefecture as a stage to test their actual working abilities.

He returned to his dwelling in the temple, where Chen Tong and Gao Di were waiting for him. When Lin Baiguang went out, he deliberately didn't tell them what to do and gave each of them one tael of silver as pocket money.

Qiongzhou Prefecture was a much more bustling world of flowers and wine than Lingao. They were both fifteen or sixteen-year-old teenagers, naturally at an active age. Having money and free time, whether they could hold themselves back and wait quietly in the temple for his return was a simple test.

Obviously, both had enough patience to wait for him to return and issue orders. Lin Baiguang called them into his room.

The first thing was to get a dwelling for the intelligence station. This Qiongzhou Prefecture Intelligence Station had to exist for at least three or four years; it couldn't rely on renting rooms in a temple. There had to be a secure base.

Qiewei already had an inn here, but Lin Baiguang decided not to incorporate Qiewei's branch into the intelligence network. If the intelligence station were destroyed, the negative impact on Qiewei would be too great and affect its operations elsewhere. Moreover, the transmigrator group hadn't achieved full controlling interest in Qiewei yet, so many things couldn't be known to them.

As for using the Runshitang Pharmacy brand, although it was almost completely controlled by the Health Department, the reality that Runshitang was a Lingao shop couldn't be avoided. Using its name would arouse suspicion among those already vigilant against "Lingao"—also inappropriate.

He decided to acquire existing houses locally for use.

"Gao Di, go find a way to get a house. Renting or buying are both fine," Lin Baiguang said. "It will be used for the intelligence station in the future."

Gao Di often rolled in the market in Guangzhou, so doing such things was originally easy. But he was a Guangzhou native, so speaking here marked him as an outsider. The bad habit of bullying outsiders was the same everywhere in the past and present, not to mention that "house brokers" involved in real estate were mostly tough old scoundrels. Whether Gao Di could handle it depended on his ability.

"Yes, Chief." Gao Di asked, "What is the budget? How large a scale? Any special requirements?"

"The budget isn't much, only one hundred taels." Lin Baiguang said. "This is a house for the future intelligence station. What kind of house to choose is up to you."

Lin Baiguang believed that finding a house for an intelligence station required not just eloquence and skill in dealing with people. One also needed vision—only by having a comprehensive consideration of the upcoming intelligence work could one find a suitable house. This was a test of the kid's ability.

"Whether buying, pawning, or renting a house, it can't be solved in a day or two," Gao Di said. "It will take about ten days..."

"I leave the matter of getting a house to you. You have full authority to handle it. Here is twenty taels of silver for your activity funds these days." Lin Baiguang deliberately didn't give him any instructions. Hands off completely.

If Gao Di botched it, it would at most waste some silver. Appointing the wrong person would have much more serious consequences. The role people played in intelligence work was simply too great.

"Yes, I'll go check the market right away."

After assigning the house-buying task, he then instructed Chen Tong to inquire about a person.

"This person is named Hai Shuzu, a local from a prominent family. Go find out the details of his family situation." Saying this, he gave him twenty taels of silver. "This is your activity fund."

"I'll go right away." Chen Tong nodded earnestly and took the silver.

Hai Shuzu was from a prominent local clan; the Hai family was very famous here. Inquiring about his situation wouldn't cost much money. However, intelligence came in generic goods and precious insider information. This depended on Chen Tong's ability to collect intelligence.

"I'll give you ten days."
