# Chapter 1802 - The Merchants' Concerns

"Whether we exchange, whether we accept—none of that really matters. No matter the purity, it's still silver. If the common folk accept it, this could well be a benefit to both the nation and the people. If they don't, that's not our fault to bear." Gao Ju said.

"But this purity..."

"The purity can be managed. Our silver isn't full-fineness treasury silver either—and as for the common folk's silver, that's never been up to standard. The real question is these pieces of paper that can't be melted in a crucible—now *those* require some thought." As he spoke, Gao Ju patted the wooden box beside him—an exquisitely crafted fine-woodwork case with a flat, squared profile. This was the box the Australians had distributed to hold the "currency samples."

Everyone naturally understood what Master Gao meant: the "Australian Treasure Notes."

Treasure notes, money tickets, cash tokens—these were nothing new to China's merchants. The Song, Jin, and Yuan dynasties had all maintained relatively mature paper currency issuance systems. The Southern Song's paper currency issuance and circulation in particular could be considered miraculous in the history of Chinese finance—with only half the realm, the Southern Song had sustained over a century of tribute payments and war expenditures, demonstrating truly masterful fiscal and financial prowess. By the Yuan dynasty, paper currency had become the basic medium of exchange.

At the end of the Yuan, the currency system collapsed and paper money depreciated catastrophically. Yet the influence and credit of paper currency among the populace persisted. When Zhu Yuanzhang took the throne, he banned copper coin circulation and restored paper currency wholesale, encountering no great resistance. After all, the common people were not strangers to paper currency, and Zhu Yuanzhang's decision to use it was naturally connected to his own experience living under Yuan rule. To him, this seemed perfectly normal.

The Great Ming Treasure Notes had no reserve backing—not an insurmountable problem in itself. Paper currency backed by governmental authority, as long as it could gain market acceptance and circulate, and as long as depreciation was kept within certain bounds, was not unacceptable. Throughout the entire Republican era, over a hundred varieties of paper currency circulated across China, most with questionable reserves and none particularly stable in value, yet they managed to circulate for years.

However, the Great Ming Treasure Notes were born in an era when the Ming government lacked effective grassroots administrative capacity, and rural areas had not yet been fully penetrated by the market economy as they would be in the late Qing and Republican periods. Zhu Yuanzhang's fundamental misunderstanding of paper currency led the court to view banknotes as a means of "creating something from nothing" for revenue extraction. His one-time gift of 300,000 strings of extremely high-denomination notes to Zhu Di illustrated his ignorance of monetary policy. The reckless overprinting caused hyperinflation, and the government's discriminatory treatment of its own "legal tender"—accepting it only at a few customs posts nationwide while refusing it for tax payments—was an extraordinary policy that effectively announced the issuer's own distrust of the currency. This was perhaps unprecedented in the history of monetary issuance.

Self-discrimination combined with unrestrained overprinting caused the Great Ming Treasure Notes to depreciate and wither continuously on the market until they finally withdrew from circulation, leaving behind nothing but a reputation for "invented pretexts and exploiting the people." Though some literati accounts claimed the Notes were "market-boycotted" by distrustful merchants and collapsed in short order, they actually limped along until the Zhengde reign, though by then their value and circulation had become negligible.

The merchants gathered in this shop had mostly never witnessed the Treasure Notes in circulation, but they had heard tales from their elders. Now, hearing Gao Ju mention the "Australian Circulation Vouchers," their hearts instinctively clenched—compared to Australian silver dollars, their concern for this paper currency ran deeper still.

After the Treasure Notes withdrew from the market, similar cash tickets, silver drafts, the bills of exchange used by foreign merchants, and even the "money chips" of Jiangnan—these men had all encountered in varying degrees. But these instruments were mostly promissory notes or bills of exchange in nature.

The new circulation vouchers everyone had already seen. Compared to the old vouchers they had encountered in the past, the new notes were slightly larger, though considerably smaller than the cash tickets and silver drafts commonly seen. The old vouchers had already been quite refined; these new ones were even more exquisite. The paper was crisp and substantial, with an indescribable pleasure to the touch.

Unlike the silver dollars, which came in only three denominations, the paper notes came in many varieties—not only three equivalent silver dollar exchange vouchers but also several small-denomination fractional notes. Each had its own design, all beautifully made.

How to convert them had been explained at the meeting, and detailed illustrated instructions were included in the sample box. Anyone literate could easily understand. Moreover, the Australian currency system used a simple decimal conversion.

"This paper is extremely durable—what kind of paper could it be?"

"Probably mulberry-bark paper," someone ventured.

"How could mulberry-bark paper achieve such smooth evenness?"

...

"Stop arguing—only the Australians can make this paper. It's their secret technique," murmured Old Huo, the head of the paper guild, in a low voice. The paper trade had been among the earliest struck and subsequently most tightly controlled by Australian goods. Years ago, Australian paper had flooded into Guangzhou, from high to low grades, forcing nearly all the large and small paper workshops in Guangzhou Prefecture to close. Only the distribution channels survived—barely—because the Australians needed middlemen. Now the paper guild traded mostly in specialty papers from other regions; the majority of their stock came from co-op branches in Hong Kong.

Beyond the paper, the designs and patterns were also a hundred times more complex than the old vouchers. The merchants present all understood the key point: the finest engravers in all of Guangdong could not produce such plates—not even if you summoned the Ministry of Works' official artisans from the capital who engraved official documents and certificates.

"So these circulation vouchers cannot be counterfeited," someone observed.

"Precisely so," said Liang Chenlong, head of the currency guild, slowly. Given that the currency reform affected the money trade most directly, the guild's large and small operators had already held a closed-door meeting before gathering at Jufeng to discuss countermeasures. Opinions had flown back and forth, but no strategy had emerged—they could only "wait and see which way the wind blows." In truth, the advantages of the Australians' new currency were plain to everyone in the trade.

"All of us here are businessmen. Every day we deal with silver and copper cash. Every day we receive payments that require assessing silver purity, distinguishing good coins from bad. Even with all that care, we still often take in low-grade silver and worthless coins." The men nodded. The effort shops put into verifying currency was considerable indeed. Silver had to be assessed and weighed; copper cash had to be examined for color and heft. Inevitably there would be disputes with customers. If one encountered an unreasonable patron, even greater trouble ensued. And there were ruffians and scoundrels who specialized in passing off debased silver and bad coins to "charge" various shops. If you missed it and accepted such currency, you simply swallowed the loss. But if you spotted it and objected, they would immediately cause a scene at your door, and you would end up paying to make them go away.

Even with such vigilance, inventories invariably turned up lead slugs, low-grade alloys, and worthless shell-thin coins. And when sending loose silver to the assay shop for recasting into ingots, you'd have another round of disputes over purity. In short, the aggravation was beyond description.

"Now the Australians bring out their silver dollars. Whatever the purity, one dollar is one dollar, half a dollar is half a dollar. As long as nothing's missing or clipped, everyone must accept it. That's the advantage right there. If this can be implemented, it would be an enormous benefit to commoners and merchants alike." Liang Chenlong stroked his beard. "However, the Australians also have treasure notes. That is cause for concern."

"The small-denomination fractional vouchers—let's set those aside for now," Liang continued. "Currently, copper cash is in short supply, and what circulates is mostly debased private or official coin. These paper tickets aren't much different—using paper is actually more convenient. But these silver dollar circulation vouchers..."

His face took on a worried expression. His hesitant manner immediately stirred everyone's anxieties.

That paper notes would circulate at par with silver dollars was nothing novel to Ming merchants. Since China first had paper currency in circulation, notes had theoretically exchanged at par with copper cash. The *jiaozi* of the Song and the Treasure Notes of the Ming were all denominated in *wen* and *guan*. But in actual use, the *wen* and *guan* on paper never matched up with copper coins. Buying a few bowls of cloudy wine with notes worth dozens or hundreds of *guan* was common practice in the Ming.

But now these circulation vouchers corresponded not to copper cash but to real silver—and were supposed to be exchangeable at face value. Naturally the merchants felt apprehensive. First, did the Australians even have enough silver dollars for equal-value exchange? Anyone with the slightest understanding of finance would inevitably consider this question. While Ming merchants weren't versed in financial theory, they understood overissuance. Consider the various "shop tickets" issued by individual stores—essentially modern gift cards—these were often overissued. If someone collected the full amount and demanded redemption, many shops would instantly face a run and bankruptcy.

That was secondary. What worried the merchants more was that the Australians might have no intention of maintaining the currency's value at all: might they not flood the market with circulation vouchers, buy up all the silver, then leave behind a pile of paper notes to depreciate as they pleased? Though they hadn't personally experienced this tactic, ancestral lore had told them of it. It was precisely how the Great Yuan had drained the Central Plains of gold and silver.

When all was said and done, circulation vouchers—however beautifully printed—were just paper. How could they compare to solid gold and silver? Even golden-yellow, blue-green quality copper cash felt more substantial in the hand than these pretty slips of paper.

"If they issued only silver dollars without these silver dollar vouchers, that would be the greatest of benevolent policies. Our guild, large and small alike, would certainly cooperate with all our strength." Liang Chenlong twirled his beard. "As for the fractional vouchers—with small cash in such short supply—using them alongside copper coins would be acceptable."

Everyone understood his meaning. The currency guild had with these words essentially set the tone for the meeting. All eyes turned to Gao Ju.
