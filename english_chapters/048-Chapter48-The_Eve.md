# Chapter 48 - The Eve

Chapter 48 The Eve

On the sea, the Fengcheng cut through the waves.

Most people gathered on the deck, looking at the wormhole generator at the bow.

It was a huge ring device, emitting a faint blue light. Under the operation of Wen Desi, the light became brighter and brighter, and the air around it began to distort.

"Energy level 50%... 70%... 90%..." The operator reported the data nervously.

"Stable." Wen Desi stared at the instrument panel, sweat dripping from his forehead.

Crossing with such a huge ship and so many people was unprecedented. Any small mistake could lead to catastrophe.

"Enter the alert state!" Xi Yazhou ordered.

The soldiers of the military group lay prone on the ship's rail, pointing their guns at the sea surface, guarding against possible enemies (or sea monsters).

Suddenly, the light of the wormhole burst out, forming a huge vortex with a diameter of tens of meters.

"It's open! It's open!" Everyone cheered.

"Full speed ahead!" Wen Desi shouted.

The Fengcheng accelerated and rushed towards the vortex.

At the moment of entering the vortex, everyone felt a dizzy sensation. The scenery in front of them became blurred and distorted, as if entering a kaleidoscope.

Time seemed to stop at this moment.

I don't know how long it took, the feeling of dizziness disappeared. The vision became clear again.

They saw a strange starry sky and a dark sea surface.

"We... have we crossed?" Someone asked softly.

"Check the coordinates!" Wen Desi ordered.

"Report! GPS signal lost! Satellite phone no signal!"

"Report! Radio only has noise!"

"Success!" Wen Desi breathed a sigh of relief, "We have left the 21st century."

"Where is this?"

"Look there!" Someone pointed to the distance.

In the distance, a faint light could be seen. It was the lighthouse of Lingao Cape (wait, there was no lighthouse in Ming Dynasty, maybe signal fire or just the outline).

"That is Lingao Cape!" Wen Desi confirmed, "We have arrived at the destination!"

Cheers erupted on the deck again. People hugged and wept, celebrating their rebirth.

However, the carnival didn't last long.

"Alert! Unknown target ahead!" The lookout shouted.

Everyone's nerves tightened again.

Under the illumination of the searchlight, a small wooden boat appeared on the sea surface.

It was an ancient fishing boat. Several fishermen in ragged clothes were looking at this steel behemoth in horror.

"Don't shoot!" Wen Desi stopped the soldiers who were about to fire, "They are ordinary people."

He picked up the loudspeaker and shouted in Lingao dialect (learned from Xiong Buyou): "Fellow folks, don't be afraid. We are passing merchants..."

The fishermen didn't seem to understand, or were too scared. They rowed desperately, trying to escape.

"Let them go." Wen Desi waved his hand.

The Fengcheng continued to move forward and finally anchored in Bopu Harbor.

This was the first night of the Transmigrators in the new world.

Few people could sleep. They sat on the deck, blowing the sea breeze, looking at the strange stars, thinking about the future.

"What will happen tomorrow?"

"Who knows. But it will definitely be interesting."
