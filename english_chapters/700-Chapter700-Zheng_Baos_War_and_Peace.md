# Chapter 700 - Zheng Bao's War and Peace

In his disappointment, Zheng Bao still gave Wang You the title of advisor—at least Wang You had skills in managing documents and accounts, and Zheng Bao lacked such talent. Subsequently, he led his recruited ships and wealth to operate in the coastal waters near Dianbai, robbing salt boats and coastal residents. He also ran to Vietnamese waters to participate in several maritime conflicts between the Northern and Southern Dynasties, reaping considerable benefits. Upon hearing that Liu Xiang's fleet had left the Pearl River Estuary, he hurriedly led his fleet to Lantau Island, preparing to seize this opening to rush into the Pearl River for a big score.

After arriving at Lantau, he discovered many small pirate bands had already gathered sporadically, all preparing to rush into the Pearl River's inland waterways for a big operation. The government army's disastrous defeat at Chengmai and Liu Xiang's sudden departure from the Pearl River Estuary gave them great hope for wealth.

After Zheng Bao arrived at Lantau, he used his strength to quickly consolidate all the ships there. Now this temporarily assembled group had expanded to a scale of 70 large ships, over 200 sampans and long-dragon boats, and more than 4,000 pirates.

Just as Zheng Bao was waiting for suitable tides and winds to rush into the Pearl River Estuary in one go, news of the Australian fleet's arrival made him temporarily dismiss this idea.

The Australians building a pier on Hong Kong Island showed their intention to stay there permanently. Moreover, they had dispatched many ships. Zheng Bao thought: if he didn't establish an alliance with them, once his fleet entered the Pearl River, it would be very bad if the Australians took advantage of the fire to rob him at the estuary.

Either achieve an alliance with the Australians and split the loot. He was willing even if he had to bleed a little more profit; or, thoroughly defeat this Australian fleet so they wouldn't dare grab territory.

It was under such consideration that Zheng Bao sent Jin Caifa. Besides probing the Australians' intentions, there was also the intent to gather military intelligence. Especially to find out clearly whether the Australians' most formidable "fast ships" without sails had come.

He carefully asked his two trusted aides about the number of Australian ships, the number of cannons equipped on ships, and how many defenders were on shore. Hearing that the fast ships hadn't come, he breathed a sigh of relief; hearing that the Australians had over fifty ships anchored, he sighed with regret. If only there were just ten or twenty! Although most Australian warships looked no different from ships of Guangdong and Fujian, their sailing speed and firepower were far unmatched by local ships. Grand Manager Zhu had set his sights on their "fast ships" and planned to send people specifically to seize them. Who knew their sailing ships were also so effective!

Especially the "quick-firing guns" on their sailing ships; once firing started, the sea surface would instantly be filled with water columns, wiping out enemy sailors from one or two hundred *zhang* away. With such divine weapons, one need not worry about dominating the seas.

Zheng Bao had been itching with this idea. In his view, although the Australian great cannons were rumored to be excellent, they were nothing more than another version of the Red Barbarian Cannons. Such cannons were expensive and heavy, and could explode themselves in battle. The best were still those "quick-firing guns" that shot far, accurately, and rapidly. If he could get a few and mount them on his ships, he could sweep away enemies.

"Advisor Wang!" Zheng Bao greeted Wang You hurriedly as he entered the cabin.

"These bald bandits talk big!" Zheng Bao, having had smooth sailing since becoming a pirate, couldn't swallow this insult. "To actually demand we register our troops and ships and send it over—isn't this damn well surrendering? Even if we were joining a big gang, they shouldn't humiliate people like this!"

Wang You looked silently at this "Boss." Zheng Bao wasn't stupid—Zheng Bao was cunning and cruel, but unfortunately only at the peak level of a local tyrant. In insight and talent, he wasn't on the same level as Zhucailao and others; even Black Flag Fourth Brother, a secondary manager, was much stronger than him.

Pity! Zhucailao had died in battle at Nanri, and his managers were either dead or surrendered. He himself had fallen to being an advisor for such a character. Wang You was very unwilling.

Not to mention anything else, just coming to the Pearl River Estuary. Wang You believed this was seeking death. The Pearl River Estuary basin would definitely be the focus of the next struggle between Liu Xiang and the Lingao Australian group—a place everyone else avoided, how could a small band like theirs lightly wade into muddy waters? Besides, this was originally Liu Xiang's territory. Although Liu Xiang's main force had moved to Fujian waters, it didn't mean he would hand over this territory.

Zheng Bao's actions, in Wang You's view, offended both sides. In the end, he would surely come to a bad end.

But Zheng Bao felt smug. Wearing the titles of the Great Le Dynasty's Marquis of Guiyi and General of Ninghai, he felt like a "high official," using various garish, neither-Ming-nor-Le things for clothing, flags, and insignia. This made Wang You despise him greatly.

But for now, he could only endure silently. Zheng Bao both needed to use and distrusted the former subordinates of Zhucailao, spending much effort to divide and guard against them. Wang You knew his prestige was highest among Zhucailao's old subordinates, and Zheng Bao watched him extremely closely. Any carelessness could lead to an inexplicable "falling into water and drowning."

"Advisor Wang, tell me, is this bald bandit matter feasible? It seems they want to swallow the Pearl River Estuary territory all for themselves," Zheng Bao said indignantly.

Wang You coughed. The Australians arriving at the Pearl River Estuary and building a fortress on Hong Kong Island made their intentions clear at a glance. Zheng Bao actually had few choices: either make enemies with the Australians and fight, or hoist sails and leave.

In his opinion, leaving was the best choice for the Zheng Bao group—even if the Australians had half as many ships, the Zheng Bao group could absolutely not be the Australians' match. Without overwhelming numerical superiority, defeating the Australians was impossible.

Wang You had just spoken a few reasons for "not suitable for war" when he noticed impatience on Zheng Bao's face—Zheng Bao obviously didn't plan to just walk away. Moreover, he had designs on the Australian ships and cannons.

"I say Old Wang, you're afraid of wolves in front and tigers behind. Where did that boldness under Grand Manager Zhu go?" Zheng Bao patted his shoulder and laughed loudly. "No matter how strong the Australians are, they only have forty or fifty ships, and no fast iron ships. I see they're about the same as our ships. Their firearms are fierce, so I'll tell the brothers to stick close and board them, drowning them if need be!"

He said confidently: "Speaking of powerful ships and cannons, of course the Australians are strong. But when discussing blades, spears, and kung fu, our Chinese martial arts are the most powerful. As long as we get on board, whether they are true baldies or fake baldies, once firearms can't be used on deck, aren't they just waiting for us to chop them down?"

"I fear it's not that simple."

"Then tell me, what difficulties are there?"

Wang You thought, leaving aside how to get men onto the decks, with dozens of Australian ships anchored there, people on board couldn't all be deaf and blind, waiting for enemies to climb up ship by ship.

"Even if we capture a few ships, if other ships discover it and besiege us together, wouldn't it be all for nothing?"

"Hmm, what you say makes sense." Zheng Bao thought about it and agreed. But he immediately had a second idea:

The second idea was capturing the bandits by capturing their king. Zheng Bao planned to select a hundred daredevils from the pirates, promising heavy rewards. Each would conceal a sharp blade. Then they would pretend to go submit, and assassinate the Australian big leader in front of the tent.

According to Jin Caifa and others' descriptions, although there were guards around the Australian big tent, there were only forty or fifty. Zheng Bao believed that as long as seventy or eighty men entangled them, the rest could rush in and kill all the leaders inside.

Wang You didn't know whether to laugh or cry—this plan was more realistic than the previous one, but the probability of success assumed the Australians were all idiots who would allow a hundred sturdy men to casually approach their command center without searching them beforehand.

Then Zheng Bao proposed several more "stratagems." All were rejected by Wang You one by one.

"If the Grand Manager is dead set on making enemies with the Australians to get their ships and cannons, there is only one word."

"What?"

"Wait." Wang You nodded. "The Australians' strength is roughly equal to ours. If we rashly provoke hostilities, even if we win, it will be a pyrrhic victory. For now, we can only act according to circumstances, watch the Australians' moves, and then make plans."

Actually, it meant doing nothing and waiting for an opportunity. Zheng Bao complained: "Wait until when? When can we enter the Pearl River?"

"Entering the Pearl River is easy, but if the matter with the Australians isn't settled properly, there will be endless trouble!"

"Hmm, you have a point!" Zheng Bao certainly didn't wish to charge into the Pearl River Estuary alone with such a fleet left behind him.

"This brother has a method." Jin Caifa, seeing a chance to interject, hurried to speak.

"What method?"

Like presenting a treasure, he told Zheng Bao and Wang You about encountering Shi Shisi on the Hong Kong pier.

"...Shi Shisi is dressed like an Australian now. If I hadn't dealt with him back then, I really wouldn't have recognized that Australian was Shi Shisi."

Zheng Bao became interested: "Oh, what official position does he hold with the Australians now? How many ships does he manage?"

"I didn't dare ask. He was far away, on a ship at the pier." Jin Caifa said. "With this connection, the Grand Manager's business has hope."

Wang You understood immediately: "You intend to buy him over?"

"Exactly!" Jin Caifa said. "As the saying goes, men die for wealth, birds die for food. That Shi Shisi was just a secondary manager of a small band back then. Even under the Australians, he likely hasn't become a grand manager, probably controlling only five or six ships. As long as the Grand Manager is willing to offer heavy gold, he can't help but be tempted."

Whether getting him to bring his troops over or launching a surprise turncoat attack during battle, both were excellent opportunities. Zheng Bao's eyes lit up.
