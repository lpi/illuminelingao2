# Chapter 2643: Temple Festival Opera (Part 1)

Passing a few days, Opera Troupe arrived as agreed. Li Family Enclosure became more lively. Puppet Troupe already sang for quite a few days. This time could only step back yielding worthiness first, yielding threshing ground to new coming Opera Troupe.

Actors sang opera yi yi ya ya. This was not Cantonese Opera, not Right Tune sung in Mandarin either. But a kind of Earth Opera (Local Opera) Tea-picking Opera (*Cai Cha Xi*) popular in Northern Guangdong Southern Jiangxi places. This kind of opera between Grand Opera and Small Singing, sang in dialect, singing and dancing, form lively. Also had certain story plot. Quite loved by villagers common people.

Since Li Family Enclosure had Puppet Troupe coming to perform, it became literary entertainment center of this belt. Folks of surrounding ten *li* eight townships all came to watch. Puppet Show big guys watched somewhat tired. Recently changed new flower pattern again, people coming were more.

People were business opportunity. Crowd gathering was having "Living Water." Merchants followed "Living Water" swarming into Li Family Enclosure doing business one after another.

Peddlers wandering various villages shouldered shoulder poles. One end hung a lantern, one end inserted a rattle drum. While following sound of rattle drum shuttling in crowd, while hawking own business. Selling brushing goods, selling snacks, selling medicine, selling picture books... Coming early propped up stall under nearby trees borrowing light of torches lanterns on threshing ground. Shaking drum greeting tourists. For a time, small Li Family Enclosure didn't lose to bustling liveliness of Xiaoyao Market.

Golden Pig also squeezed tightly in crowd, looking around everywhere.

Today early morning, a steward of Patriarch family came to find Golden Pig. Said these two days seeing Golden Pig building stage working counted as strenuous. Patriarch family decided to Long Term Hire Golden Pig. Just wanted to put name in Eight Immortals Society too, counted as Corpsman (*Tuan Ding*). Usually drilling fist foot besides, followed Patriarch family doing some fragmented heavy work. Remuneration besides a share due for being Corpsman, Patriarch family opened another subsidy. Working well had other reward. And also said if Golden Pig had known four countryside idlers introduced over, Master Family as long as looking passable all hired together.

These few days Mother Li continuously nagged Golden Pig to stay more days at home. Don't go to Xiaoyao Market to do odd jobs when getting free. Taking advantage of talisman water begged from Fairy Aunt Huang, "Cultivate" (*Geng Yun*) more at home, good to leave a descendant for Li Family.

Now having such a job not needing to go far door, Golden Pig naturally agreed with one mouth. That day followed steward busy for a day. Until eating finish dinner getting leisure, Golden Pig then thought of Tian Yingcheng.

Tian Family days were not wide either. In village was Outer Surname again. Good thing not turning to, bad thing always taking shift. Home although had a few tenths (*fen*) Mulberry Base, income basically couldn't reach expenses of whole family. Ordinary days still had to rely on working short term jobs to subsidize. Therefore pitied each other with Golden Pig this "Fake Own Family." Two walked very close. Often supported each other. Two families' emotion not bad.

Therefore this time having such good errand, Golden Pig thought of helping Tian Family also recommend a bit. Go to be a Corpsman, get a share of money grain. Better than Tian Yingcheng now relying on working short term job for people to pass days.

These few days all making noise of Temple Festival Opera. People of Li Family Enclosure didn't go far door. Tian Yingcheng should be resting at home. He decided to go to Tian Family first. See if this partner willing to go to Master Family to do this long work together.

Last time going to Tian family to say joy for Tian family wife returning, Golden Pig originally thought his wife couldn't bear poverty running with people. Recently two years Flower Patting (*Pai Hua*) abduction selling matters rarely heard. After Australians came, as long as catching Flower Patter was a Death word. implicated people helping transport, dragging matchmaker, accommodating, implicated buyer, all received implication. A household in Li Family Enclosure just because bought a child from kidnapper hand, finally whole family exiled to what "Taiwan." Now probably dead bones all turned into mud.

When Tian family wife missing, he also went to console Tian Yingcheng before, calling him no need to be sad. After Australians came days much better to pass. Saving few years money marrying a new one also had hope.

Didn't expect, recently Tian Yingcheng's wife actually came back. Not only came back, complexion also very good. Not only complexion good, clothing bright new, also brought back quite some objects. Everyone said behind back, Tian Yingcheng's head scarf probably was green oily oily.

Tian Yingcheng instead didn't get angry. Frivolous people originally counting on seeing Tian family noisy quarreling more or less somewhat disappointed. Still old people said correctly: Tian family so poor, his wife able to come back counted as walking dog shit luck (lucky), still haggling what head scarf green or not.

He going to say joy was one aspect. Another aspect originally wanted to discuss with Tian Yingcheng to partner going out to do some loose jobs after Temple Festival Opera—for them didn't exist any "Slack Farming Season," nothing more than doing work in village during busy farming, going to town to work during slack farming.

Because heard in county jobs more. But he in past never went to county to do work. A person going doing more or less somewhat timid. Wanted to pull Tian Yingcheng to go together. Because Tian Yingcheng's wife had a relative making living at City Gate (*Cheng Guan*). More or less had a care.

Pity at that time full room of people, messy. Golden Pig just said joy to Tian Yingcheng then left. Later heard Tian family sister-in-law prepared to do business in village. He also wanted to take this to ask Tian Yingcheng's plan afterwards.

Who knew this time arriving at Tian family, Tian family was chaotic. Tian family old mother, wife implicated several kids all busy packing objects, packing clothes. A look of packing objects preparing to move house. Golden Pig greatly surprised. Busily asked Tian Yingcheng what is this doing?

Tian Yingcheng didn't hide either. Own wife lost this time, fortunate to get Australians' taking in. Did work for a few days in a Silk Warehouse opened by Australians in county. Australians were very satisfied with her. Heard she was Li Family Enclosure person, then called her to come down countryside to promote Australian Silkworm Eggs and Mulberry Branches.

"This matter I also heard. Saying Sister-in-law is selling Australian Silkworm Eggs." Golden Pig nodded said, "Since selling silkworm eggs, naturally wanting to stay in village can sell. Why wanting to leave?"

"Sigh, you don't know..." Tian Yingcheng low voice said, "She this selling Mulberry Strip Silkworm Egg, didn't it violate taboo?"

Golden Pig still somewhat confused. Because his family poor, so no capital to raise silkworm. Also no Mulberry Base. Ignorant towards trade inside here.

"Li Family Enclosure here silkworm eggs, always belong to Master Li family to sell..."

"Oh, oh, right, right, is such a matter!" Golden Pig suddenly realized, "Right, also Mulberry Leaf. As long as tenanting his land, all have to sell to his family first..."

This down he understood. Tian Sister-in-law wanted to sell silkworm egg mulberry strip, that didn't become snatching meat to eat in Master Li's mouth? He immediately turned pale from shock: This woman too rash!

Couldn't help saying: "You didn't tidy her up well a meal! Not wanting life?!"

Tian Yingcheng smiled bitterly: "Where I dare! She came receiving Kun... Australians' order. While is Master Li, while is Australian. Which one I dare offend! I tell you..."

Few days ago, Patriarch family sent a steward coming to say to him. His wife was bewildered soul by Kun Thieves using demon art. Fully saying some ghost words. Let him discipline own wife well. Don't speak blindly move blindly again. Otherwise, call Fairy Huang to cast spell catching demon. At that time don't blame Master Li not talking feelings between villages.

Tian Family originally in Li Family Enclosure was Outer Surname. Hearing steward's words, Tian Family old and young all panicked spirit. Tian Yingcheng's old mother then scolded Tian Sister-in-law a meal. Saying she "Disaster Provoking Spirit." Tian Sister-in-law also panicked spirit. Whole family discussed down, this Li Family Enclosure temporarily had no way to stay down again. His woman also said: Australians promised her, if couldn't do down in Li Family Enclosure, entering city to throw to Australians was fine. Australians could make other arrangement for them.

Tian Yingcheng heard woman saying Kun Thieves' various conducts and benefits of doing work for them. Moved heart. His family also didn't have any field property. Several tenths Mulberry Base were also tenanted. Li Family Enclosure here actually didn't have anything good to yearn for either. Self a shoulder's strength, arriving under Australians hand same had a bowl of rice to eat. Wife also could have a errand to do. Stronger than staying here much.

"...Thinking coming thinking going, now can only go to city to throw to Australians. Anyhow also have a bowl of rice to eat." Tian Yingcheng said, "Your Sister-in-law said Australians place treatment uot bad. How about you also go to county to do work for Australians together."

Golden Pig now had Corpsman errand, naturally not willing to leave home. Immediately said self already became Corpsman, had a fixed errand. Home still had old mother and wife. didn't want to go too far.

Tian Yingcheng didn't advise much either. Just low voice said: "Golden Pig! You and I brothers once. You are Li family person. Being a Corpsman also counts as a good errand. Just recently these days, Master Li got an Eight Immortals Society making noise in village. I look somewhat evil natured. You must be careful. Government most dreads this..."

This words spoke into Golden Pig's heart pit. He didn't feel this Eight Immortals Society god god ghost ghost suspicious, but various Kung Fu methods practiced after Eight Immortals Society came were all used on battle array. Also called Corpsmen all learn fist foot. What was this planning to do? Now four countrysides peaceful. Bandits all exterminated completely. Occasionally bad people appearing also didn't need so many Corpsmen to cope. Furthermore Eight Immortals Society teaching were all methods of avoiding gun bullets cannon balls—where did bad people have this many firearms?

He dared not think into deep. Just so-called Thinking Carefully Extremely Terrible (*Xi Si Ji Kong*).

But this Corpsman errand indeed tempting. He also couldn't bear to abandon. Always felt Master Li having such big family business, always not likely to faint head.

Immediately hesitated saying: "Little Brother also feels so. But I am no more than left right tiny Corpsman. Sky collapsing having tall person propping. Where needing Little Brother."

Tian Yingcheng said: "Truly living not down, come to county to throw to Old Brother is fine. Always have a bowl of rice to eat!"

Golden Pig silently nodded. Said a few sentences again. Upon leaving, Tian Family wife gave some fragmented Australian objects to him again. Said mutually leaving a thought.

Exiting Tian Family door, Golden Pig raised head looking at sky color. Tonight moon color dim. Moon hidden deeply in thick clouds. Not leaking half fen color. Stars flashing one flickering shuttling in cloud layer playing hide and seek. Additionally a big star faintly emitting threads of red light, shaking one swing in mid-air.

He heart uneasy. Returning home, saw Old Mother and Lian Niang not at home. Probably went to watch Temple Festival Opera. Planed to first go near stage to find. Finishing watching Temple Festival Opera together then go home.
