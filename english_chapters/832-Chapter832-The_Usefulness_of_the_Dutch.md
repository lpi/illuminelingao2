# Chapter 832: The Usefulness of the Dutch

Although it was only February, the temperature had already begun to rise. Skaed thought they needed to have the geothermal air conditioning installed by this summer. Of course, to seek benefits for the administrative departments, one first had to solve the copper problem—no matter how simple the structure of geothermal air conditioning, the heat exchangers and such still needed copper. Though the quantity wasn't large, it was a non-productive, non-essential consumption. The motion to install geothermal air conditioning in the Senator apartments last time had also been stillborn due to opposition from the Planning Institute. Only reserved installation positions were left in the end.

Where to find copper? Currently, the only place they could obtain it in large quantities was Japanese copper purchased from Guangdong. Skaed had a belly full of opinions about the Japanese copper imported from Guangdong—Japanese copper bars could have silver refined from them, which had kept the price of Japanese copper high for a long time. The Trade Department's large-scale purchases only fueled the price increase trend. Every time Skaed saw the trade lists for Japanese copper, he felt very pained.

Although the trading price of Japanese copper had declined this year—thanks to the temporary suspension of trade due to the "exterminating the barbarians" campaign the previous year—the decline was not significant. After all, copper was always a scarce mineral in China, just like silver: whatever amount there was would be absorbed.

"Looks like we can't avoid directly controlling a few large copper mines ourselves." Skaed murmured, looking down at the large sand table at his feet.

In the hall, some naturalized citizen interns were working on enlarging the sand table. The process of enlargement was to use a parallelogram enlargement drawing frame to scale each contour line from a contour map onto several large sheets of paper. Then, naturalized citizen students studying surveying and mapping would wet standardized dry clay chips produced in Lingao, lay them on the drawings, and then pile them layer by layer into the shapes of mountains, rivers, and underwater continental shelves. The seabed was painted blue; forests were made by pinning large-headed pins with green paper strips attached, representing different tree species and average diameter at breast height. Then simple models marked details such as cities, mines, and ships.

In the old time-space, such simple models were made of corrugated cardboard. Since Lingao's paper mill didn't make corrugated cardboard, the Colonial Department used clay instead. Later, following Wen Zong's suggestion, they switched to mass-produced standard clay mosaic tiles, which could significantly reduce drying time, because if the layer below wasn't dry, building more layers on top would cause deformation.

Next, Senators from the Colonial Department and related departments, holding large-headed pins, pens, and paper card models representing various equipment, facilities, and buildings, took turns climbing onto the sand table, placing and repositioning. Pinned buildings represented construction plans; removed pins represented obtainable timber resources. Military personnel indicated key defense points. The Transportation Department used black, gray, and white ropes to mark future road and railway positions... Through constant placement, the entire colony's layout plan was optimized. Clerks from the Colonial Department and other departments held stacks of materials to promptly answer Senators' questions, while other clerks took records.

In the small meeting rooms nearby, Kvass and food were set out. Senators coming down from the sand table would sit and discuss while drinking. In these small meeting rooms that used to be Senator dormitories, arguments over every detail often went on all night. The success or failure of the entire operation depended on the coordination of countless details. There were clerks in all these meeting rooms to record the discussion details.

All these records would ultimately be compiled after the model project was completed to form the colonial development plan. The Colonial Department would circulate copies to relevant departments for co-signature, and each department would also provide their own document attachments to support their co-signature opinions. Then the plan would be submitted to the Executive Committee through the General Affairs Office. If the Executive Committee was prepared to use military force or a large amount of human and material resources to complete these plans, they would need to prepare a relatively concise proposal to be passed by the Senate, or at least held for a hearing.

The military was also making a larger and more accurate Hongji sand table. The General Staff had a larger sand table room specifically for war-gaming. However, Skaed knew that the military had extremely mixed feelings about the Hongji development plan.

On the one hand, they hoped that the ultimate solution to the coal problem would take the military's equipment upgrades and scale expansion to the next level. The Navy needn't even be mentioned; coal reserves directly affected the fleet that was about to be steam-powered. On the other hand, the military feared that armed conflicts arising from the Hongji development would burden the military heavily. This hesitant attitude made Skaed very dissatisfied. In his view, the military was a typical case of wanting to eat meat yet afraid of getting their hands greasy.

Skaed knew that a few days ago, Xi Yazhou had been recalled to Lingao by the Military Affairs Directorate. He Ming, newly elected as Chief of Military Affairs at the third plenary session of Senators, wanted him to preside over a war-game in the General Staff's sand table room, roughly simulating the strategic situation around Hongji. The formal report on this exercise had not yet come out. Skaed strongly suspected they were "polishing" it.

At this moment, the telephone on his desk rang. Skaed returned to his office and picked up the phone:

"Yes, it's me. What? Henan—no, the Dutch are here? All right, yes, let's keep them on their ship to cool off for a bit first."

He put down the phone. The caller was Meng De. The sudden arrival of the Dutch in Lingao greatly exceeded his expectations. The Executive Committee and the Senate had always regarded the Dutch as a major threat—somewhat out of nationalist sentiment. However, the Dutch ambition did indeed make them the most threatening opponent on the East Asian seas. Moreover, they still occupied Tayouan Port in Taiwan—which was territory the Transmigrator Group would control in the future. There was a fundamental conflict of interest.

But until now, no one had expected that the Dutch would come on their own initiative to request trade, rather than arriving murderously with a fleet to challenge Lingao. Before this, the military had conducted countless simulations on whether Old Liu Xiang would join with the Dutch to attack Lingao, Sanya, or even Hongji, but they had never imagined the opponent's purpose was to come for peaceful trade.

Among the various memoranda and plans piled in Skaed's filing cabinets and safes, the Dutch were almost ignored. Because the Department of Colonization and Trade hadn't planned to do much business with the Dutch. Most of what the Dutch could provide was not irreplaceable. What the Dutch could provide, the English could too. The Portuguese could also ship Lingao's goods. Most of the silver the Dutch could provide came from Japan and Persia.

Of course, if the trade conditions were favorable enough, doing business with the Dutch was not out of the question. After all, Lingao was currently an entity dominated by an export-oriented economy. Raw materials were imported in large quantities, products were exported in large quantities. When their own transport capacity was insufficient, having a few more middlemen who could deliver goods to the door was not bad.

However, relations with the Dutch were a matter of "diplomacy" and, as usual, had to be decided by the Senate, or rather, by the Standing Committee of the Senate.

During the Dutch merchant group's quarantine period on the ship, the Standing Committee of the Senate in Lingao had a heated debate on how to handle the Dutch. The newly elected Senate Chairman was Qian Shuiting—after the Feiyun Club turned the Cape Lingao Park into a club, it had been empty for a while. Later, the main members held a meeting and deeply reflected on the shortcomings of running the "Overseas Club." Through tireless newspaper advertising and a wide range of popular activities such as clay pigeon shooting, bonfire parties, and pistol shooting training, they gradually built up popularity. Qian Shuiting also became a "person everyone knew." So in this by-election, he was elected by virtue of good "mass relations." This surprised him, as he hadn't planned to take on the role of Senate Chairman so soon—he had originally nominated Hai Lin from the Timber Industry Department.

At the Standing Committee, most Senators believed that two tigers cannot share one mountain, and sooner or later they would have to fight the Dutch. The line of thinking that "the Dutch are the main opponent among the Europeans in East Asia" had not changed. However, the Dutch had suddenly sailed across the ocean to express their willingness to trade, sign a trade agreement, and even establish a certain degree of alliance. Given Lingao's current situation, there was no need to refuse a potential adversary expressing friendship—not to mention that the Dutch currently had no conflict of interest with Lingao.

Even if the Dutch wanted to fight, they probably had no troops to send. Lingao also temporarily had no ability to organize an expeditionary force to attack Batavia or Taiwan. However, Lingao would probably launch an operation against Taiwan within two years, so the Senate also didn't want any pacts or treaties to bind themselves. Therefore, the Senate's final resolution was to agree to sign a trade agreement with the Dutch.

Skaed received the trade license. He studied the Dutch cargo list—these goods were still piled up in the warehouse on the dock. Except for spices, everything the Dutch brought was useful. And the linen made his eyes light up; linen clothes were much more breathable and comfortable than cotton. The Agricultural Department had not promoted large-scale planting of flax and hemp in Lingao, so they only had a small amount of linen fabric, most of which was obtained through trade exchanges with the Li people.

He suddenly thought of it: currently, the Dutch were the main country trading with Japan. Dutch trade with Japan was not interrupted until Zheng Zhilong completely monopolized China's coastal trade. Right now was the time when the Dutch were making handsome profits on the Japan route. If they could purchase Japanese copper bars through the Dutch, it would be much cheaper than buying through two or three middlemen in Guangzhou.

As long as they could expand copper imports by three to four times, installing geothermal air conditioning in offices and apartments wouldn't be such an extravagance. Compared to the consumption of industrial departments, this could only be considered a drop in the bucket.

As for the goods to export to the Dutch, Skaed considered it carefully—among Lingao's bulk industrial products, glass products had dropped to a price where even reselling to Europe was profitable, so export volumes were constantly increasing. Besides that, there were the sugar products; paper was something the Dutch didn't need—they were purely middlemen, and there was no great demand for paper whether in Southeast Asia, Japan, or Persia.
