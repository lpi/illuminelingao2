# Chapter 1021 The Master of Anping

**Fujian, Quanzhou Prefecture**

Quanzhou was a prefecture. Quanzhou Prefecture administered seven counties: Jinjiang, Nan'an, Tong'an, Hui'an, Anxi, Yongchun, and Dehua. The prefectural seat was in Jinjiang County. The Senate's greatest potential enemy, Zheng Zhilong—a thorn in their throat—had his hometown of Nan'an just northwest of Jinjiang County.

Since Zheng Zhilong accepted the amnesty and became a mobile corps commander, returning home in glory, the Zheng family had become Quanzhou's wealthiest local family.

The Zheng family bought up large amounts of land in Nan'an, planting various export cash crops. Beyond maritime trade, they were also major landlords. The Zheng clan members in Nan'an naturally prospered, building magnificent mansions.

However, Zheng Zhilong wasn't satisfied with Nan'an's geographical location—as a maritime warlord, he valued a good harbor more. So he chose to build a fortified settlement in Anping Town, Jinjiang, as his main base.

Anping Town belonged to Quanzhou Prefecture. Its location wasn't on Quanzhou Bay where the Jinjiang River flowed, but rather faced Weizhou Bay with Kinmen Island visible. In ancient times it was called Wan Sea; in the Song dynasty it was renamed "Anhai"; in the Ming dynasty it was changed to "Anping." Having just one "An" (peace) character wasn't enough, so a "Ping" (tranquil) character was added—probably because this place was frequently harassed by pirates.

In the 37th year of Jiajing, this place was attacked by Japanese pirates and suffered greatly. Only then were city walls built. The lingering impact of the pirate raids was so profound that although it was already eighty years past, the place still talked about it with great fear.

Before receiving amnesty, Zheng Zhilong continuously attacked the traditional foreign trade port of Yuegang in Fujian, completely destroying Yuegang's foreign trade. He thereby achieved his goal of transferring the foreign trade port to Anping and Zhongyousuo under his control.

His choice of Anping as his base was carefully considered. Anping Town, together with Xiamen Island (Zhongyousuo) and Greater and Lesser Kinmen under his control, formed a Weizhou Bay under tight control. Any enemy attacking here would take enormous risks.

Zheng Zhilong had the Anping city walls extensively repaired, almost rebuilding a new city. Anping became Zheng Zhilong's military stronghold for self-defense and maritime trade base. Ships trading with Japan and Taiwan all entered and exited from here. The Dutch called these merchant ships "Anhai ships."

Besides repairing city walls and dredging wharves, his own enjoyment wasn't neglected either. Starting in spring of the third year of Chongzhen, Zheng Zhilong undertook large-scale construction of his own mansion in Anping. This luxurious mansion took 3 years and 2 months to complete.

According to the *Jiaqing Chidian Township Records*: The Zheng Mansion was located north of Anping Bridge, west from Xidai to Xigang, north to Xi'antou, south fronting Anping Bridge head, directly connecting to Wugang Port, covering 138 *mu*. The main structure was hipped-roof style, five bays wide with thirteen frames, three through-gates, double fire alleys, five-courtyard depth. On both sides, wing halls, pavilions, and kiosks faced each other, encircling as screens. To the east was "Dunren Pavilion," to the west "Taiyun Tower," the front hall was "Catholic Church," the middle hall "Xiaosi Hall"—all grand in scale. Behind the main building was "Zhiyuan Garden," walled for protection, with hills and valleys, pavilions, studios, ponds, small bridges, winding paths, fine trees, and exotic flowers.

At this moment, this luxurious mansion was still under intensive construction. Zheng Zhilong and his family temporarily resided in a smaller mansion in Anping Town.

Zheng Zhilong was currently in his inner study. Although the Senate thought of this person constantly, few noticed that Zheng Zhilong wasn't very old: born in 1604, in 1631 he was only 28 years old. When he took over Yan Siqi's former subordinates after Yan's death, he was only 21. In the old dimension, he would be a genuine "young talent" or "Outstanding Young Person."

The 1631 Zheng Zhilong had already eliminated most of his maritime rivals, including Li Kuiqi who had once nearly driven him to desperation. He completely controlled trade with Japan and forced his former employers, the "sea coachmen" Dutch, to trade on his terms. At this time, he commanded a massive fleet that dominated the China Sea and monopolized trade with Japan and Taiwan. Phrases like "earning a bushel of gold daily" and "wealth rivaling nations" weren't exaggerations for him—a genuine Great Ming "tall, rich, and handsome." Zheng Zhilong was also a handsome man with refined features.

He held a document in his hand.

The document was brought a few days ago by a Zheng family merchant ship returning from Taiwan. The letter writer was Zheng Zhilong's agent in Taiwan: Guo Huaiyi.

Guo Huaiyi's identity was leader of the Han immigrants in southern Taiwan. On the surface, he was merely the village head of Youchexing Village, a local immigrant settlement. Actually, Guo Huaiyi had been one of Zheng Zhilong's subordinates—a chess piece left in southern Taiwan.

Zheng Zhilong's rise was closely related to inheriting Yan Siqi's legacy. And the Taiwan influence was one of the legacies Yan Siqi left behind.

Yan Siqi was a great sea lord who dominated Chinese and Japanese waters at the time, engaging in trade and maritime plunder. At that time, he had ten main captains under him, including Yang Tiansheng, Zhang Hong, Lin Fu, Lin Yi, Li Junchen, Chen Zhongji, and Zheng Zhilong.

Like many famous sea lords of the time, Yan Siqi used Japan as his main base. As the shogunate's authority increased, Captain Yan Siqi planned ahead, considering establishing a base outside Japan.

There were many possible island locations along the Chinese coast, but the Ming dynasty still had residual prestige, and military strength hadn't declined to the later utterly vulnerable state. Coastal islands in Fujian and Zhejiang couldn't be touched—Shuangyu was a cautionary example. Even at Penghu, the Dutch built fortifications several times but were driven out by Ming forces each time. So they could only choose overseas isolated islands—the "land beyond civilization," Taiwan, thus entered their sights.

In 1624, Yan Siqi led his subordinates and immigrants to Beigang, establishing camps there and recruiting immigrants from Zhangzhou and Quanzhou from the mainland to pioneer and cultivate. The following September, while hunting at Zhuluo Mountain, Yan Siqi reportedly died there from a cold.

Yan Siqi's sudden death was somewhat suspicious, but regardless, the 21-year-old Zheng Zhilong inherited Yan Siqi's leadership position and most of his legacy.

After inheriting Yan Siqi's leadership, Zheng Zhilong didn't put much effort into Taiwan's pioneer cultivation. The Dutch expanded rapidly in Taiwan, plus the Spanish also intervened: in 1626, the Spanish built Fort San Salvador near Keelung. Two years later, Spain built Fort Santo Domingo at present-day Tamsui. Zheng Zhilong at the time was constantly warring with various major maritime powers, fighting for maritime hegemony. Not wanting to get involved in muddy waters, he once decided to abandon the immigrant settlements in Taiwan and withdraw to Fujian. He later abandoned this idea and continued operating in Taiwan. In 1628, southern Fujian suffered a great drought with many starving people. With Xiong Wencan's support, Zheng Zhilong recruited tens of thousands of refugees from Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, and other places, "giving each person three taels of silver, and one ox for every three people," transporting them by sea to Beigang to cultivate and settle. This greatly expanded the number and influence of Fujian immigrants in Taiwan.

However, from beginning to end, Zheng Zhilong never dispatched armed forces to Taiwan, nor clearly declared sovereignty over Taiwan. He only supported leaders among the Fujian immigrants in Taiwan, using them to remotely control local immigrant villages—though over the years he hadn't interfered much in local affairs. When the Dutch collected head taxes from the Chinese, he didn't intervene either.

Through local plantation owners, Zheng Zhilong continued controlling Beigang—the earliest landing and development area for mainland immigrants. Guo Huaiyi, within Dutch-controlled territory, wrote to him almost monthly, reporting local conditions. As the local Chinese leader, the Dutch depended on him for many local administrative matters. Thus Zheng Zhilong knew the Dutch's every move and trade situation like the back of his hand.

He had long known about the Dutch secretly colluding with Liu Xiang and providing support, but now he wasn't ready to turn against the Dutch.

The Dutch were fence-sitters, equally half-hearted toward Liu Xiang—they would never truly exert effort. Their only goal was to play both sides and maintain maritime balance. If he immediately turned hostile, it would only force the Dutch to openly side with his opponents.

Although Zheng Zhilong didn't fear Dutch strength—he had taught the Dutch a lesson years ago—he wasn't someone who enjoyed war either. He was first and foremost a merchant. If the Dutch truly opposed him and strenuously supported Liu Xiang with ships and cannons, it would cause him great trouble.

But Guo Huaiyi's letter didn't concern the Dutch. His report was about the Australians.

The letter mentioned that he learned from the Dutch and local natives: Last month, on the third day of September, an Australian fleet suddenly arrived at Dagou Harbor and immediately landed. They transported large numbers of personnel and materials ashore and had already built fortresses and settlements there. They apparently intended to pioneer there.

Zheng Zhilong wasn't unfamiliar with the Australians or "Shorn-Haired Criminals." Years ago, he knew about Australian goods and Australians—Li Siya had reported about them to him and presented several rare "Australian goods." Despite their mysterious origins and many strange gadgets—like that enormous iron ship.

However, contrary to the Senate's view: the Senate saw him as their greatest threat, but Zheng Zhilong didn't take them to heart. The Australians occupied Lingao—Guangdong waters weren't his sphere of influence, and he had no intention of extending his reach there. These years he was busy dealing with various rivals competing with him at sea. The Australians in a corner of western Guangdong posed no threat to him—they were more like a thorn in Zhucailao's side.

Only last year, when the Australians defeated all of Guangdong Province's expeditionary forces, then entered the Pearl River mouth and crushed government forces, advancing to Guangzhou city before withdrawing—only then did Zheng Zhilong first truly pay attention to them. At minimum, the other side was a force no less than his in both strength and will. He began focusing some attention on these overseas visitors claiming to be Song dynasty descendants.

*[Author's note: Whether Guo Huaiyi was Zheng Zhilong's subordinate is disputed. There's no strong historical evidence to prove this. This is purely novelist's license.]*
