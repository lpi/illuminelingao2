# Chapter 1142 - Cultural Exchange

"You truly are a great mathematician!" he exclaimed excitedly. "Problems Mr. Descartes couldn't figure out, you've easily provided solutions for!" His excitement made him forget the earlier interruption. "Do you have any works I could read?"

Dr. Zhong smiled. "Works..."

Suddenly Zhong Xiaoying cried out: "Duck! The ducks are smoking!"

Dr. Zhong hurriedly scrambled for a fork to turn the roast ducks. Even in this emergency, he didn't forget his "abduction" plan, quickly saying to Huygens: "I'll give you a duck... no, a pamphlet. Take it back for Mr. Descartes to see—it's my thoughts on certain mathematical and optical problems."

"That is wonderful." Huygens nodded repeatedly. "Your ducks seem about done..."

Before long, Cleadia's fish was done, and Zhong Lishi's ducks were roasted. Holding a sharp steel knife in one hand and an iron fork in the other, Zhong Lishi personally sliced the first duck into neat rows. He told Huygens: "Slicing roast duck is an art; every slice must have skin and meat... then roll the duck meat in a lotus leaf pancake, add scallion segments and sweet bean sauce... Come! Taste it..."

The flour and sweet bean sauce were brought by Dr. Zhong, while the scallions were local produce. Of course, all were top quality.

This time, not only Huygens but Cleadia and Westerly also gathered around with interest. This way of eating was quite novel to Europeans, not to mention that the Dutch of this time were famous for eating poorly.

Huygens' eyes suddenly bulged, and he was speechless for a long time.

"How does it taste?"

"It tastes good! Excellent!" Huygens praised sincerely. "Much better than roast goose! Hmm, a complex flavor."

The banquet was held in the Customs Hall. Windows on all sides were open, covered with iron mesh screens, allowing cool sea breezes in while preventing the prolific local insects from swarming the lights.

Gas lamps illuminated the entire hall brightly. Cleadia quietly walked in to look. Seeing the screens on all four sides densely covered with bugs, she felt a wave of revulsion and quickly turned her head. She curiously looked at the tableware and cutlery on the long dining table covered with a white tablecloth. Although most dishes were Chinese style, the format was a buffet. The white tablecloth was set entirely with porcelain and silver tableware—Wei Bachi valued the "Taiwan Governor's Mansion" pomp highly, wanting to display the "majesty of the Committee's highest representative" everywhere.

"So many knives, forks, and porcelain... truly grand..." Cleadia whispered to her brother.

At the time, fork usage wasn't widespread in Europe. But she didn't find chopsticks strange: she had gotten used to Chinese tableware in Batavia and was even eager to try.

Westerly also wore formal attire—he and his sister had received formal invitations. Just now he felt a bit overheated—Europeans, especially those of some status, wouldn't take off their clothes even in hot Southeast Asia. His skin, already ruddy, turned even redder, like a grilled prawn.

"I heard the Australians are indeed luxurious," Westerly said with feigned calm. "Father said the Australians have abundant produce and possess endless wealth..."

He pointed to a redwood grandfather clock at the end of the banquet hall—like the one in Purple Lightning Tower, it was a hybrid of modern mechanism and local casing.

"Look, Sister, that's an Australian clock. Very beautiful, isn't it?" Westerly said with relish. "It's very different from Dutch clocks. They say it's from Dr. Zhong's hand—I really want to learn from him."

As the two spoke in low voices, the large grandfather clock chimed loudly. After striking six times, music suddenly sounded in the empty banquet hall—it was the welcome tune ordained by the Committee: "Beautiful Australia."

Led by Wei Bachi, Committee members Zhong Lishi, Hong Laojun, Shi Dafu, and others wearing formal attire entered in sequence amidst the music. Hai Mao and Huygens gave speeches respectively, then the band played symphony music, and the banquet began.

Facing a table full of Chinese and Western delicacies, the Committee members and the Dutchmen accompanying Huygens ate ravenously, juices dripping. But Zhong Lishi and Huygens seemed somewhat restrained, burping constantly despite not eating much. Wei Bachi found it strange and asked Huygens, "Mr. Huygens, is the food not to your taste?"

"Oh, very delicious! Very delicious!"

Seeing this, Zhong Xiaoying whispered something to Cleadia, and both couldn't help giggling. Westerly hurriedly leaned over to ask, and Cleadia whispered to her brother: "Those two ate while cooking in the kitchen; each ate nearly half a duck and two fish..."

The day after the banquet, Wei Bachi had someone take the Bontekoe siblings to the Kaohsiung Health Center, where they had physical exams and received cowpox vaccinations.

The reaction to cowpox was very minor, basically requiring little care. To be safe, they rested for a few days as per doctor's orders, coming out again only after the vaccination sites had scabbed over. Zhong Lishi sent them some illustrated popular science magazines published by the Grand Library to pass the time. According to the maid responsible for caring for them: Westerly read very intently, always trying to understand the Chinese characters explaining the pictures. He even specifically asked the maid for a Dutch-Australian dictionary or similar book.

Dr. Zhong thought, *I do have a Dutch-Chinese Dictionary, but I can't give it to him.* There were surely ready-made ones in the Grand Library, but demand was too small to justify specialized printing.

"Knowledge is power," he thought secretly. *As long as you have power, people naturally hope to understand you, learn from you. Learn your language.* Teaching language was actually an effective means of cultural dissemination—he should suggest the Grand Library publish some dictionaries and linguistics textbooks.

He thought for a moment and called Zhong Xiaoying—he noticed his adopted daughter seemed to get along well with these two children, gesturing and laughing throughout the banquet.

"Is Honorable Father asking how Cleadia's Cantonese is?" Zhong Xiaoying made a face. "Her Cantonese is as good as Honorable Father's..."

"Ahem," Dr. Zhong coughed a few times before Zhong Xiaoying answered honestly: "She can speak simple conversion; for complex things she has to gesture—but Miss Cleadia has strong language learning ability. She says she can speak several languages..."

"Since that's the case, teach her Mandarin properly," Zhong Lishi said. "This is a task I give you. And her brother too."

"Yes, Honorable Father," Zhong Xiaoying said. "But they probably won't stay here long?"

"They'll stay here for at least half a month or more." Zhong Lishi had already asked Huygens: they planned to stay in Taiwan for a month. Originally they planned to stay in Fort Zeelandia. But yesterday Huygens had notified him: they hoped to stay in the more comfortable and hygienic Kaohsiung Trading House—of course, they would pay for room and board.

"I also want to discuss mathematics, astronomy, and physics problems with you day and night." Huygens showed great enthusiasm.

A few days later, the siblings' scars had healed. Bontekoe had company business in Tayouan, so he returned there first, leaving the siblings in Kaohsiung under Huygens' guardianship.

"Excuse me, where is St. Anthony's Church?" Westerly and Cleadia came out the gate—this was their first time out in days, and they weren't used to the sunlight.

"Just on the hillside over there..." A trading house servant pointed. On a small hill beside the street stood a wooden Jesuit church.

This was Westerly and Cleadia's first time out freely without escort—being a completely strange area, they were somewhat timid. They heard there was a Catholic church here with missionaries from Europe, so they decided to visit—Cleadia could verify speak a little Italian.

The Franz von Bontekoe family weren't citizens of the Seven Provinces Republic; they were Germans serving the Dutch East India Company, from an old Hanseatic League city in northwest Germany. Many Germans from this region worked as merchants and sailors. The Bontekoe family were actually Catholics.
