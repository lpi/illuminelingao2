# Chapter 743 - Shipbuilding Plan

Xiao Zishan and Fang Fei discussed and concluded that since it was already late November, there were still many things to do after the fleet returned, including the "Plan-Do-Check-Act" complete process repeatedly advocated by Wen Desi, which would take at least half a month. They also had to transport infrastructure materials and necessary munitions to Base 852 in Hong Kong to ensure the Hong Kong Detachment could withstand any enemy counterattacks locally.

Calculating this way, Xiao Zishan thought it better to postpone the Annual Meeting until late December—to celebrate together with the Gregorian New Year of 1631.

"You know, enduring a trade blockade for more than half a year, many supplies are out of stock. This one month is just right to catch a breath; handling the Annual Meeting will be convenient once supplies are abundant."

Thus, the Annual Meeting was finally decided to be held around December 26th—according to nearly three years of observation by the Gaoshanling Meteorological Observatory, the minimum temperature in Lingao during the winter of this spacetime was around 9-10 degrees Celsius, usually appearing in mid-January. The average temperature in late December was still 17 or 18 degrees, sometimes even reaching around 21 degrees; an open-air gathering by the sea would be suitably warm.

Inside the Executive Committee, intense consultations were currently underway regarding the results of the Pearl River Action, follow-up issues, and next year's strategic planning. Liu Xiang's disappearance from the Pearl River Estuary surprised the Executive Committee greatly—they hadn't expected this Chief Pirate, who fought Zheng Zhilong to the bitter end, to so decisively abandon his traditional territory to avoid battle. The Executive Committee was very worried about this, deeply fearing Liu Xiang would choose a time to launch a large-scale counterattack on the Hong Kong base. The Hong Kong base was still in a rudimentary stage; whether the sub-fleet or the garrison, the forces were very weak. It urgently needed large-scale reinforcement.

Reinforcement supplies shipped from Lingao included not only cannons, soldiers, and building materials but also a large number of skilled construction workers for the infrastructure construction of Hong Kong's port opening next year. Wharves, trestle bridges, warehouses, shops. Si Kaide strove every day at the Executive Committee working meetings for supplies and shipping tonnage to Hong Kong—aside from some supplies that could be purchased nearby from Guangdong, most supplies needed by Hong Kong still needed to be shipped from Lingao.

The sea route of over 700 kilometers from Lingao to Hong Kong placed the construction of a large-scale convoy and escort system on the agenda. The purely civilian shipping enterprises like Gaoguang Shipping used in the past could no longer provide cover—Liu Xiang and Zheng Zhilong could launch indiscriminate attacks on all ships on this route at any time.

On Hainan Island, apart from Qiongshan, the northern counties had fallen into the hands of the Australian Song one after another, but the subsequent regime construction in each county required the circulation of large amounts of personnel and supplies, all needing massive sea transport capacity. Meanwhile, the demand for supplies and manpower for Sanya's development remained endless, making ship transport capacity tight. Except for the few months during the counter-encirclement campaign when foreign trade was interrupted and shipping capacity was loose, since the Chengmai Grand Victory, the entire sea transport capacity presented a situation of strong demand, so much so that by October, the allocation of coastal transport tonnage, previously unrestricted, was also brought under the comprehensive management of the Planning Agency.

The tension in transport capacity made relying on original small and medium naval vessels for freight increasingly difficult. Excessively frequent sea voyages deteriorated the working conditions of ships and sailors, and maritime loss situations began to rise.

Expanding the fleet became a consensus of the Executive Committee, but throughout 1630, due to the war and the development of Sanya, the Finance Directorate's investment in infrastructure, army and navy, and military facilities took up more than half of the annual budget. The expense directly used for shipbuilding was almost zero. Lingao's shipping industry relied almost entirely on the maintenance and conversion of old ships for support. Although in terms of scale, Lingao's fleet was quite considerable, with a holding of 126 old-style sailing ships of the double-mast/100-ton-plus class, plus another 92 single-mast ships of 30-70 tons.

These ships were all managed and controlled by the Navy. Some were converted to use as fishing boats, some installed varying amounts of cannons and typewriters (machine guns) to become professional Special Service Boats for combat, and another part installed a small number of cannons, specifically used for various maritime chores, including transport, patrol, and fishing. Naming was also simple, just simply using Registered Port + Usage + Number. Such as names like: "Lin-Te" (Lingao Special), "Lin-Yu" (Lingao Fish), "Lin-Yun" (Lingao Transport).

21 ships with a deadweight tonnage of 200-500 tons—large sailing ships like the "Qionghai Coal"—were granted independent ship names and used centrally as dedicated transport ships, especially the grain transport ships going to Vietnam and the supply transport ships going to Sanya and Hong Kong, all borne by these "Large Ships." These ships also had a small amount of armament and left room for expanding armament; they could be committed to battle when necessary.

Apart from these Navy-controlled ships, on the Guangzhou-Leizhou-Lingao route, there used to be ships from Gaoguang Shipping and Haian Shipping operating. These ships were controlled by the Ministry of Colonization and Trade, managed by Guangzhou Station and Leizhou Station respectively. Gaoguang Shipping had 12 three-masted large Fu ships, named in the "Guang + Heavenly Stem" and "Gao + Earthly Branch" manner respectively. These ships operated regular passenger-cargo mixed routes between Guangzhou and Lingao. Business was booming before the second counter-encirclement campaign; before the start of the second counter-encirclement operation, some ships fled to Lingao, and some were detained and confiscated by the government. Business had not yet recovered temporarily.

As for the ships of Haian Shipping, all were smaller tonnage salt ships used along the coast, originally mainly used to transport Leizhou sugar to Guangzhou and other places for sale. Besides transporting sugar, they usually transported Leizhou coal, timber, and agricultural products to Lingao and other short-distance sea transport.

Although most ships were managed and used by the Navy, the allocation of transport tonnage was actually controlled specifically by the Planning Agency. The Transport Office of the Planning Agency had specialized stowage diagrams and tables, recording various cargo logistics situations accurate to the hour.

After the Navy executed the Pearl River Estuary Campaign, a large number of ships were transferred to serve as warships and transport ships, making the entire Lingao shipping capacity even more scarce. Furthermore, the permanent stationing of two squadrons of Special Service Boats in Hong Kong further shrank the already overwhelmed Navy fleet capacity.

Their *Swift Whale* self-propelled deck barge was amazing in transport volume, but this ship could only operate in coastal areas with better sea conditions, and its power system was a diesel engine, which had already consumed a large amount of diesel after executing several Sanya transport missions. As the only modern ship capable of transporting super-large, super-heavy, or super-long cargoes, the Planning Agency really couldn't make up its mind to continue letting it perform routine freight tasks.

This severe situation caused the motion for emergency shipbuilding to be raised once again at the Executive Committee's working meeting. Shipbuilding not only had to meet transport needs but also expand naval combat vessels. Chen Haiyang explicitly pointed out at the meeting that the existing armed Special Service ships were too small in tonnage, limiting the number and caliber of cannons installed. Especially regarding the 24-pounder Carronades installed on some Special Service Boats, Chen Haiyang believed this small, short-range cannon had little significance.

"The effective range of a 24-pounder Carronade is only 100-200 meters. If encountering Western warships, we lose in range; if encountering pirate fleets like Liu Xiang's, if a single artillery volley cannot destroy the enemy ship and reload immediately, we will be swamped in boarding battles." Chen Haiyang mentioned that in the Humen and Guangdong inland river battles, the Special Service Boat Squadrons equipped with Carronades had to wait multiple times for the Cannon Squadrons to inflict damage from long range first before joining the battle to avoid being damaged by Ming Army Hongyipao (Red Barbarian Cannons) at close range.

"The Carronade Squadron only showed its advantage of relatively strong destructiveness in the Battle of Lantau when dealing with small groups of pirates with very poor firepower and no numerical advantage. In the long run, Carronade Squadrons can only serve for patrol or escort."

Additionally, the Special Service Boats of the Special Service Squadrons were mostly small in tonnage, difficult to conduct sustained operations—some ships were of poor build quality, and none of these ships had copper sheathing on their bottoms; shipworm and marine organism fouling had become extremely serious. Chen Haiyang estimated that about one-third of the ships needed immediate maintenance.

"If we continue to use Special Service ships for heavy transport and escort missions, we will soon face an awkward situation where more than half of the ships will be under maintenance by the first half of 1631." Chen Haiyang warned, "Shipbuilding, especially building large tonnage ships capable of long-term use, is imminent!"

"Our current situation where transport ships and warships are not separated is inappropriate. Superficially it looks like comprehensive utilization, but in reality, whether ship modification or allocation, it makes everything neither fish nor fowl." Navy Chief of Naval Operations Ming Qiu spoke.

The only ships the Australian Song Navy truly modified or built as warships were the *Zhenhai* and *Fubo* double-masted gunboats and iron-ribbed wood-hulled triangular sail patrol boats, but their tonnage did not exceed 200 tons. They were ships as small as could be. The Navy Chief of Naval Operations Department concluded from map wargames that if the four Type 8154 Cruisers didn't sortie, the Australian Song Navy could only maintain absolute superiority in small-scale battles. Once encountering large maritime forces like Liu Xiang or Zheng Zhilong who could mobilize hundreds of large ships at any time, it would be difficult for the Navy to ensure victory.

The Navy hoped to obtain several large-tonnage, sail or steam-powered large warships. In armament, speed, and endurance, they should at least be at the level of early 19th-century cruisers.

Finally, the Navy put forward a request: Start construction of 2 thousand-ton class three-masted sailing cruisers within the 1630 fiscal year via supplementary appropriation, and start construction of another 6-10 500-ton class armed auxiliary vessels in the 1631 fiscal year.

"Obviously, this is a bit rushed." Ma Qianzhu spoke slowly only after Chen Haiyang finished speaking. "Large warships are certainly very useful. However, even without discussing whether our technical capabilities and material reserves are enough to build this 19th-century level cruiser, the construction cycle for this thousand-ton ship would be at least one year, right?" As he spoke, he looked back at Zhan Wuya.

"A three-hundred-ton wooden ship, if materials are sufficient and manpower is sufficient, takes about six months to build by storming the job." Zhan Wuya said, "But now that we can build iron-ribbed ships, the construction cycle can be further shortened. Three to four months."

"Obviously, what we need to build now is not such big ships—because we need ships that can be put into use in a short time, like within two or three months." Ma Qianzhu said, "Because existing naval ships will face overhaul and maintenance problems within half a year. Starting construction on ships that can only be put into use a year later will only create a gap in naval power."

This was flagrant opposition to the Navy's proposed shipbuilding plan. For a moment, the Executive Committee conference room was somewhat cold. Chen Haiyang wanted to rebut, but Ma Qianzhu's words were well-founded and confirmed by the industrial department.

Wu De said: "It's too late to build large warships. I think we should solve the transport capacity problem essentially first."

At the root, the Navy had too many tasks and bore too heavy a transport burden, leaving ships insufficient time for maintenance. Wu De suggested storming the construction of a batch of dedicated transport ships to replace the Special Service Boats currently in use, liberating them from heavy transport tasks.

"I don't understand shipbuilding, but we can reference the American concept of building Liberty Ships, standardizing the design and construction of a batch of armed transport ships. At this stage, for rapid construction, limit ship tonnage to 300-500 tons, using wind sail power." Wu De elaborated his thoughts, "Of course, space can be left for installing steam engines in the future."

"If steam engines are to be installed, a smaller one can be installed first; 50 horsepower is enough." Wen Desi interjected, "As auxiliary power for sail manipulation. Having steam engine power to assist sail manipulation will greatly reduce requirements for sailors' sail handling ability and can also save a lot of manpower."

Zhan Wuya said: "Using iron-ribbed wood-hulled structure, it can be completed in about four months."

Ma Qianzhu said: "Still a bit slow. Best if they can be put into use within two or three months."

Wu De said: "My other proposal is to build barges."

Wu De stated he conducted a survey of transport conditions and found that a large part of transport capacity was occupied by coastal transport, including short-distance bulk transport like salt from Maniao to Bopu. Although a convoy system was adopted, in reality, every ship navigated independently using sails.

Wu De proposed using the technogically mature steam *Daihatsu* boats as tugboats and rapidly building a batch of unpowered barges to undertake coastal transport tasks.

"All-steel barges can carry over a thousand tons." Wu De said, "We don't have that much steel, so build iron-framed wood-hulled barges; even decks aren't needed. Transport capacity around 200 tons per ship, a convoy of 10 barges."

"In that case, steam *Daihatsu* boats can't tow them." Wen Desi said.

"Then build steam tugboats!" Wu De said, "We can manufacture 500 horsepower steam engines now. Building or modifying a few tugboats for coastal use shouldn't be a problem."

Everyone thought this plan feasible. Building 500 horsepower steam engines was already relatively skilled work for the machinery department. As for the tugboat itself, if sea condition requirements weren't high, the construction difficulty of small tugboats wasn't great either; the construction period would be about a month.

As for the issue of expanding combat power raised by the Navy, Wen Desi proposed: The shelved Project 854 could be restarted. This large ship, originally intended as the Empire's first ironclad, had completed keel laying and rib installation before being forced to shut down due to squeezing too much steel. Since then, Project 854 had been like the skeleton of a prehistoric dinosaur, displayed on the slipway of the shipyard for people to admire.

Truth be told, even just the keel and ribs, the momentum of this ship had already shocked countless indigenous people. They couldn't figure out how these giant iron bones were manufactured, nor could they imagine the manpower to assemble and combine them.

The discontinuation of 854 had a lot to do with the insufficient supply of steel materials. More importantly, qualified riveters were pitifully few at the time. The few apprentices Zhou Bili led barely managed to manufacture boilers; large-scale riveting of ship hulls was almost impossible in terms of both process difficulty and manpower quantity.

Although Wen Desi held a grudge about the discontinuation of Project 854, shipbuilding didn't rely solely on blueprints; workers' technical level and processing capability were also important parts, so he had to acquiesce to this reality.

Now, after mass-manufacturing the Mohist series boilers known as "Bomb Boilers," Zhou Bili's disciples and grand-disciples had accumulated considerable experience—although they didn't dare to use it for riveting such a huge ship hull, they had considerable certainty regarding some hull components and marine boilers.

Wen Desi proposed a brand new "854 Modified" plan based on the workers' technical level.

The so-called 854 Modified plan was based on utilizing the completed parts of Project 854. The ship form and structure didn't change, only the construction process was simplified technically, changing the original all-iron hull to an iron-ribbed wood-hulled ship. Wood-hulled ships were easier to maintain than iron-hulled ships. In construction, there was no need to rely on the somewhat unreliable riveting craft of indigenous workers. The demand for steel also dropped significantly.

The formal model name for 854 Modified was the "1630 Class Iron-Ribbed Wood-Hulled Clipper-Bow Steam-Auxiliary Sail Cruiser." Design specifications: Displacement 1160 tons, Length 70 meters, Beam 9.9 meters, Draft 6.25 meters. Installed with one 200 horsepower steam engine. Speed 8 knots (steam power), 16 knots (sail power). Crew 109. Full-Rigged layout. The steam engine not only provided navigation power but could also provide power for operating sails, greatly saving the number of sailors.

This type of ship was modeled on the steam-sail hybrid cruisers of the 1860s. Warships of this tonnage were classified as 3rd Class Cruisers in the US Navy at the time. As commerce raiders, they were used very extensively during the American Civil War, their footprints covering the world's major oceans.
