# Chapter 266 Yulin Fort

It wasn't vegetable oil, nor peanut oil, and certainly not the butter used by Europeans. Li Huamei carefully stored the paper wick away and screwed the lid back on. It seemed the key to making this mechanism move was this oil.

Looking around, two sets of windmill-like blades were fixed on racks, also covered with quite a bit of dark, greasy residue. On closer inspection, whether it was these large black components or the windmill blades, all were made of refined iron. The Australians' love for and skill with iron was well-deserved. The cabin also had many cabinets and shelves. She opened them one by one to explore. They were all strange iron implements, each stored in its own small box, neatly organized. Some she recognized; European master carpenters also used similar-looking things. But for most of them, she couldn't tell what purpose they served.

More than ten minutes later, footsteps and watch-changing orders began to sound outside the door. She quickly stopped, held her breath, and remained still for a few seconds. Only after the sounds completely died down did she hurriedly put things back and slip out through a porthole.

The next day, the fleet continued its voyage after completing the base construction. The lower decks were piled everywhere with baskets of coconuts, totaling over five thousand. Jiang Qiuyan had to prohibit everyone from drinking coconut water as a thirst quencher, lest someone develop an electrolyte imbalance.

The exploration team's next target was Wanning—specifically, Shangen Town in Wanning. Shangen Town had a small pyrite mine. In terms of scale, it was very small. Its unique feature was that it was right by the sea. If they could ascertain the specific location and reserves, the transmigrators could stage an expedition-style, large-scale blitz mining operation, extracting a hundred tons or so in one go.

"This stuff can be used to make sulfuric acid and also as fertilizer; it's quite useful for us, especially the sulfuric acid," Wang Luobin said. "The coal-chemical complex can produce sulfuric acid easily, but coal will have to rely on imports for a long time. Mining pyrite can at least solve part of the problem."

"We don't need to build another Wanning Fort, do we?" Chen Haiyang thought about how his fleet's personnel had already been reduced by nearly a third. If they had to leave more garrison troops, he really couldn't sustain it.

Wang Luobin said, "No, no, Shangen is barren, and Wanning is not a development priority for now. This place was still sparsely populated into the 20th century; in this spacetime, there probably won't be anyone here at all."

While they were talking, Ruan Xiaowu came running up, snapped to attention, and saluted: "Report! Commander Chen, it's time for the scheduled transmission. The radio room requests your signature on the telegrams!"

"Bring them here." Chen Haiyang took the telegram folder. Inside were the routine messages for the day, reporting the fleet's current position, its status, and the next destination. Although routine, this was their most effective safety guarantee while sailing at sea. According to the encryption regulations jointly formulated by the Executive Committee and Lingao Telecom, starting from March 1629, each major committee and department began using independent codebooks. After encryption, messages were handed to Lingao Telecom for transmission and reception, with decoding work handled by each department independently. This prevented telegrams from becoming open broadcasts: once a telegram was sent out, within a dozen minutes, every location equipped with a 15W or 5W radio set would know about it. As for which types of messages were encrypted and which were not, each department established its own regulations.

Today's messages bore the "Navy Secret" stamp as usual. Chen Haiyang flipped through. There were also a few received messages: one was a plaintext message from the Guangzhou Station, filled with all sorts of idle chatter—probably the Guangzhou Station's radio operator chatting with a female operator at Lingao Telecom. Another was a "Navy Secret" message from Changhua Fort, briefly reporting on their recent expedition into the Li district.

"Quite impressive—they swindled ten cows and a girl back." Chen Haiyang signed off on the outgoing message and, laughing, showed the telegram folder to Wang Luobin, who also needed to sign.

"It shows everyone is good at mobilizing the masses. Mass work is expanding well." Wang Luobin signed. "Establishing a foothold in Changhua and building a long-term friendly relationship with the Li stockade will benefit the future development of Shilu. I think we should cable the Executive Committee and give them a collective first-class merit award or something."

"Haha, Engineer Wang, Xiao Zishan won't forget about this. He loves doing this kind of thing." Chen Haiyang sighed. "When we get back to Lingao, a collective second-class merit is guaranteed. Maybe there'll even be another sleeve emblem to sew on."

"Actually, rewarding them with a few personal secretaries would be more practical—" Engineer Wang originally had no interest in those thin, dark local girls, but recently he'd noticed that the girls nurtured by the Lingao Liberated Area's water and soil had begun to fill out and turn fair-skinned. Inevitably, some thoughts unsuitable for educators began to stir.

"Personal secretaries?" Chen Haiyang snorted. "The Executive Committee means well, but I'm afraid in the end, good intentions might turn into bad outcomes. It could end up hurting people's feelings and affecting solidarity."

"Pool the wisdom of the masses, pool the wisdom of the masses." As they spoke, Ruan Xiaowu had already run off. Chen Haiyang watched his retreating figure and said with some emotion, "Kids like him, after training for a few months, already look presentable. They work hard and obey orders. Uneducated, but with high comprehension. In another three or four years, when they come of age, they'll be our backbone—at that time, how nice it would be to match them up with those girls."

"Haha, you've thought it through. You've already planned matchmaking for your subordinates?"

"To make soldiers willing to fight and die with you, an officer must truly be like a father and brother to them."

At the newly completed Yulin Fort base, a garrison led by Old Di and Bai Guoshi was left behind, fourteen people in total. They would live under this blue sky and white clouds for about a month. During this time, Bai Guoshi would thoroughly survey the local resources and collect social information. As for Old Di, his task was simpler: cut timber here, and under Bai Guoshi's guidance, learn to harvest coconuts—using the tree-climbing method, which, according to him, was crucial for stable and high-yield coconut production.

Old Di watched the sails grow distant with mixed emotions. Then he turned to Bai Guoshi and the other transmigrators and said, "Let's talk about how we're going to spend this month on 'vacation.'"

"The vacation agenda is pretty full." Bai Guoshi surveyed the pile of supplies and tools left behind. There were machetes, carrying poles, axes, saws, and large quantities of rope and rattan baskets. Not much ironware was left—after all, there were blacksmiths just across the bay. They'd also been left a batch of goods for trading with Anyoule Market, mainly white sugar and distilled spirits. Food reserves totaled sixty days' worth, and for emergencies, fifty taels of silver were left.

"Let's first try the radio."

Old Di directed the marines to collect things on the beach and move them one by one into Yulin Fort, while Bai Guoshi and the other transmigrators went to set up the 5W transceiver left for their communications. After calling for five minutes, Lingao Main Station already responded, and the signals were clear. Next, they called the exploration fleet and quickly received a reply. Finally, a new signal suddenly broke in on the radio: Changhua Fort had heard their calls and was responding. The exchange of radio waves lightened everyone's originally lonely and anxious hearts considerably.

Since they were here, they might as well settle in. To stay here for a month, the first order of business was to get themselves and their subordinates well situated. So they made a small division of labor. Old Di would be the commander of Yulin Fort, mainly responsible for defense and construction work; Bai Guoshi would be responsible for collecting resources—he'd received some emergency medical training, so he served as the team's medic; Wang Tao would handle dealings with Anyoule Market—all external negotiations and procurements were his responsibility. He also had a boy adopted from among the orphans shipped from Guangzhou as his apprentice. At a time when everyone was eagerly hoping to adopt little lolis, his adoption of a young boy had briefly made his... preferences a topic of discussion.

"It's nothing special," Wang Tao said calmly. "I just want him to learn storytelling from me. Otherwise, when I die, no one will know how to do it anymore. There has to be a legacy, right?"

The boy took Wang Tao's surname Wang and was named Wang Degang—the name was, of course, a joke. But it sounded impressive and respectable when called out.

Despite being only about ten years old, Wang Degang, under his master's tutelage, had learned quite a few traditional *pingshu* storytelling and *xiangsheng* comedy routines. He was an artistic backbone at the Citizens School. Wang Tao also taught him public speaking and debate every day—that was his forte as a training instructor—preparing for his little apprentice to run for student government in the first Citizens School election the following year. His next goal was to lobby the Executive Committee to establish a Youth League organization. This apprentice could then rise through the League faction route.

Finally, there was Shen Yuefeng, a "sea turtle" (overseas returnee) who had majored in history with IT as a minor. Neither was particularly useful to the transmigrators. Fortunately, he was a military enthusiast, and thanks to the decadent blessings of the US of A, he had considerable experience with target shooting and hunting. He had been drafted into the Remote Exploration Team during its expansion after receiving a few weeks of natural history education. He was left here primarily to collect local animal specimens and meat, and in case of food shortages, to provide provisions. These few people clearly didn't take the Health Department's warnings to heart. But with an ample meat supply, everyone's morale would also be higher. Whether harvesting coconuts or felling timber, it was all heavy labor. Besides, after checking Yulin Fort's water source situation, Old Di felt it wasn't quite satisfactory and wanted to improve it.

"The current water source is an irrigation channel dug from the nearby small river. Although it gives us a small moat, it would also be easy for an enemy to cut off this water supply or poison it," Old Di said.

"You want to dig a well? But we don't have the equipment."

"A well dug here would probably yield saltwater anyway. I want to build an underground channel to draw water from the river by another route. That way, an enemy won't easily discover it."
