# Chapter 1905 - Teaching Through Divine Means

New Daoism's platform was distinctive. The ritual stage was encircled by banners of various colors inscribed with "National Peace and Prosperity" and "Reverence to Heaven, Prayers for Blessings." Scripture streamers were densely arrayed around it, and at each of the four corners of the platform were placed or hung objects the audience had never seen before. A large horn-shaped speaker hung from one corner, from which emanated the *Daoqing* ballads the Daoists had been singing while parading through the streets in recent days.

Though the crowd had witnessed Daoists performing rituals before—walking on knife mountains, crossing seas of fire, ascending cloud towers, and the like—they had never seen such a theatrical ritual stage before. Finding it quite novel, they each found spots to stand or sit and wait. Meanwhile, vendors circulated through the crowd, loudly hawking snacks, seeds, and sour plum soup. For a time, the scene was extraordinarily lively.

Presently, a group of Daoists emerged from behind a curtained enclosure by the riverbank. At their head was a portly Daoist priest. He wore a ceremonial robe embroidered with gold and silver thread, and upon his head sat a Purple Gold Lotus Crown. Yet rather than the court tablet typically held by Daoists during sacrificial rites, he carried a strange black rod in his hand. Behind him followed two rows of young disciples—one row of blue-robed lads, one of green-robed girls—chanting an ancient melody as they walked slowly forward.

Though to all appearances they were not exerting themselves vocally, their lyrics resounded clearly to everyone's ears no matter where they stood in the plaza:

*I bow my head to the Void, the Unsurpassed Way,*
*Great Compassionate Deliverer from Suffering.*
*Divine light shines a hundred billion rays through dark chaos,*
*Spreading clouds of mercy, sprinkling the rain of Dharma.*

*The Gorge Stone's cold netherworld, the Prison Without Interval,*
*The Blood Lake, Blood Sea, Blood Basin Pool.*
*The Jade Register grants great amnesty to all sinful souls,*
*Release them from sinking, untold kalpas of suffering.*

...

A Daoist priest in the crowd heard this and nodded to himself, murmuring to his companion: "These Australian Daoists also follow the Great Way of the Supreme Lord. Listen—they are chanting the *Yuanshi Tianzun's True Scripture for Saving All from the Blood Lake*." His companion said nothing, merely nodded.

Then they saw the Daoists ascend the altar—but rather than performing the ritual of inviting the gods, the young disciples divided by gender into two columns flanking the altar. The portly priest proceeded to the depths of the altar and drew back the central curtain, revealing a long offering table. Strangely, the table held no three animal sacrifices, only simple offerings of fragrant flowers, fruits, and water. Behind the table hung a portrait of the Three Pure Ones.

The portly priest did not kneel before the portrait. He merely held three sticks of sandalwood incense and bowed three times to the image of the Three Pure Ones, then placed the incense sticks in the burner.

The two Daoists in the crowd stared in disbelief. The younger one tugged at the elder's sleeve and stammered: "Ma-Master, he... he didn't even kneel when he saw the Three Pure Ancestors!" The old Daoist said nothing, merely shook his head and sighed.

Then they saw Archpriest Cui, clad in his ritual robe with a wooden sword thrust through his sash at the back, take his position at center stage, his expression the very picture of righteous solemnity. He intoned a memorial oration in a voice like a great bell, so powerful it nearly drowned out the hubbub at the edges of the platform.

The memorial read:

*Alas! At this time when Guangzhou submits to our rule and the Great Song rises anew, there were yet evil ones who harvested the living and maimed, who practiced gu-witchcraft and curses to hex the Elders. Yet our Great Song holds Heaven's Mandate: the dragon energy of the Ram City is gathered once more. The Elders of the Great Song are Heaven's chosen ones, naturally blessed by passing spirits. The ghost-cavern tricks could gain no purchase with them. Enraged and humiliated, the fiends wreaked pestilence upon the common folk. Our innocents suffered this fell harm. Where shall wandering ghosts dwell? How shall roaming spirits find peace?*

*I make this vow to deliver the departed souls and roaming ghosts, composing this funeral oration for their transcendence. I ponder the sorrow of the people afflicted by gu-poisoning, the grief of subjects struck by plague, and all the netherworld's resentful spirits. May they hold penitent hearts and cherish thoughts of goodness, sincerely repent and reform, comprehend life and death, abandon rancor for virtue, and either be reborn in the Pure Land or transform into human form, escaping the bitter path, transcending ice and fire, perfecting the Great Way, returning to Nature. Only then may the work of salvation succeed in accordance with the Way of Heaven and Earth.*

*I have bathed in incense, walked barefoot with hair unbound, set the pure altar with fragrant flowers, the Lotus Waters birthing talismans of Fire Refinement, the mist of incense like the Milky Way of Heaven, the lanterns and candles arrayed in the pattern of the Dipper, the ritual platform embodying the numerology of Heaven and Earth. Radiant light illuminates all; fire responds to the morning star; brilliance rivals sun and moon, shining through the Nine Darknesses. Vestments of gold and purple, silk sashes coiled with dragons, the altar soaring high, nine upon nine forming the citadel, the memorial tablet inscribed with thunder, the commands carved with mysterious song.*

*Celestial music rises on all sides, bells and chimes play in harmony. In my left hand I hold sweet dew, the willow branch dripping sap. In my right I carry the jade talisman, its spells intricately carved. My feet tread the Eight Trigrams, stepping through the void to receive the departed. I worship the Five Elders, breaking open the prison to save the dead. Water and fire refine and save; the bright moon illuminates their souls. The pure sea washes their forms. I sprinkle sweet dew to pacify their hun-souls; I command the jade talisman to restore their po-spirits. They mount the Platform of the Seven Stars, performing the ritual protocol of Dizang. My lips chant divine incantations; my sword transforms into talismans. Celestial mist enfolds them; the Three Flowers gather at the Crown in flames of light; the Five Qi return to the Origin on a lotus throne.*

*I drink water from the Three Rivers and spray it as the mist of the Mysterious Heaven; I dance in the Primordial Garments, conjuring shadows of the Great Void. I summon Heavenly Warriors to be generals who open the prison gates; I call Celestial Youths to guide them across the Blood Lake. The Five-Colored Gold Banners summon souls and call the dead. When the souls return, may they peacefully proceed to the Human Path to be transformed into bodies. The Seven-Colored Sandalwood Incense captures souls and gathers fortune. When the souls return, may they peacefully enjoy human virtues and be reborn as the worthy.*

*With vermilion brush I inscribe the talisman; with golden ink I write the register. Fire and candle blaze bright, illuminating all directions. Transform resentment and dissolve guilt; pray for peace and safety. I make this oath to the Underworld: may the departed souls never again wander there. Cultivate virtue, practice goodness, pacify heart and establish destiny, to repay the virtue of Heaven and Earth, to inherit the transformation of Yin and Yang, to greatly save the Netherworld, to fulfill the vow of Dizang, bowing in supplication to the Azure Mystery.*

*I worship the Heavenly Worthy, I prostrate before the Bodhisattva. With humble will I deliver the departed spirits. May they be reborn soon and return to peace.*

*With this text I make offering to the departed souls. Alas, please enjoy, partake of our offering. Hear the Dharma and be delivered. Universal salvation to all departed spirits.*

Cui Hantang shook the Three Pure Ones bell, chanting his incantations in a loud voice. At times he held the sword in one hand, treading the Dipper steps. At times he breathed flames from his mouth to purify the four directions. When Cui Hantang finished his deliverance ritual, he sheathed his sword and stood at attention. The talisman in his palm burst into flames of its own accord. He gave a great shout: "The Lord of Mount Tai has thrown wide the Ghost Gate! Why have you not yet been reborn?!" Suddenly, a column of black vapor shot up from the platform, accompanied by countless piercing, ear-splitting shrieks. Within the black vapor, countless ghostly figures seemed to dance... The spectators trembled all over. The more timid sat down in fright, covering their eyes with their hands. Moments later, the black vapor dispersed. Though the sky was clear and cloudless, a rainbow now stretched horizontally above the platform, resplendent in seven colors...

Those standing at the front of the audience felt a faint moisture in the air—subtle yet unmistakable—cool and comfortable beyond description, like sweet dew descended from heaven. They stood entranced. Those in the back rows, though unable to feel that "cool, fragrant" sensation, still discussed the rainbow with great animation. The young Daoist exhaled a turbid breath and said to his elderly companion: "Master, this priest possesses profound Daoist arts!" He turned to see his master's response, but found the old Daoist with eyes wide and throat making "heh-heh" sounds—he had nearly fainted from shock. The young Daoist hastily supported him, alternately thumping his back and rubbing his chest until the old man finally recovered, though he could only sit slumped on the ground without speaking.

Cui Hantang departed from the ritual platform. Then sixteen disciples mounted the stage—eight male, eight female. The spectators were wondering what sorcery would be performed next when they saw the disciples form two rows, clad in blue practice uniforms that made them look sharp and capable. Standing proudly among them with sword drawn was a tall, green-robed Daoist—none other than Fu Meng, the Elder who had joined just in time.

Music immediately issued from the loudspeakers. Elder Fu gave a long whistle and drew his longsword, loosening his topknot. As the music played, he danced gracefully, dancing and singing. The disciples joined with clear voices:

*I grieve in divine sorrow, loosening the reins toward Fusang.*
*Gently I stroke the long sword, jade pendants chiming, raising my cup to drink the Turbid River.*

*High I fly in peaceful soaring, pure breath commanding Yin and Yang.*
*Roaming all about, among stars and Milky Way unending, sun and moon together shining.*

*Green clouds my robe, white rainbow my sash,*
*My long arrows shot at the Heavenly Wolf...*

Fu Meng had a martial arts background. A set of Taiji sword forms mixed with square-dancing moves, performed by him, was dazzling beyond description. The Elders who didn't know the backstory couldn't help but voice their admiration: "How dashing and handsome! When did New Daoism acquire such a figure?"

"First it was playing at ghosts and spirits, now it's turned into a variety show. Just what is this Archpriest Cui doing?" Mu Min watched the memorial scene—what trace of solemn dignity remained? The whole thing had become a temple fair.

While this side of New Daoism was putting on a lively show, the Buddhists across the way were not to be outdone. Cymbals clashed, and the monks chanted sutras in unison. They performed "flower forms" and other entertainments, which also attracted many spectators.

The Catholics, however, had only the elderly nuns from the Lingao Convent dressed in black robes singing hymns—their entertainment value was much diminished. And conducting an open-air Mass lacked the mysterious atmosphere of a towering, cavernous cathedral. Though the newly appointed Bishop of Guangzhou, Ma Yangchun, exerted himself to the utmost, performing the full Requiem Mass with "the most supremely solemn bearing," few attended. Only a few hundred Guangzhou church members stood below participating in the Mass.

"While relatives still grieve, strangers have already begun to sing. Such is life, nothing more." Liu Xiang assumed a pose of deep contemplation.

"This memorial ceremony is one thing, but bringing in the Three Great Religions for this performance—the Senate might..." Lin Baiguang felt some concern.

"Teaching through divine means is merely for the education of the masses," Liu Xiang said. "At this stage, the cultural level of the masses is universally low. Having some religious belief to educate and restrain them is still quite useful. I believe the majority in the Senate can understand this—as long as we don't publicly declare support for any particular denomination. Chief Mu," Liu Xiang called her name.

"What is it?"

"Next, Archpriest Cui will be conducting an eighteen-day Grand Luotian Jiao at the Temple of the Five Immortals. Assign some National Army soldiers and police to help him maintain order. And make sure to count the days carefully—not one day fewer!"

Mu Min knew Liu Xiang intended to needle Archpriest Cui—conducting eighteen consecutive days of jiao ritual would surely make him vomit blood. But the Archpriest had flesh aplenty; he could probably endure it. Suppressing her laughter, she replied: "Understood. I will definitely assist him and supervise him."

"Alright, that takes care of the memorial. Next comes the trial phase." He looked at Shen Ruiming. "How do you plan to arrange it?"

"First, regarding personnel composition: the presiding judge will be Liang Xinhu. I will serve as prosecutor myself, with young Elder Zhang as my assistant. Do you have any other requirements? Should we arrange for associate judges or jurors?"

"Associate judges and jurors—I don't think that's necessary. We fundamentally follow the civil law system; jury trials are from the common law tradition. Moreover, given social conditions, that would essentially be giving local gentry a green light to interfere with the judiciary."

"You're a woman—in traditional concepts, women are always associated with benevolence and compassion. And you're also an Elder. Having you appear as defense counsel couldn't be more appropriate."

"To be honest, I really don't want to serve as defense attorney for these beasts—just reading the case files makes me want to vomit!" Zhang Yunmi still harbored some psychological resistance.

Shen Ruiming offered a few more words of encouragement. Liu Xiang and Liang Xinhu also cheered her on, which finally stabilized her emotions.

Today's meeting was essentially a "director's conference"—a thorough review of the trial procedures for tomorrow's public trial of the thirteen principal defendants, ensuring the best possible effect.

All the legal documents, including opening statements, indictments, and defense briefs... even confessions and witness testimonies... had been carefully revised. Shen Ruiming's requirement was: "No loopholes, no logical problems, complete in every detail."

The first two points were relatively easy—after all, they had solid evidence and weren't fabricating false cases. But "complete in every detail"—those four words were difficult. The prisoners had endured countless torments, tortured to the brink of death and back, all to extract memories of specific details.

The prisoners had all privately accepted a deal: confess and follow the trial procedures. In exchange, Shen Ruiming guaranteed them two things: first, they would not be subjected to death by a thousand cuts; second, after death, their bodies would not be handed over to Cui Hantang for disposal. The latter prospect seemed to frighten these cold-blooded killers even more than the former.

Nevertheless, Shen Ruiming still insisted on preparing contingency plans, particularly for gathering evidence from witnesses and physical exhibits—in case any defendant suddenly recanted or if testimonies contained discrepancies.

"This is our first lesson in modern law for Guangzhou—indeed, for all the people of the Ming—a legal education. Mere success is not enough. Our standard is 'perfect and flawless!'" Shen Ruiming declared.
