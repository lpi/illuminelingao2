# Chapter 884 - Model H-800

"This is our designed H-800 model. As the name suggests, it's an 800-ton ship. It's a pure sailing ship with three masts, using Chinese-style rigging."

Shi Jiantao continued his introduction: 

"The H800A removes one mast to become a two-masted ship, with a small boiler installed at the stern to drive a steam winch; the H800A1 removes the boiler again and installs a cannon on both the fore and aft decks; the H-800S is a steam-sail hybrid..."

Functionally, they could be further divided into subtypes: specialized agricultural/mineral bulk carriers, liquid transport ships, standard cargo ships, and mixed passenger-cargo ships. The design implemented modular concepts, making modification and repair easy.

"Besides the most common H-800 series, there are also H-500, H-1300, H-2000..." As Shi Jiantao spoke, he placed the Harmony Wheel full series manual compiled by the Hong Kong Shipyard on Wu De's table. Each ship type had beautifully drawn line diagrams, renderings, and technical parameters. This immediately attracted Wu De's attention.

He flipped through the album carefully. If they could really mass-produce transport ships like "dropping dumplings" as Shi Jiantao boasted, the Planning Commission's biggest headache—transport capacity allocation—would be greatly alleviated.

Wu De came from a fishing background and had served many years in the navy, so he knew a little about shipbuilding. He saw that these Harmony Wheels shared a common basic hull form, and many had identical hull cross-sections, facilitating standardized production. Just like the A320, A319, and A321 airliners in the original timeline were just different lengths with slight engine power differences.

The hull of the first-generation Harmony Wheel was designed based on a type of small wooden cargo ship built by Japan at the end of WWII. In the mid-war period, American submarines pushed into the Western Pacific, attacking Japanese merchant ships. Unlike Britain, which grouped merchant ships into convoys to face the U-boat threat (making whole into parts), Japan broke up the whole into parts, building tens of thousands of wooden transport ships to scatter across the ocean for Americans to catch.

Although most of these wooden ships were eventually blown to pieces by American Catalina patrol planes and carrier-based aircraft, measured by Lingao's industrial foundation, this was still a design with excellent practicality, manufacturability, seaworthiness, and damage resistance. Moreover, the operating environment was the same sea area from Southeast Asia and China to Japan, and the cargo to be transported was largely similar.

Of course, the Harmony Wheel Shi Jiantao and others developed wasn't a complete copy of the Japanese design. Considering this time-space had almost no qualified ports and docks, and most river mouths and bays used as ports had shoals and hidden sandbars, ship draft shouldn't be too deep. Currently, the ships they needed were primarily for coastal transport, going at furthest to the Korean Peninsula, Vietnam, Siam, and Japan. The ship form adopted a wide, flat-bottomed, shallow-draft type—similar in effect to the "flyboats" the Dutch used extensively on their routes. While striving to carry more cargo, they minimized draft depth to maximize use of natural harbors and ensure easy refloating in case of grounding.

Regarding power, as "Class B Shipbuilding," Shi Jiantao knew well that the Hong Kong Shipyard couldn't be allocated high-grade items like high-horsepower marine steam engines and fire-tube boilers. The Japanese had mainly used "hot bulb diesel engines," but Lingao currently could neither build diesel engines nor had diesel. So the power Shi Jiantao chose for the Harmony Wheel was still sails.

Considering that for some time to come, Harmony Wheels would mainly be used in the Zhejiang and Dengzhou operations, plus some incidental coastal trade, they adopted Chinese-style sails which were more efficient for coastal sailing and saved manpower.

However, the "Chinese-style sails" used on the Harmony Wheel were designed according to blueprints provided by the elder club "Junk Rig Association." These designs actually came from years of accumulated experience by 20th-century Anglo-American junk rig enthusiasts, combined with modern aerodynamics and structural mechanics. They used canvas, winches, blocks, pulley systems, and modern craftsmanship, and had undergone simple wind tunnel testing. Their reliability, maneuverability, and efficiency were higher than traditional Chinese sails.

Shi Jiantao had found several specialized research and design works on Chinese sails by Europeans and Americans in Lingao. Originally he wanted to set up a dedicated sail laboratory in Hong Kong, but met explicit opposition from the Grand Library, Ministry of Science and Technology, and the Navy: the sail laboratory must be located in Lingao. According to the Elder Council's resolution, any research department involving technological development could not be located outside Hainan Island.

However, Zhou Ke, in charge of the Lingao Shipyard, had no interest in setting up a sail lab. Though completely ignorant about sails, Zhou Ke worshiped European rigging and sneered at junk rigs. Naturally, he wasn't willing to lead any sail laboratory. Shi Jiantao looked everywhere until he found the Ministry of Technology. The Ministry had a Central Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in the Gaoshanling area; in their view, a sail lab was essentially a wind tunnel lab.

Finally, based on the Fluid Dynamics Lab's test results, Shi Jiantao selected a suitable Chinese sail rig as the Harmony Wheel's sail type.

Shi Jiantao used the opportunity of returning to Lingao to promote the Harmony Wheel to perfect the design of the ship, Chinese rig, and control systems. Prepared with a full set of blueprints and process data, Shi Jiantao was full of ambition, waiting only for the Planning Commission's final approval.

Although the Harmony Wheel followed the guiding principle of structural simplicity, its specific design and construction concentrated various new technologies the Transmigration Group was promoting in this time-space: iron keels and ribs, assisted manual steering wheels, improved Chinese rigging, hand-cranked winches... It even utilized a "iron-clad wood structural material" they had previously only used in construction. For certain structural members bearing high loads that used to require large, hard timbers, using "iron-clad wood" structure allowed splicing multiple pieces of wood together, or using inferior wood types. The iron sheet provided extremely high tensile strength. This iron-clad wood material was a very common building and ship material in old time-space America, Germany, Northern Europe, and Russia. The Lingao Construction General Company had also extensively used iron-clad wood I-beams in buildings. It was once criticized by the *Lingao Times* as "new time-space tofu-dreg projects," until a group of architects from the Construction General Company stormed into the newspaper office and gave Dingding a "loving science education," finally clearing its name.

"How long is the construction cycle for your ships?" Wu De asked after finishing the album and technical data.

"For the H-800 standard model, if all parts are manufactured, assembly to launch and commissioning won't exceed 60 days. Later with proficiency it'll be faster; final assembly time won't exceed 30 days." Shi Jiantao had specifically visited Lingao Shipyard this trip to observe the construction process of Project 901 ships, which claimed to be ready for use in 90 days. He believed that following his approach, completing final assembly and launching a standard Harmony Wheel in 60 days was no problem.

"Then where do you plan to produce these parts?" Wu De asked. He knew the Harmony Wheel production concept: parts manufactured in branch factories everywhere, with Hong Kong just for final assembly. Saying 60 days to complete construction probably already hid some buffer.

But in 20th century America, doing this was possible—Americans had the largest, most complete industrial system of the time. Although Lingao in this time-space also had the world's largest and most complete industrial system, it simply couldn't provide such massive production capacity.

Currently, production tasks at Lingao's various factories were already at full load, especially the main raw material supplier for wooden ships: the Wood Processing Plant. Their ship timber production line was already running 24-hour shifts; it was unlikely they could supply raw materials for Hong Kong Shipyard. Clearly Shi Jiantao could only rely on Hong Kong's own timber processing plant. But that factory was very weak in both capacity and technical level.

"I plan to use local Cantonese capacity." Shi Jiantao finally threw out his plan.

Hong Kong Shipyard's Phase I project lacked a full set of parts supporting enterprises. Aside from a timber processing plant as a major supporting facility, all kinds of metal parts, cables, canvas, putty, grease, and paint depended entirely on Lingao supply. Shi Jiantao's calculation was: gradually expand the local Guangdong parts supply ratio. Raw materials with low processing difficulty or requiring little processing would be procured locally from Guangdong first—for example, filling putty was just lime, hemp fiber, and tung oil, completely outsourceable to Guangdong for manufacture. For parts, start with the Harmony Wheel's wooden structural components, letting local Guangdong shipbuilding workshops provide support.

But this wasn't an easy task. Shi Jiantao had conducted field visits to several shipbuilding workshops near Huangpu. Seeing the crude tools and components, his heart had almost sunk to the bottom.

However, after carefully observing their construction process, Shi Jiantao discovered that although the shipwrights' work was very rough and they had no blueprints, they built ships strictly according to certain patterns. The ships built followed several standard types.

Clearly, modular ship manufacturing wasn't alien technology to them, but something that had existed for a long time. Asking them to mass-produce the same component shouldn't be difficult. Looking at *Common Indigenous Ship Types of the Guangdong Coast* compiled by the External Intelligence Bureau, ships larger than 100 tons came in only seven or eight types. Hull structures between same-model ships were almost identical.

But subsequent in-depth observation poured a bucket of cold water on him: the tolerances of various ship parts made by shipwrights were scarily large—or rather, in their eyes, the concept of tolerance didn't exist.

Of course, given the crudeness of the tools they used and the lack of specific numerical dimension concepts—everything being in their heads—manufacturing parts within allowable tolerances in bulk was impossible.
