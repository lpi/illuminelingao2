# Chapter 1297 Dengzhou Aftermath

The rebel generals were beheaded and executed one by one in front of the lined-up rebel troops—the Joseon executioners on the island were not enough, so experienced executioners were specially recruited from the rebels. For a time, blood flowed like a river on the drill ground, and the three armies trembled with fear. After the executions were finished, the heads were packed into boxes and then transported to Qimu Island.

Feng Zongze did not watch this spectacular execution scene. He was still immersed in his role as the "Seraph of Justice". Especially since he had practiced this set of glorious and righteous lines for a long time, allowing him to fully enjoy the addiction of melodramatic acting.

The order to execute all the rebel generals came directly from the Engine Operation Command, although some people believed that Kong Youde and others had once risen up against the Qing and there were compelling reasons for their final surrender to the Manchus. Moreover, Kong and Geng had high command ability and tactical levels, and could completely serve as the vanguards of colonial armed forces in Southeast Asia—sent to Vietnam or other Southeast Asian regions to plague the local natives.

However, this proposal was rejected after discussion by the Executive Committee and the Senate Standing Committee. To absorb the old Dongjiang troops, these high-ranking generals could not be retained. This was the first reason. The second was that Lu Wenyuan and others had engaged in many shady secret transactions with Li, Kong, and others during Operation Engine. Only Li, Kong, and others knew about these things. In order to ensure the legitimacy of the future regime and not give future conscientious historians an opportunity, such things must be completely erased.

Using them to attack Southeast Asia, without sufficient control and logistical support for their troops, would either result in total annihilation due to non-acclimatization or being bought over by a certain native power, instead becoming an enemy of the Senate. Even if they carved out a world of their own, they would absolutely not obey the orders of the Senate.

Moreover, this army that withdrew from beneath Dengzhou City was not only mostly the direct subordinates of Li, Kong, and others, but also a pack of wolves that had killed until their eyes were red and drank their fill of fresh blood during the Dengzhou turmoil. They must be given the greatest mental shock to make them "know fear".

After watching the executions, the nearly twenty thousand rebel troops were escorted in batches for purification and screening. All the family retainers, personal soldiers, and servants of the generals were separated and detained alone. After purification, they were all sent to Sanya to serve as miners. Ordinary soldiers were organized into "Labor Brigades". The first three years would not count towards points. Starting from the fourth year, points would be calculated according to workload to allow for self-redemption. The craftsmen, sailors accompanying the army, and the population abducted by the rebels were settled separately as immigrants after purification.

On the third day after the rebels withdrew from Dengzhou, Sun Yuanhua's direct subordinate general Zhang Tao, who was the first to receive the news, led his army to arrive at Dengzhou first. Subsequently, the troops of the Shandong Field Headquarters also surged in like a tide, and the recovery of Dengzhou was declared.

In order to avoid conflict with government troops eager to grab credit and territory, Zhu Mingxia had already led his troops to withdraw from Dengzhou in advance, leaving the empty city to the government army.

After the executions on Jeju Island ended, Feng Zongze sent a fast boat to transport the head boxes and some prisoners back to Qimu Island and hand them over to Lu Wenyuan.

Lu Wenyuan sent people to secretly return the head boxes of Li Jiucheng, Kong Youde, and others, as well as the former government army generals who were spared their lives, to Sun Yuanhua as credit for Zhang Tao and others. As for other heads, they were sold to various government armies.

The various government armies of the Shandong Field Headquarters were originally worried about only getting an empty city—even if they wanted to kill good people to claim credit, there were no commoners for them to slaughter. Now that someone was selling rebel general heads, they came one after another to make purchases. As for the rebels' excess flags, documents, seals, and generals' weapons and armor which could be used as "military merit" items, a part was given to Sun Yuanhua and Zhu Dadian, and a part was sold publicly: clearly marked prices, no deception for young or old.

Besides "selling", Zhu Mingxia also "bought". He purchased the population, goods, and livestock looted by the Shandong Field Headquarters government troops within the camp—in fact, in terms of actions, the various government troops of the Shandong Field Headquarters were not inferior to the Dongjiang rebels in plaguing the common people along the way. It was just that because there was somewhat restraint from superiors, the scale of killing and looting was smaller, and the frequency was less. Zhu Mingxia's camp was bustling with noise day and night, and various generals sent people to "do business".

Note that during this period, there were inevitably some generals who didn't know the ferocity of the Qimu Island side and attempted to forcefully seize heads. As a result, after eating a fierce meal of musket fire, they all honestly acted according to the transaction regulations.

Zhu Mingxia priced the heads according to identity: for ordinary rebel soldiers, one tael of silver bought ten. For the remaining generals, the price increased incrementally starting from squad leader according to official rank. The higher the status and the greater the fame, the higher the price. If everyone wanted to buy a certain head, they could also bid against each other. From this, a small fortune was made.

Not only that, the firearms used by the Qimu Island village braves also attracted the attention of the generals of the Guanning garrisons. They had already seen this kind of firearm with a part of the government army in Laizhou. Now experiencing its power personally, they came to Zhu Mingxia one after another to get close, wanting to know where the bird guns were obtained.

Zhu Mingxia sent a few naturalized citizen cadres from the commerce department to receive them, and gave them a few Type 30 revolvers and Nanyang-style rifles as samples, expressing that as long as they could pay, they could get more.

Lu Wenyuan paid a visit to Zhu Dadian and Sun Yuanhua at the original Dengzhou Governor's Yamen.

"Mr. Lu is indeed not an ordinary person. I didn't expect such great depth in your chest!" Zhu Dadian's expression was indeterminate. Having the first merit of recovering Dengzhou taken by Zhang Tao, a subordinate general of Sun Yuanhua who was still a criminal awaiting punishment, and the militia, inevitably made him, the "Prime Minister" assisting in suppressing Dengzhou, lose face. But at least Dengzhou was overcome before the arrival of the New Year, which was like sweet rain to the Emperor who was eagerly looking forward to good news. Furthermore, this also somewhat redeemed his face from the previous collapse of the siege under the city walls.

"I dare not, it was all due to Lord Zhu's proper scheduling in the center, Lord Sun's personal command, and the generals' brave advance that Dengzhou could be overcome. Lu is just a fly attaching to a swift horse's tail. A tiny bit of merit is not worth mentioning." Lu Wenyuan bent his waist and said respectfully.

Sun Yuanhua nodded secretly. Fellow believer Lu spoke very appropriately. These days, he was already very clear about the origin and purpose of this Fellow believer Lu. He knew that for him to be able to escape from the disaster of total annihilation this time, this mysterious Manor Lord Lu and the power behind him had contributed greatly.

He was an old hand in the officialdom. This knowledge was hidden in his heart and never revealed to outsiders. If someone mentioned Manor Lord Lu and Qimu Island, he would just pretend to be confused.

Zhu Dadian nodded. He heard that Manor Lord Lu's people were selling rebel heads, and couldn't help but feel quite relieved about him: preferring to cash out heads that could be exchanged for merit and official positions into silver showed that the other party had no great ambition and was satisfied with being a local tycoon. Now hearing these words, he felt more and more that this Mr. Lu was quite sensible, did not claim credit with arrogance, and did not fight for merit. He had a great sense of the big picture.

"Manor Lord Lu is truly a model for the gentry of Dengzhou and Laizhou." Zhu Dadian said, "This student will definitely request merit and commendation for the Mister."

"I dare not, I dare not." Manor Lord Lu pretended to be even more humble, "Although Dengzhou and Laizhou are not this lowly person's native place, it is also where this lowly person resides. The two rebels Li and Kong plagued Dengzhou and Laizhou. For the Imperial Court and for the hometown, it is only right for this lowly person to do so."

Zhu Dadian turned his face sideways: "Lord Sun, look..."

Sun Yuanhua knew that it was not appropriate for him to grab credit with Zhu Dadian at this time. Anyway, the fact that Zhang Tao entered the city first was already set in stone. Not to mention that Manor Lord Lu provided the heads of the main rebel generals. No one could snatch this credit away. He was in a great mood at the moment. He smiled and said: "Having a strong man like Manor Lord Lu available is Lord Zhu's tiger prestige, and even more a blessing for the Emperor and the Imperial Court."

Lu Wenyuan hurriedly added another flower to the brocade: "Lu has already prepared fifty thousand catties of foreign potatoes for military needs, all as a contribution—although it is a drop in the ocean, I also ask the two Lords to accept it with a smile."

These "two Lords" didn't know what "foreign potatoes" were, but they knew this must be grain. Although the quantity was not large, getting grain under Dengzhou City, which was covered in ice and snow and full of broken walls and ruins, was already a top-notch good thing. Immediately after another round of praise, they "accepted it with a smile".

With the war over, there were still many aftermath matters. Dengzhou was already in ruins, with no commoners left. There were still a large number of bones that needed to be buried. The Imperial Court had to allocate money and grain for relief and send local officials, all of which would take time. Zhu Dadian discussed with his aides: considering that since Manor Lord Lu had grain in hand and tens of thousands of people, and Qimu Island was within the territory of Huang County, a subordinate county of Dengzhou, it would not be impermissible for him to come forward to handle the aftermath—appointing local gentry to be responsible for the aftermath after a war was a very common practice in ancient times. Furthermore, in the current Dengzhou and Laizhou area, apart from Laizhou which still had gentry, the local gentry of Dengzhou had almost been swept away. Even if they survived by luck, their families were broken and people were dead. Immediately, an appointment letter was issued, appointing Lu Wenyuan as the Acting Officer of the Dengzhou Aftermath Bureau. Responsible for the aftermath work in the Dengzhou area.

Lu Wenyuan accepted it happily. With this official title, whatever he did in the Dengzhou area would be justified. Now, as a local tyrannical power, they had obtained the recognition of the government and had full freedom of action.

Since Dengzhou had been recovered, and this place was extremely broken, not only was there no settlement for grain, even housing was insufficient. After Zhu Dadian and Sun Yuanhua discussed how to write the victory report, they led the Shandong Field Headquarters to return to Laizhou for stationing. Sun Yuanhua led his troops to station on Mishen Mountain. There were still many corpses remaining in the city that had not been encoffined. As for the Governor's Yamen, it was even more dilapidated and simply could not be entered for stationing.

As for the Three Men of Qimu Island, they also divided the work. Chen Sigen returned to Qimu Island to watch the house and continue to be responsible for peripheral reconnaissance work. Lu Wenyuan and Zhu Mingxia stayed in Dengzhou to prepare for the aftermath matters—it wouldn't be fun if a plague broke out.

After experiencing this catastrophe, the livelihood of the surviving commoners in the three prefectures of Eastern Shandong would become even more difficult. Only by fleeing outwards could they survive. And the government's power in this place had also greatly declined, and it was no longer possible to make any forceful interference with the actions of the Qimu Island side. They could engage in population outflow openly and aboveboard—although the population loss in the three prefectures of Eastern Shandong was serious, the three prefectures of Western Shandong also suffered floods in 1632, resulting in a large number of refugees—as long as there was a way to live, naturally people would flock there.
