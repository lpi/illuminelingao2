# Chapter 88 - Layout

"Old Wu, you came!" Just as he was reading, Zhou Dongtian came in from outside. The training clothes he wore were covered with ink stains. In fact, he was a fire control officer before transmigration, and later a judicial worker, but because he was very familiar with printing affairs, he became the head of this printing room. Most of the equipment in the room was also purchased with his money.

"What, publishing a newspaper?" Wu De pointed to the proof sheet.

"Yes, the Executive Committee has approved Ding Ding's proposal to run a newspaper, but it's just an irregular tabloid. Fifty copies for the first issue."

"I think the positioning of this newspaper is wrong. Who is it intended for?"

"You think we don't know Marx?"

"Since it's for local people to read, why use simplified characters? Moreover, has the Executive Committee considered the issue of literacy rate?" Wu De thought this was really a joke. Take the 138 captives he managed as an example. Except for one Zhang Xingjiao who could read and write, only two or three small landlords knew a few characters. The illiteracy rate was as high as 95% or more. In such a social environment, isn't printing newspapers superfluous?

"We are about to start eliminating illiteracy for your labor team soon," Zhou Dongtian pointed to the computer over there, "The Culture and Education Group has already produced the first draft of literacy teaching materials. We also plan to do lithography and make some literacy cards."

"Really can think of everything."

"It's all Ding Ding's ideas," Zhou Dongtian chuckled, "This reporter really can think, very ambitious. Besides running a newspaper, he also wants to engage in textbook publishing."

"Having ideas is good. By the way, this is the draft. Help me print it out as soon as possible."

"For this little bit of stuff, I can use the printer to cut wax paper for you and it will be out. Just wait a moment." Saying this, he went to turn on the computer. Wu De's draft was written on a computer and transmitted directly to OA via wireless network, saving even the effort of typing on the computer.

"Since there is a computer network, why print documents? Red tape!" Wu De lamented.

"Probably to leave a written archive for the future. Computers will break one day." Zhou Dongtian adjusted the machine and clamped the wax paper, "In another ten years, probably these things will have to be handwritten. I also brought an old-fashioned Chinese typewriter. If the machine breaks, I count on it to cut wax paper."

After mimeographing the materials, as usual, a copy had to be left for the Intelligence and Data Group for archiving. He went directly to talk to several main leaders of the Executive Committee.

"You mean the captives are not very at ease?" Wen Desi asked.

"Yes, and some people probably will never be at ease." Wu De pointed to his trend report, "According to the latest report, those small landlords, rich peasants, and middle peasants who have their own homesteads, because the busy farming season is coming soon, cannot go back to work, and worry about their families, so they have always been impetuous."

"There shouldn't be many such people."

"Correct, but ordinary tenant farmers also have similar problems. If they don't harvest grain, they can't pay rent, and the life of themselves and their families is not guaranteed."

"En, en."

"The ones who truly feel they can live anywhere are only those destitute households or long-term laborers without family burdens."

"So, not many people are willing to submit to us." Wen Desi was a bit discouraged.

"Yes, actually we are attractive to poor people, especially after we launched the 'employee' treatment. At least for those who used to work long-term jobs, working for us is much better than working for old moneybags. But for tenant farmers and poor peasants with a little family property, it may not be so—what they care more about is 'living a stable life'—actually, these people have concerns about 'how long the red flag can be kept flying'."

"Before we achieve greater victories or legal status, I'm afraid this concern cannot be eliminated." Xiao Zishan also appeared very disappointed.

"Even if there are concerns, it must be pushed forward." Wen Desi considered for a while, "Remember the predetermined policy? 'Beacon Effect'. As long as everyone sees that working for us can live better, they will naturally incline towards us—common people still look at the immediate present more."

"I agree with this. As long as tangible benefits can be given, common people will not forget."

"Also, those eight Li captives are still detained in the captive camp and have not been incorporated into the labor team. How does the Executive Committee plan to deal with them?"

"We are preparing to use them as a breakthrough point to establish certain relations with the Li caverns in the south." Xiao Zishan explained, "Mu Min is doing this work. Results will come out in a few days."

The implication was that this matter was not within your scope of inquiry. Wu De nodded. Just as they were talking, Wen Desi's Xiaolingtong rang. Someone said something on the phone. Wen Desi said: "Let them wait first, treat them well. We are coming right away." Said to Wu De: "Local people have come to visit us."

"Oh?" Wu De became interested.

"It's for the captives' matter. You come with us. By the way, bring Xiong Buyou too. And who else? The local translator, call them all."

"Okay, I'll go do it right away."

Since the disastrous defeat of the two counterattacks in the county, the situation in the entire Lingao county seat became tense again for a time. Hearing the fleeing militia say that the pirates' firearms were very powerful, killing a patch with one shot, and even the famous Huang Family Stockade militia of this county were defeated, and even Huang Shoutong himself was seriously injured and carried directly back to Huang Family Stockade. People in the city were in panic. Some gentry were already transferring property and population to remote relatives or their own manors. Others lied claiming family matters or physical discomfort, and resigned to go home one after another. Even refugees hiding in the city wanted to leave the city—rumors said this group of short-haired pirates would come to wash the city for revenge.

After tossing for a few days, seeing that the 'Kun' bandits had no intention of attacking the city, the officials and gentry finally settled down a bit. Because the loss was too great, internal quarreling began for a time. The attack originally thought to be planned seamlessly failed disgracefully, proving Licentiate Liu's so-called bandit suppression strategy completely useless. Some people gossiped that Licentiate Liu was a scholar talking military affairs, misleading the court above and the hometown below, angering Liu Dalin, who was already in poor health, half to death—ending up like this after working hard for a month. His health was not good either, so he resigned to go home to recuperate.

Magistrate Wu was angry but couldn't stop it. He sulked in the flower hall every day, and worried. It had been nearly a month since the pirates landed. Until now, they showed no intention of retreating. The gentry also lost trust in him. The hearts of the people in the city were scattered. If the 'Kun' bandits came to attack the city, I'm afraid those archers and militia would disperse in an uproar immediately. As for the prefectural city, up to now, apart from sending a letter asking him to "guard the city carefully" and other nonsense, they reminded him that the court's autumn grain collection was imminent, asking him to supervise this matter with all his strength.

"Collect grain, collect grain, it's a mess now, what grain to collect!" Wu Mingjin was full of resentment. After thinking about it, he had to ask Master (Shiye) for advice.

This Master Wang, named Zhaomin, was from Guangdong. He had been in the private secretariats of various prefectures and counties in the province for many years and was very familiar with the local ways.

Master Wang pondered for half a day and whispered: "East Host (proprietor/employer), since we are powerless to expel the bandits, the only way is to negotiate terms (Xing Kuan)."

"Negotiate terms?" Magistrate Wu was frightened and almost jumped up to scold it as absurd. But after all, he had been immersed in local officialdom for many years, and immediately calmed down.

"Is it feasible?"

Master Wang stroked his beard and smiled: "This can be considered an expedient measure. The most urgent matter right now is autumn grain! As long as we can collect the autumn grain of this season, naturally the world will be peaceful. Pirates, they are making trouble in Fujian and Guangdong provinces, can't they make trouble here?"

"Yes, yes, Old Sir is right." Magistrate Wu felt suddenly enlightened, but suddenly he frowned, "Just this matter, fear cannot be hidden from the superiors, and the Factory Guards (secret police)—" Saying this, he subconsciously looked around.

"East Host doesn't need to worry too much. In officialdom, one less trouble is better than one more trouble. As long as autumn grain enters the warehouse and the county seat is not lost, why would the Prefect bother with these? Others are the same." Master Wang whispered, "With the momentum of the 'Kun' bandits, if they wanted to take this county seat, they would have taken it long ago. Why build a camp and live at Bairen Beach? They neither loot nor kill in this county, quite having the style of benevolence and righteousness. We can consider it buying peace, deal with it for now."

"Reasonable, reasonable." Wu Mingjin nodded repeatedly, "But this matter is no small matter after all—"

"East Host rest assured," Master Wang looked confident, "I'm afraid the ones anxious to negotiate terms with the 'Kun' bandits are not us, but those gentry." Saying this, he lowered his voice and said a lot more.

Sure enough, the gentry were worried about their harvest. Some because people from their village stockades were missing in the "bandit suppression", all thinking about contacting the pirates. Here Master Wang gave a slight hint, and everyone went to prepare these things on their own.

After discussion, the representative sent by the gentry was a declining landlord in the county named Zhang Xingfu (Note: Source says Zhang Xingfu here, but later Zhang Youfu. Wait, context check: "张兴福" vs "张有福". Later text uses "张有福". I will use "Zhang Youfu" to be consistent if it appears more often, or check if they are different people. But likely same person. Let's check next chapter. Chapter 89 uses "张有福". So I will use "Zhang Youfu"). Because his father was a gambler and ruined the family almost completely, leaving him only a hundred or so mu of sloping land, purely depending on heaven for food. Because his wife's maiden family had a little relationship with Liu Xiang's family, and he could speak with various groups of people active nearby, he was often entrusted by others to deal with pirates, negotiate prices, ransom hostages and such things. Although all parties didn't trust him completely, they had to find him to speak in the middle when things happened. He himself also used this identity to make some extra money and get some rewards.

The people who came with him were either the steward of some family or a distant clansman of some family. The gentry were afraid that if they came themselves, they would be detained by pirates for extortion, so they sent some unimportant people. All brought gifts, carrying pigs, sheep, and gifts, holding visiting cards to pay a visit. On the cards, following the custom of social intercourse among peers of the scholar-official class at that time, they humbly called themselves "侍生" (Shi Sheng - Student/Junior).

Walking out of the county seat for less than half a shichen, seeing earthen ramparts and towers in front from a distance, they knew the pirates' main camp had arrived. These pirates had landed for more than a month. Everyone only heard their name but never even heard their voice. Many people knew that they defeated the strongest militia in the county in a moment, and even Huang Shoutong was beaten down. However, hearing that the pirates had good discipline made them somewhat at ease.
