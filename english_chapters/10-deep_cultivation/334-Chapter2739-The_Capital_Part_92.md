# Chapter 2739: The Capital (Part 91)

"Whether they bought them cheap or picked them up on the street, they're all your Delong notes. You bankers have a rule: for bearer notes, you honor the note, not the person. No matter how they got the notes or what they intend to do, when they bring them to your counter for redemption, will you redeem them or not?"

Leng Ningyun thought: This Prefect Zhong has gone straight to the heart of the problem. To put it plainly, his reserve funds were far from sufficient.

"Once we open, we naturally have to redeem. A merchant's most important asset is credibility."

"But you just said yourself—you can't pay it all!" Zhong Lie heaved a long sigh.

"Yes, if we're talking about silver in my bank, fully redeeming all the deposit slips and notes in the market is indeed beyond our means. However, the market belongs to everyone. If they really run Delong into the ground, I fear it will greatly affect people's livelihoods in the capital."

"How so?"

"Consider, Your Honor. Most of Delong's deposits naturally come from the gentry. When they come to withdraw, for self-preservation, I must give them priority, not daring to short even a single fen of interest."

Zhong Lie nodded. This was natural.

"But besides the gentry, many small merchants and ordinary people also deposit with Delong for interest. Once the silver is exhausted, I can only close shop. As for what happens to them, I don't know. Even if I went to prison and gave up all my assets, I couldn't compensate the common people." Leng Ningyun spoke very sincerely. "Common people work their fingers to the bone, selling their sweat and blood for a few coins. They deposited them with me for a little interest. If their principal is lost, how can I live with myself?"

This wasn't just about losing deposit principal and interest. The truly destitute, who stopped working when they stopped eating, had no spare money to deposit for interest. Those who would be hit hardest were the capital's many small and medium merchants. They had some spare cash, deposited in banks or large shops for interest, to earn a bit extra for household expenses. During tight times, they'd also withdraw for working capital. If Delong collapsed, it would be a devastating blow to these small and medium merchants. The capital's market would certainly be greatly affected. Many would hang themselves or jump into wells; even more would become beggars or starve. The chain reaction would be a severe blow to people's livelihoods.

Zhong Lie wasn't a bookish fool ignorant of worldly affairs. He of course understood the dangers.

"Heh, heh. Who knew Grand Manager Leng had such a kind heart!" Zhong Lie said sarcastically. Then he pondered a moment and said, "So, it would be better to keep you sealed?"

This sounded like an invitation to discuss. Leng Ningyun saw an opening. He immediately said, "If we remain sealed, though there won't be a run, the deposit slips and notes outside will be worthless paper. The result would be the same."

"Unsealing won't do, sealing won't do—what exactly do you intend?"

"There are still a few days until the market reopens. During these days, I'll do my best outside—mobilizing funds and persuading colleagues to support me." Leng Ningyun spoke very sincerely. "I also need to ask Your Honor for a favor."

"Oh? How can I help you?"

At this moment, Leng Ningyun felt confident. What he feared most was meeting stubborn officials with mediocre abilities—unreliable at handling matters yet convinced of their own righteousness, so set in their ways that eight horses couldn't pull them back.

Prefect Zhong wasn't such an official. Though he had a reputation for integrity, he could also adapt to circumstances. As long as facts and reasoning could persuade him, cooperation was possible.

Now he became even more composed. "Thank you, Your Honor!"

His request was simple: on the day of unsealing, please have Shuntian Prefecture send runners and clerks—and if Magistrate Liu could come personally, even better—to maintain order at the scene.

"...On unsealing day, first, there will certainly be a run. Without people maintaining order, there might be stampedes. Second, to prevent anyone from stirring up trouble and inciting civil unrest."

"That's easy. Lord Liu surely won't refuse." Zhong Lie nodded. "But if you cannot redeem when the time comes, I'll have no choice but to seal you again—and this time, it won't just be sealing the shop!"

"Yes! I understand!"

"Second, I'd like to request Your Honor to issue a red-posted proclamation in Shuntian Prefecture's name."

"Oh?" Zhong Lie had to become more cautious. A red-posted proclamation was an official government document whose wording required great care. If something were inappropriate, once it was stamped and posted, ten oxen couldn't pull it back.

Though maintaining market order and keeping the peace were routine official duties, this matter was far-reaching. If it triggered civil unrest, Shuntian Prefecture would inevitably share the blame. Any hint of favoring Delong in the proclamation would be material for the censors' impeachment!

After thinking, he immediately ordered an attendant: "Please invite Secretary Lin."

Secretary Lin had actually been listening to his employer and Leng Ningyun's conversation from beneath the window. After all, Grand Manager Leng was currently at the center of a storm. The slightest mishandling could greatly affect his employer's career and reputation.

Having listened this far, Secretary Lin felt Leng Ningyun's words were generally reasonable and his requests not excessive. But his confident claims about "mobilizing silver" certainly lacked substance. When his employer summoned him, he immediately appeared.

After exchanging greetings, Zhong Lie said, "Secretary Lin, to maintain the market, we cannot avoid managing this Delong matter. Now Grand Manager Leng proposes that Shuntian Prefecture issue a proclamation to help maintain credibility. I need your input on this."

"Yes, yes! Your Honor is most thorough!" Secretary Lin, as Shuntian Prefecture's secretary, naturally received some consideration from Delong. For a secretary serving a "clean official" and a capital official, Delong's monthly "customary fee" of a few taels and the "festival gifts" at the three major holidays were welcome supplements.

He'd originally been quite willing to help Delong—after all, compared to Shanxi House, Manager Leng was far more generous. If he could help, future gratitude would certainly be substantial. But Delong's situation was too complicated; he had to be cautious.

"Trouble for you."

"I wouldn't dare, I wouldn't dare," Secretary Lin bowed. "But what content should the proclamation contain? Please instruct, Your Honor."

"On that, first ask Grand Manager Leng, then we'll deliberate."

Leng Ningyun quickly said, "My apologies for troubling you, Secretary Lin! The Delong matter is naturally my responsibility, but we also need everyone's help to consider the overall situation! In my humble opinion: first, state that Delong is a proper merchant establishment with excellent reputation from years of operation; second, that the manager was recently held by bandits, hence the temporary closure, and now that the manager has safely returned thanks to official rescue, the shop is reopening; third, that Delong has ample assets with no risk of collapse; fourth, that the money trade has wide connections, and market turmoil that affects the market isn't good for the capital's people, so please don't spread rumors or make a scene. I ask that you convey this message clearly to everyone."

Secretary Lin was extremely clever. By the time this was said, he'd already drafted something in his mind. But he didn't immediately go to the desk to write. Instead, his eyes turned to Zhong Lie to gauge his opinion.

Zhong Lie understood his meaning. Of these four points, the second and fourth were fine. The key points were the first and third.

Originally, the first point wouldn't be a problem. A large establishment that had operated in the capital for years couldn't be called treasonous. Besides, the shop was the shop; the person was the person. After Grand Secretary Yan's downfall, the shops under his name simply changed owners and kept operating right through to the Chongzhen era.

But Delong was different. Anyone with status in the capital knew that Delong had an unclear, ambiguous relationship with the "Short-Hairs" rebelling in Liangguang.

If this sentence appeared in the proclamation, it would mean that Zhong Lie of Shuntian Prefecture was personally guaranteeing Delong wasn't "rebel property" and that Leng Ningyun had no connection to the "Short-Hairs."

The liability here was enormous. If nothing happened, fine. But if something did, it would be ready-made material for the censors to pick apart!

As for "Delong has ample assets with no risk of collapse"—that also sounded like making guarantees. If Delong failed, Zhong Lie's reputation would be severely damaged.

At this moment, Secretary Lin wanted to help Leng Ningyun. After careful thought, he said, "Your Honor, Manager Leng isn't an ordinary merchant. He holds an official title..."

A clever person needs only a hint. Zhong Lie was immediately enlightened. Whether this Manager Leng was a fake Short-Hair or a real Australian, his "Nanjing Imperial Academy Student" title was genuine! The Ministry of Rites even had his three-generation ancestry record! Even if he were a Short-Hair, that would be the concern of the Nanjing Imperial Academy and Ministry of Rites—what did it have to do with Shuntian Prefecture!

As for "Delong has ample assets," Secretary Lin had ideas too. He drafted the proclamation immediately and presented it to Zhong Lie for review.

Zhong Lie stroked his beard and read it carefully, nodding slightly, then signaled for the draft to be shown to Leng Ningyun.

Such proclamations often used colloquial four-character phrases—plain language that read almost like doggerel. Leng Ningyun could understand it:

"Delong Bank, excellent reputation, wide network, ample resources. Times are troubled, bandits run rampant. Shop owner detained, fortunately escaped. Safely returned, doors reopen. Business as usual. Owner's oath: silver is sufficient. Any shortfall, the law won't forgive. Shuntian Prefecture decrees: Market peace, citizens should heed. When Delong opens, notes will be honored. Merchants and common folk, no need for panic. Heed not rumors, come redeem together. Those who incite unrest bear full responsibility. Lawless scoundrels spreading fear, those who agitate in secret, once caught, will be severely punished. Heartfelt words, consider yourselves warned! This decree is absolute."

Leng Ningyun silently admired Secretary Lin's formidable pen. The third point had directly transformed Shuntian Prefecture from "guarantor" to "regulator"—thoroughly distanced.

"I think it's very appropriate. Secretary Lin truly wields a wonderful brush."

"I wouldn't dare. Matters concerning Shuntian's markets and merchants require caution."

After Secretary Lin withdrew, Zhong Lie studied Leng Ningyun for a while and said, "Your requests—this office has done what it can for you. The coming storms you'll have to weather yourself."

"Yes. I will certainly steer carefully and sail the ship for ten thousand years. I won't fail Your Honor."

In Zhong Lie's eyes, a hint of appreciation flickered, then vanished.

"Whether you fail me isn't important. Just don't fail the merchants and common people who deposited money in your shop!" With that, he raised his teacup.
