# Chapter 2566 - Seeking Help

As they say, people have three urgencies. During the meeting, Zhang Xiao had drunk several cups of tea and held in a full bladder. By the time Liu Xiang started his lengthy speech, he felt he could barely hold on any longer. As soon as the meeting ended, he rushed to the toilet.

"Ah, what relief." After emptying his bladder, Zhang Xiao shuddered several times, sighing with pleasure toward the ceiling. Fastening his belt, he sauntered out, washed his hands, and commented: "Didn't expect the toilet standards here to be quite decent. Old Liu really does care about education."

The accompanying orderly smiled: "This is the National Model School—it's the face of our Guangzhou City. Mayor Liu puts great emphasis on it."

Zhang Xiao thought to himself that this orderly was quite perceptive. He strode toward the door, but just as he reached the entrance, he got quite a fright.

He saw a person in Ming dynasty attire kneeling at the men's toilet entrance. Though wearing a large cap, the person had delicate features—almost like a woman in men's clothing.

"Holy crap, what's going on here? Could I have encountered that classic 'stopping the sedan to plead for justice' scene?" In a split second, Zhang Xiao's mind had cycled through countless classic scenes from period dramas he'd watched before. A bully takes a fancy to a poor family's beautiful daughter and wants her for himself. The girl already has a sweetheart and refuses to the death. The bully colludes with the government to force her parents to their deaths and kills her lover. Just when heaven and earth both fail her, an upright new county magistrate arrives to take office. The girl escapes, happens to encounter the magistrate arriving at his post, stops the sedan to cry injustice. The magistrate is filled with righteous indignation, deploys his wiles to maneuver against the local bully, ultimately bringing the villain to justice and winning the beauty. It's just that the location for stopping the sedan was outside the men's toilet—that would be rather unseemly if written into a biography later.

The orderly reacted quickly, immediately stepping forward to block Zhang Xiao, and barked: "Who are you? Why are you blocking the way here?"

"This humble commoner is Zhang Jiayu. My mother is gravely ill, her life hanging by a thread. I beg the Chief to be merciful and save my mother." With that, he kowtowed heavily to the ground.

So it turned out this "stopping the sedan to plead" person was none other than Zhang Jiayu. He and his society friends had already discussed the petition plan thoroughly. Requesting an audience directly was out of the question—he was just an ordinary licentiate, not some local great scholar or worthy, and nine times out of ten he'd get turned away at the door. The only option was to "stop the carriage and petition" when this Chief Zhang stepped out.

But the occasion required considerable thought. Intercepting the Chief in full public view could create moral pressure, making Zhang Xiao agree for the sake of winning hearts. But this approach might very well provoke the Elder's inner displeasure; he might even be arrested as an assassin by security before even seeing the Chief, achieving the opposite effect.

After much deliberation, waiting here at the Academy for an opportunity, petitioning when fewer people were around, seemed most appropriate.

After hearing his voice, Zhang Xiao quietly grumbled to himself: "Damn, it's actually a man. Looks like the naturalization haircut really is necessary. Zhang what-jade? Wait—Zhang Jiayu!"

Only then did Zhang Xiao realize this was none other than the historically famous Zhang Jiayu. He had previously read relevant historical materials, and at city government meetings Li Zhuoxian had also introduced the situation of the "Three Loyalists of Lingnan." He beckoned to the orderly: "It's fine, let him follow me."

Zhang Jiayu hadn't expected the new County Magistrate to be so approachable. The hope in his heart rose several more degrees. He got up and followed them to the Education Bureau office.

Inside the office, Zhang Xiao invited Zhang Jiayu to sit, but Zhang Jiayu knelt again instead.

Zhang Xiao found this somewhat headache-inducing. He was sick of reciting things like "in Great Song we don't do this"—he simply said: "A man's knees are worth gold. Why don't you get up!"

"No, Chief, I beg you to save my mother!" Zhang Jiayu said.

Zhang Xiao had no way with these single-minded ancients. He said: "Fine, if you want to kneel, then kneel. Your mother is gravely ill—why do you seek me out instead of seeking medical treatment?"

"My mother is seriously ill, and medicines have been ineffective. This humble commoner read in the newspapers that the Chief goes by the nickname 'Medicine Master,' so I came specifically to beg for medicine."

Zhang Xiao thought to himself: Liu Xiang's advertising effect is really good—it's only been a few days and already buyers are coming to the door.

"Tell me the details."

Zhang Jiayu then recounted the whole story. Honestly, Zhang Xiao had encountered more than a few cases of natives or naturalized citizens "seeking medicine" like this, so he had some knowledge of symptoms and conditions. He specifically inquired about the symptoms.

---

Hearing that he had obtained two yellowish-brown tablets from an itinerant doctor and that her condition had improved after taking them, Zhang Xiao became interested. As far as he knew, native medicines came in pills, powders, pastes, and decoctions—it was absolutely impossible to manufacture tablet formulations like this.

"Yellowish-brown tablets? What was the price? Where is this doctor now?" Zhang Xiao asked.

Zhang Jiayu panicked somewhat, fearing he had leaked information about that day's gathering. He answered vaguely: "Reporting to the Chief, I paid one tael of silver. The man was a traveling doctor with a bell—he's gone now, whereabouts unknown. If I could find him again and obtain this medicine, this humble commoner wouldn't dare trouble the Chief."

"Looks like oxytetracycline tablets that leaked out through some channel. I'll need to investigate this properly when I have time." Zhang Xiao thought. He remembered Jin Zhijiao telling him that the inventory accounts at the Danzhou pharmaceutical factory "had problems."

At the time, he'd been in a hurry to take up his post, and he also trusted the staff he'd personally trained, so he hadn't given it much thought—truth be told, leakage of this kind couldn't be entirely avoided at any time. Making it so that not even a single hair could slip through—that couldn't be achieved now, and even the old timeline with its most advanced management systems and technology couldn't achieve it either.

But hearing that medicine could also be bought in Guangzhou—that demanded his attention. Zhang Xiao stroked his small mustache. Setting aside the drug leakage situation for now, just regarding Zhang Jiayu's case: if his mother had ordinary pneumonia, it would be easy—a simple matter. But if it was tuberculosis, requiring continuous treatment with multiple antibiotics for over six months, and several first-line specific drugs like isoniazid and rifampicin couldn't be produced yet... The Senate's antibiotic varieties were mostly produced in batches at the Danzhou Pharmaceutical Factory. He knew the prices by heart—besides the internal transfer price supplied to publicly-funded medical care, commercial drug sales at their prices meant only wealthy tycoons like Gao Ju could afford to treat tuberculosis.

Though with his connections in the medical sector it wouldn't be hard to arrange, he'd inevitably owe other Elders a big favor. Moreover, quite a few Elders in the Senate were quite averse to collecting historical celebrities.

Zhang Xiao, being a hands-on technical person, was rather practical and didn't want to overstate things. He said: "Your matter is simple to say it's simple, difficult to say it's difficult. But you and I are complete strangers—I need a reason to help you."

Zhang Jiayu knew this was the County Magistrate naming his price. As for money—though not destitute, he wasn't from a wealthy family either, and the Australians built their nation on industry and commerce, so they didn't lack his few coins. As for reputation—his most distinguished status was merely a Ming dynasty licentiate, hardly any great figure. Helping him wouldn't bring anyone a "ten-thousand-people umbrella"—at most just his Zhang Jiayu's "grateful tears." As for people—the Australians recruited through civil service examinations regardless of what degree you held, showing no interest in former dynasty literati like themselves. And he wasn't some peerless beauty...

Could it be... He looked with trepidation at the mustachioed Zhang Xiao before him, feeling vaguely uneasy.

Zhang Xiao had originally worn a half-smiling expression, but seeing the young scholar before him suddenly show fearful alarm in his eyes, he realized his expression was rather greasy, carrying distinct implications of "surely you wouldn't want such-and-such." He quickly straightened his attitude and said with a serious face: "As long as you can give me a reasonable justification, I'll definitely help you."

Zhang Jiayu saw his solemn expression and relaxed. After much thought, he realized that only by helping this new County Magistrate govern well as a good "parent official" might he be able to move him. So he said: "This humble commoner's family has lived in Dongguan for generations. I am quite familiar with the popular sentiment in Guangzhou. Though untalented, I often associate with bold men of the greenwood, and I know some letters. If the Chief doesn't find me beneath consideration, this humble commoner is willing to serve like a dog or horse, at your command."

Zhang Xiao pretended to ponder. The analysis materials sent by relevant departments had said that among the "Three Loyalists," Zhang Jiayu was the one most likely to be useful to the Senate—it just required the right opportunity. Now the opportunity had come; he might as well do him a favor and go with the flow.

As the saying goes, the more easily something is obtained, the less it's treasured. Zhang Xiao didn't want Zhang Jiayu to mistakenly think that asking Elders for favors was such a simple matter. He needed to understand just how heavy this favor really was. So he asked: "Young man, do you know what you're asking for?"

"Medicine," Zhang Jiayu said.

Zhang Xiao shook his head. "It's not medicine—it's life! It's the right to survive! In this world, at any given moment, countless people need the same medicine, but production is limited. If someone else uses it, you can't. If you use it, someone else can't. How do you think it should be distributed?"

After Zhang Xiao broke through this thin barrier, Zhang Jiayu fell silent. He understood that what he sought might not be something priceless to Australian chiefs, but to others who sought it desperately, it was the difference between life and death.

Zhang Xiao continued: "A society must decide who will eat roast suckling pig and who will eat dirt. It must also decide who will ride in a Red Flag sedan and who will ride a donkey cart. The teachings of all the Hundred Schools of Thought all revolve around one core question: how should scarce resources be distributed? Daoists advocate that everyone eat dirt—at least let the common people only know that dirt exists in the world. Confucians advocate distribution by hierarchy from top to bottom—whatever class you're in, that's what distribution you get. Everything is predictable; whether eating roast pig or dirt, everyone can be calm about it. Legalists advocate 'from each according to ability, to each according to work'—implementing performance-based compensation. Buddhists advocate not competing in this life, accepting everything submissively, and in the next life you'll have unlimited resources. Since you've read the classics and histories extensively, you know that the governing principles of all dynasties are nothing but 'Confucian on the outside, Legalist on the inside,' mixed with Daoism and Buddhism. What the great Confucians preach about 'heavenly principles and human desires'... 'extending good conscience'... mouths full of benevolence and righteousness... heh." He gave a cold laugh.

Zhang Jiayu had read quite a few Australian books, but had never heard such an interpretation. He couldn't help but feel shocked—not because this insight was particularly world-shaking, but because of the Elder's attitude.
