# Chapter 2525: Empty Talk

Li Suiqiu picked up the teacup, took a sip to moisten his dry throat, and said, "When the Kun thieves first arrived, I only thought they were maritime merchants who knew some peculiar skills and trickery, and their purpose for settling in Lingao was just like the Franks in Macau. Back then, when the Purple Co. Australian goods first appeared in Guangzhou, I even bought an Australian mirror for my mother and wife. I didn't expect that later Governor Wang would listen to slander and insist on provoking them. I went to watch He Rubin's military parade in Guangzhou before his 'Expedition to Qiongzhou.' Who would have thought that not only would He Rubin's entire army be wiped out, but they would even fight their way to outside the Wuyang Courier Station and extort 300,000 taels of silver as city ransom? All the villages and towns below Guangzhou Prefecture were ravaged. Only then did I feel they were a group of pirates with sturdy ships and sharp cannons. Later, I heard that other pirates on the ocean were either suppressed or absorbed by the Australians, and they became the overlords of the sea. Only then did I realize these thieves are giant bandits with unfathomable intentions, far beyond the likes of Liu Xianglao and Zheng Zhilong.

"Later, at the East Gao Villa, I watched from the rockery as they built the 'Iron Ladder' all the way from the 'Great World,' with iron automatic carts puffing black smoke and white mist running on top. The Australians can be said to be pressing forward step by step. Who would have thought these pirates who are 'very good at doing business and work' would dare to use the banner of the Great Song to contend for the world!"

Li Suiqiu's brows were tightly locked, his face full of anxiety.

Kuang Lu had been away from home for several years and lacked much first-hand information, so he asked, "Does Meizhou [Li Suiqiu] mean that these people are not descendants of the Zhao Song?"

"Although their appearance resembles Chinese people, what they practice are entirely methodologies of the Far West. Could it be that descendants of the Zhao Song drifted to the Far West and lied about coming from Australia?" Li Suiqiu was also very puzzled about this. "Daoist Cui of the Temple of the Five Immortals often organizes small gatherings called 'salons.' I've been to them too. Although the Australians haven't said it explicitly, anyone with discerning eyes knows that Fatty Cui is a True Kun. The 'salons' at the Temple of the Five Immortals discuss everything from astronomy to geography, Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism classics. There are also demonstrations of various exquisite machines. Hot air balloons going up to the sky can overlook the prefectural city, and microscopes viewing water can see eighty thousand bugs in a drop of water. Many scholars with weak wills have already been bewitched by him."

Chen Zisheng said, "Although the theory of the Australians is similar to that of the Far West, I think the Australians are superior. Matteo Ricci said: 'The sky wraps the earth, so beneath the earth is all sky. A man's head tops the sky and his feet stand on the earth; the earth resides within the sky like a yolk in a chicken egg, yet surrounded by above and below on all four sides.' But Ricci believed the sky is a finite entity with the earth as the center, and above the earth there are nine layers of heavens, named 'Moon Heaven,' 'Mercury Heaven,' 'Venus Heaven,' 'Sun Heaven,' 'Mars Heaven,' 'Jupiter Heaven,' 'Saturn Heaven,' 'Fixed Star Heaven,' and 'Starless Crystal Heaven,' and above them are the 'Primum Mobile' and 'Empyrean Heaven,' with the sun, moon, and stars all revolving around the earth. The Australians, however, have a solar system model, with the sun as the center and everything outside the planets being void, which is far more concise than the Westerners' theory. Seasonal changes, solar and lunar eclipses, and various astrological phenomena can all be explained. Moreover, the Australians' ships are sturdier and their cannons sharper. If the Australians came from the Far West, why does no one in the Far West know the origin of the Australians?"

Li Suiqiu nodded. "What Qiaosheng [Chen Zisheng] says makes sense, but this is also what I am worried about."

"What do you mean by this?" Kuang Lu and Chen Zisheng asked in unison.

Li Suiqiu said, "When Western methods entered China, Xu Guangqi and others believed them deeply. Westerners say that sailing from the Far West to China, arriving at the place where day and night are equal in the map (Kunyu Wanguo Quantu), one can already see the North and South Poles, both level with the ground, slightly without height difference. When the path turns south past the Cape of Good Hope (Big Wave Mountain), the South Pole is already seen thirty-six degrees out of the ground, so the Cape of Good Hope and China are opposite top and bottom. The sun and moon run along the south and north lands and the twenty-eight mansions. When they are in the south, there are unknown stars, assumed to be revolving around the South Pole. The north has the Purple Forbidden Enclosure, Taiyi, and other phenomena, but why does the south not have them? Isn't this almost inverting the images of superior and inferior? How fortunate are people to be born near the North Pole, and how unfortunate to be born near the South Pole? Doesn't this still define the distinction between Hua and Yi, Chinese and foreign?

"Since the earth is round like a melon rind, taking the North Pole and South Pole as the melon's stem and navel, if looking at the rind from inside the melon, there is an object attached between the stem and navel, rotating with the melon body, then the place near the navel is the South Path. The closer it is, the narrower it gets. The place away from the navel and approaching the stem is the North Path, which must be wide and broad. Thus, on the day of the Summer Solstice, the day and night are equal in length; on the day of the Winter Solstice, the day and night are equal in length. But when it is short, why must it complete one day and night, exhausting this one-quarter of the three hundred and sixty degrees? They are still unaware of the absurdity of their theory, saying 'what is day above is night below.' Do they not know that with such a theory, the width and narrowness of degrees can no longer be even? And there must be a country where people's heads top the South Pole; when the sun runs to the Tail and Winnowing Basket constellations, it is just revolving in the sky without deviation or obstruction, so there must be no rising or setting height—wouldn't that be a long day without night (Polar Day)? And there must be another country where heads top the North Pole; at that time, wouldn't it be almost dark without day and night (Polar Night)? If it is as they say, above, below, and on all four sides are mountains, rivers, grass, trees, and people; where they live has no originally defined up or down. If we say there is no distinction between east, west, south, north, up, and down, then pushing this reasoning to the end, it's as if people are all hanging upside down in the world, and the positions of noble and lowly defined by the high heaven and low earth in the 'Book of Changes' can no longer be determined. If such theories flow into the world and cause disaster, making everyone believe them, in the future there will be no distinction between ruler and subject, superior and inferior, and the disaster will be endless. This is what I am worried about."

"What Meizhou says is absolutely correct," Chen Zizhuang, who had been silent previously, spoke up at this moment. "Whether it is Matteo Ricci's 'Map of Ten Thousand Countries' or the Kun people's 'World Map,' China is Asia, while the Western Ocean is Europa. I don't know the explanation for Europa; inferring from the Far West, it must be words exaggerating its greatness. As for 'Ya' (Asia), the 'Erya' explains it as: 'secondary.' 'Shuowen Jiezi' says: 'ugly.' 'Zengyun' says: 'few.' 'Xi' (fine/thin), 'Shuowen Jiezi' says: 'tiny.' 'Yupian' says: 'few.' Asia is a Western word; in Chinese, it means 'Secondary Small Secondary Continent.' The insult to China is extreme. Recent people discussing history often sneer at the Zhao Song for being weak. However, when Yuanhao changed his name to Wuzu, meaning 'My Ancestor' in Chinese, Ouyang Wenzhong submitted a memorial saying: 'The two words My Ancestor, what kind of language is this? My means me. Ancestor means what the vulgar call "Weng" (old man/father). If we allow him to claim this title, then in future imperial edicts, we must call him My Ancestor; this creates a situation where the court calls a barbarian thief "My Father." I don't know who dares to open such a mouth. Moreover, when the barbarian thief composed this name and title, he deliberately wanted to insult and toy with China. Now, from Yuanhao down, for names and official titles, they all use barbarian terms and follow barbarian rites in everything; how can they use Chinese only for this title? Being a subject to me, yet making me call him Ancestor—we should use this to refute him, begging to reject and not listen to it.' Yet people today willingly accept insults and disrespect from Westerners and Kun people without realizing it. Why has not a single person realized their treachery?" He finished with bursts of sighing.

Seeing his elder brother sigh, Chen Zisheng stood up and bowed to Chen Zizhuang and Li Suiqiu, somewhat ashamed. "Thanks to the teachings of the two elder brothers, this foolish younger brother previously only felt the Australian theories were exquisite and failed to see through their intentions. I am truly ashamed."

Li Suiqiu said, "Both Westerners and Kun people measure the calendar by the sun, so they imitate the circular rotation of the north and south paths as a round instrument, like a copper ball. This does not contradict the theory of the canopy heavens, but assumes the earth is in the center of the sky. Westerners and Kun people stubbornly believe China is extremely small while Europe and Australia are extremely far and large. Inferring from the canopy theory, then the earth is larger than the sky, so they have to invent the Globe Theory to extend their argument. It is fortunate, very fortunate, that Qiaosheng knows this and is not confused by it!"

Chen Bangyan was on good terms with Chen Zisheng on ordinary days. Although he had corresponded with Chen Zizhuang, this was still the first time he met him. Seeing that everyone had formed some consensus, he said, "Gentlemen are indeed knowledgeable, and this student admires you. In this student's humble opinion, the induction between heaven and man concerns the safety of the state. The interpretation of celestial phenomena has been controlled by the imperial family throughout the dynasties, establishing the Directorate of Astronomy to specialize in it, prohibiting others from meddling. Now the Kun people teach without discrimination, teaching children with hair in tufts the methods that were not taught in past dynasties. Moreover, their theories teach people meanings of no superior or inferior, no ruler or subject, no noble or lowly. The spreading poison is not shallow; it is truly a method to use the barbarian to change the Chinese. Their hearts are punishable."

Li Suiqiu said, "In my opinion, what the Australians scheme for is not just these rivers and mountains of the state; regarding the path of Sage Studies, they instead disparage it constantly, showing a great intention to invert heaven and earth."

"Could it be that the Kun thieves really want to rule the country as merchants?"

"Merchants ruling the country is not necessarily true. It's just that it won't be us."

"It is truly inconceivable." Kuang Lu, having lived outside for a long time, knew very little about the situation in Guangzhou and exclaimed, "Since Dong Zhongshu, all dynasties without exception have taken Confucianism as the foundation. It has been a thousand years since the Sui Emperor. Duke Wenzhong of Zhao Song (Wen Yanbo) once said to Shenzong, 'Your Majesty rules the world with the scholar-officials, not with the common people.' Only the Mongol Yuan rarely selected scholars through imperial examinations, so their distinct destiny lasted no more than a hundred years. The Taizu Emperor rose from common cloth, drove out the Tartars in the north, and restored China. For more than two hundred years of establishing the state, none could do without the heart's blood of scholars. Since the Kun people claim to be descendants of the Song Dynasty, do they not understand this principle?"

"They naturally understand the principle, but people have different learning." Chen Bangyan paced in the hall while speaking: "It is heard that when the Kun people first arrived in Lingao, they had the land of one ship and a crowd of no more than hundreds. Yet within a few years, they gathered a crowd of one hundred thousand, swept away the government army, and occupied Qiongzhou. The people followed them happily. Have you heard of any contribution from scholars in this? their obscure skills and cunning tricks turn stone into gold, their ships are sturdy and cannons sharp; have you heard of any contribution from scholars in this? Today, in the governance of Guangzhou, the citizens praise it with one voice; have you heard of any contribution from scholars in this? The Kun people's so-called 'Good Governance' is governance that does not share the world with scholar-officials yet can still govern! The matters of Guangzhou are but a reappearance of the Qiongzhou story!"

Chen Bangyan's words forced everyone present to face the question they had subconsciously tried to avoid: the Kun people were already, or were about to become, a separatist regime contending with the imperial court, and they were not in this system. Of course, whether they were willing to join this system was another matter.

Thinking of the sentence the Kun people said most often after entering the city, "Stand up, don't kneel! My Great Song doesn't practice this!", they really couldn't imagine how a separatist regime with no superior or inferior, no ruler or subject, no noble or lowly, and deviating from the Confucian concepts engraved in their bones for decades would operate.

What made them even more maddened was that in the current situation, they seemed to have done nothing wrong, yet could do nothing, or had even done nothing at all.

If an Australian Senator witnessed this meeting, he would definitely send them a quip: "Inconvenient truths, the certain fate of human mortality, and women's mustaches are three things we would rather ignore."
