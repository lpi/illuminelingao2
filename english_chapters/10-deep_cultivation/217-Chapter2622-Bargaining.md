# Chapter 2622: Bargaining

Besides plague, smallpox was the number one malignant infectious disease in this space-time, even capable of influencing whether the Manchus would enter the pass to plunder. Therefore, it was a key point of the Senate's prevention. As early as when the Fubo Army was conquering cities and capturing lands, work teams opened "Vaccination Bureaus" in major rural markets, persuading villagers to vaccinate against smallpox through forms like local folk art and village theatrical performances. Generally speaking, the vaccination situation was relatively optimistic. Mainly because Jiujiang was located on a traffic thoroughfare with many passing merchants, smallpox occurred frequently locally, and villagers suffered deeply from it. Adults with smallpox scars on their faces actually accounted for one-third. Therefore, the proverb said "giving birth to a child only counts as half; only after having smallpox does it count as whole." In recent years, with the development of vaccination work, the phenomenon of infants dying from smallpox infection decreased significantly. Many silk banners were already hung in the Vaccination Bureau, indicating that the Senate's hygiene work had obtained recognition from some villagers.

But the educational cause was not so optimistic. Besides entering government schools to study, scholars participating in the Ming Dynasty imperial examinations had private schools and clan schools run by various places and clans. With Confucian classics as relatively unified textbooks, traditional education teachers were numerous, forming an education industry of considerable scale.

The Senate abolished imperial examinations and implemented new-style education, but was severely trapped by insufficient educational resources, lacking new-style education teachers, and new-style schools were also severely insufficient. As a large county ranked top in the Pearl River Delta, Nanhai County had a population of hundreds of thousands, yet surprisingly only one National Model School was built in Dali. A region with prosperous culture and education like Jiujiang didn't even have one new-style school. This was equivalent to cutting off the future of the vast majority of scholars, and trouble would happen sooner or later.

The opinion of the Education Department was that besides providing teacher and financial support to those suitable for adapting into junior primary schools, for the massive existence of private schools (*Sishu*) and community schools (*Shexue*), just like in Hainan initially, their existence's legitimacy would be recognized and not banned. However, promoting the cultural level grading examination; as long as one could pass the Level B Cultural Certificate, it would be equivalent to junior primary school academic ability. At the same time, fully selling government-subsidized junior primary school textbooks, striving for these community schools to use these textbooks. Simultaneously, opening free short-term simple teacher training, conducting new-style education training for private school teachers and scholars willing to be teachers, issuing "Simple Normal School Certificates."

But these policies were still slightly too complex for local big clans. After abolishing the imperial examination system, they were at a loss. Without imperial examinations, how could scholars advance?

Therefore, many nearby big clans wanted to invite Zhang Xiao to stay in the clan for a short time, also planning for the family's future. After being declined by Zhang Xiao, the clan heads, seeing they couldn't move the Magistrate, all came to Jiujiang Great Market preparing to offer advice.

In the marching tent, Zhang Xiao sat on the marching chair with legs crossed, holding the ear of a large glass mug. The brownish-yellow tea stains on the cup wall implied that this cup had been used for a not short time. The words "For the Senate and the People" were printed on the outer wall of the cup. He blew on the tea in the cup, took a small sip to test the temperature, then closed his upper and lower teeth to block the tea leaves in the cup, gulping down all the tea water. Unfortunately, two tea leaves stuck to his front teeth. Zhang Xiao picked them off with his hand and threw them back into the tea cup.

The gentry in the tent saw this in their eyes. No one dared to complain, but all felt it was truly insulting to gentility.

Pre-Ming Longjing tea sent by Hangzhou Station was Zhang Xiao's favorite. A cup was also placed before the natives sitting on both sides. The gentry who came were all elderly people. Letting them talk non-stop for half a day without rewarding a mouthful of water was really unjustifiable.

Guan Boyi also sipped tea, moistened his throat, and said in Guangdong-accented Mandarin with a slightly hoarse voice: "Parent Official has good taste. This tea is fragrant and sweet, mellow and smooth entering the throat. After drinking, one feels a kind of Great Harmony *Qi* filling between teeth and cheeks. It should be excellent West Lake Longjing." Other gentry also followed with a few words of praise.

Guan Boyi was the current patriarch of the Guan Clan's Shimei Hall. His younger brother Guan Jiyi was a *Jinshi* of the same year as Chen Zizhuang, and now was also in a state of resigning from office and returning home, closing doors and not coming out. But for the future of the clan, Guan Boyi still supported his old bones to come to Zhang Xiao's tent.

Guan Boyi said again: "Student is bold to plead for young talents to the Parent Official. Hope Parent Official submits a petition to the court to restore imperial examinations to select talents to serve the country, not letting down the ten-plus years of hard work of tens of thousands of scholars in Lingnan."

"My Great Song Senate returns to the Divine Land to reconstruct Huaxia and rescue the myriad people. You rest assured, the Senate's door is always open. We don't refuse any collaborators, just—" Zhang Xiao dragged out his voice and said, "Must follow our rules."

After the Senate occupied the Two Guangs, many people still held lucky psychology, thinking imperial examinations would be restored before long. But in a blink of an eye, more than two years passed, with no sign of restoration at all.

Song Guowei, the patriarch of the Song clan, said carefully: "Parent Official spares no pains at the beginning of taking office, going down to the countryside to experience people's feelings; truly the fortune of the locality. The National Dynasty runs new schools and implements new laws; the atmosphere is renewed. We are all rejoicing and encouraged. However, this township is located in a remote area. Looker generations have no fate to study at Nanhai National Model School, unable to serve the National Dynasty. Hope Parent Official conveys our sincere hearts to the court."

"I understand all your intentions. My trip indeed has the intention of inspecting new school site selection," Zhang Xiao put down the glass tea cup and said, "However, now a hundred wastes wait for revival; expenses are needed everywhere. Training tens of thousands of troops consumes a thousand gold daily. Guangzhou plague caused city closure for months again. The Senate sympathizes with people's suffering, not only collecting little tax but also exempting taxes for many small merchants. Last year, great drought in spring and summer, great snow at year-end; the Senate opened barns for disaster relief again. Take this Vaccination Bureau; it is also free vaccination now, taking not a penny. Although the Senate possesses the Four Seas, it cannot conjure silver out of thin air. Whether this school can be built depends on the sincerity of everyone present."

Since ancient times, wealth shouldn't be revealed. Upon mentioning silver, gentry naturally wanted to cry poverty. Zeng Xingxiang, the patriarch of the Zeng clan, said tremblingly: "Parent Official examine clearly. According to Student's knowledge, this township has about seven hundred plus *qing* of earth and fields. Tax per *mu* of field is three *sheng*, land two *sheng*, pond and Monk Summer (*Seng Xia*) all five *sheng*. In the tenth year of Wanli, Magistrate Zhou Wenqing went down to the countryside to clear and measure fields. Bowmen (*Gongshou*) saw ponds and lands embroidered and interlocking in the township, difficult to analyze in detail. Reporting to Wenqing, then implemented 'Mixed Measurement' (*Hun Zhang*) method. Later the whole county had a deficit of one thousand eight hundred twenty-eight *qing*. Each *mu* added fake tax one *fen* six *li* four *hao*, named Fixed Bow (*Ding Gong*). Jiujiang begged for exemption from addition due to 'Mixed Measurement.' Before long public criticism boiled, eventually not obtaining exemption. All forts suffered the addition of one *fen* six *li* four *hao* together; didn't expect this township to additionally suffer the burden of mixing two *sheng* as five *sheng*."

Wei Bifu had already told Zhang Xiao about "Fixed Bow Fake Tax," but didn't expect Jiujiang to have some "Mixed Measurement" story. Zhang Xiao waved to Huang Xiyin and asked in a low voice: "What is the Mixed Measurement method they talked about?"

Huang Xiyin leaned over and explained in a low voice in Zhang Xiao's ear: "When Zhou Wenqing cleared and measured fields in the Wanli period, he felt Jiujiang's ponds and lands were hard to distinguish, so he simply taxed them all as ponds. Those fields and lands originally not belonging to ponds also became ponds on the Fish Scale Book. The tax quota for ponds is far higher than fields."

"Oh—" Zhang Xiao nodded and said to the gentry: "Fixed Bow Fake Tax is indeed unreasonable. This is accumulated abuse of the previous dynasty. You cooperate well with the Senate to re-clear and measure fields, paying tax according to actual fields. But regarding the Mixed Measurement matter, fifty years have passed. In the Wanli period, this place was still ponds and lands embroidered and interlocking, hard to distinguish. Now I see Jiujiang is already fish ponds eight out of ten, fields two out of ten, truly worthy of the name."

This change from the Wanli period to the late Ming showed that the expansion speed of Jiujiang fish raising ponds was extremely fast. Of course, this was also produced under the stimulation of Zhou Wenqing's clearing and measuring policy. If not changing fields and earth into higher-yielding mulberry dike fish ponds, people owning land would face serious burdens or even losses.

Zhang Xiao also found in the inspection that in the late Ming Jiujiang area, there was no trend of mulberry dike fish ponds replacing fruit dike fish ponds. The core problem facing dike-pond agriculture at this time was still the development of low-lying areas and the development of the pond fish farming industry. Crops like mulberry, fruit, and rice were all in a trend of expansion rather than mutual substitution. Whenever it involved raw land development, the efficiency of small farmers was far inferior to organized groups like clans and agricultural reclamation battalions.

Seeing the gentry silent, Zhang Xiao said again: "You rest assured. My Senate doesn't like engaging in zero-sum games. Making the cake bigger is our style. As long as you follow the Senate with peace of mind, the Senate won't let you suffer losses."

This string of new terms confused the old men. Huang Xiyin happened to have discussed relevant topics with Zhang Jiayu before, so he stood out to explain: "Magistrate Zhang's meaning is, the Great Song Senate possesses various advanced technologies. As long as you all hold a sincere heart towards Great Song, the Senate can make you plant more grain, raise more fish, and produce better cocoons. Your payment at present is the harvest of tomorrow."

Guan Boyi said: "Student is untalented, willing to listen with respectful attention."

"Old Mr. Guan, is the Fish Flower (fry) industry of this township mostly managed by your clansmen?" Zhang Xiao finished speaking and flicked open a folding fan with one hand, fanning a few times in front of him. The pure white fan face had no ink painting or poetry, only written with a few plain big words—Air Conditioning is Better.

Guan Boyi didn't know what Zhang Xiao meant, answering carefully: "It is indeed so. After Huang Xiaoyang's rebellion in the previous dynasty, Dan households escaped completely. West Sea fish tax had no place to settle, so it fell on the villagers of this township. Ration silver all comes from West Sea Fish Flower. My clan has strict family style; successive generations all prioritize completing tax and grain payment. After the National Dynasty changed the mandate, we haven't delayed or owed either."

Zhang Xiao asked again: "Since so, do you know how many Fish Flowers Jiujiang catches every year?"

Guan Boyi said: "Like stars filling the sky, uncountable."

"Wrong," Zhang Xiao closed the fan and patted it on his hand, corners of mouth rising, saying: "There are one hundred and fifty thousand *mu* of ponds in Nanhai County. Calculating based on stocking one thousand two hundred plus fish fry per *mu*, about one hundred and eighty million Fish Flowers are needed. Although these hundred and fifty thousand *mu* of ponds are not all mulberry dike fish ponds—there are still many Sky-Gazing Ponds and Wild Ponds with stocking amounts less than mulberry dike fish ponds—Jiujiang Fish Flowers act as far as Fujian, Guangdong, and even Huguang. In this way, the annual Fish Flower production of this township should be no less than two hundred million tails. Considering the loss in Fish Flower catching, transportation, and farming, the annual catch amount should be no less than three hundred million tails. Is there any error in what this County said?"
