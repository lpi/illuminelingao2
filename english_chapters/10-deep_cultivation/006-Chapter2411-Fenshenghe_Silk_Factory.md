# Chapter 2411: Fenshenghe Silk Factory

He imitated the master's manner, gave a light hum, and lifted the covered tea bowl to gently brush aside the tea leaves, looking with some satisfaction at his nephew who stood there at a loss and somewhat fearful.

It was a long time before he coughed and said, "Sigh, sit down."

"Yes, yes."

"It's not that I, as an uncle, am boasting. That the Nansha Chen Clan could allow peace this time acts solely on my negotiations with the Australians to protect the peace of this area!" Speaking of this, he couldn't help feeling triumphant. "If nothing else, without me, could the Australians have come to this Nansha Village to set up a sericulture pilot project? Could there be Australians specially sending troops to patrol? Could they specially organize and drill village braves for our village?"

Chen Lin didn't know what to say, so he could only echo with a few "yeses."

"Worthy Nephew, presumably you heard that I took over the weaving workshop when you came back this time, and you must have some resentment in your heart..."

Chen Lin quickly stood up and said, "Dare not, dare not. This weaving workshop was originally the property of the Upper Three Branches—speaking largely, it is also the clan's property. Since my father is gone, it is only right and proper for Second Uncle to take over. How could Nephew dare to resent it? Besides, the current situation is chaotic and confusing; Nephew is young and cannot cope with it! Even if Second Uncle let Nephew take over, Nephew doesn't have this ability."

Chen Xuan looked him up and down with some surprise and said leisurely, "Worthy Nephew, you didn't go to Guangzhou in vain this time—you've improved a lot!"

Chen Lin blushed to his ears, wishing he could crawl into a crack in the ground from embarrassment. But at this moment, he couldn't think too much, so he said immediately, "In the past, Nephew was young and ignorant. Second Uncle, you have a great heart, please do not blame me."

"You and I are close uncle and nephew, connected by broken bones and tendons. I am an elder; how could I blame you?" Chen Xuan was fully satisfied. "What plans do you have for returning home this time?"

Chen Lin dared not say anything like "reorganizing the family business" or "opening a cotton spinning factory" now, and could only cover up, "Now Nephew is a person who has lost his father. Although Guangzhou is good, it is not home after all. Nephew came back this time wanting to rely on the Ancestral Hall to have a place to settle down."

"Well said." Chen Xuan nodded. "Now after the great catastrophe, a hundred things are waiting to be done. It is exactly the time when people are needed. You were originally familiar with the weaving workshop and stayed in Guangzhou for quite a few days—presumably, you have also seen quite a few Australians..."

"I haven't seen Real Australian Senators, but I have seen some naturalized citizens under their command."

"It's good that you've seen them." Chen Xuan said, "There is a suitable job right now."

Only then did Chen Lin know that his family's weaving workshop had indeed been eyed by the Australians. The Australians had now specially sent some people over to operate it jointly with the Chen family weaving workshop, engaging in some "Rural Sericulture Improvement."

"...You have stayed in Guangzhou and dealt with Australians. The job of receiving and dealing with Australians is handed over to you."

Chen Lin was greatly surprised. To tell the truth, he didn't expect Second Uncle would actually "reuse" him. He speculated subconsciously, "This, isn't it appropriate?"

"What's inappropriate?" Chen Xuan put on a face of "great generosity" and said, "We are close uncle and nephew. I don't have a son; won't the whole family property belong to you juniors in the future! You help me run the weaving workshop well, and your benefits will be indispensable in the future!"

"Yes, yes, thank you, Second Uncle, for your cultivation!" Chen Lin stood up with a face full of "tears of gratitude" and immediately bowed to the ground.

Chen Xuan was not acting hypocritically in this way. Back then, relying on his elder brother, he was also a manager in the weaving workshop. But he indulged in pleasure and didn't care about the weaving workshop's affairs, fishing for three days and drying nets for two. Regarding raising silkworms and weaving, he could only be considered slightly better than laymen. In empty talk, he seemed to know a lot, but once entering actual operation, his true form was immediately revealed.

Since starting "cooperation" with the Australians, Chen Xuan gradually felt his ability falling short of his wishes. Moreover, as the time of cooperation with the Australians increased, he found their "plans very large," and his own ability was difficult to adapt.

Although the craftsmen of the original weaving workshop had mostly returned to work, after he fell out with Third Brother, Third Brother went to Sanliang and took away several lower-level managers and crucial craftsmen. Although it barely started work now, the efficiency of the weaving workshop was far inferior to before. Since the Australians started the joint silk factory with him, it had been almost half a year, and production had not yet entered the right track. The Australians were very dissatisfied.

There were quite a few people under him who flattered him, but none were familiar with the weaving workshop. Now that Chen Lin had returned, he had to rely on him.

Chen Lin couldn't figure out Second Uncle's bottom card at this moment, but since Second Uncle was willing to use him now, he might as well push the boat with the current and take a look at the situation of the weaving workshop—incidentally, also find out the background of the incoming Australians.

Chen Xuan asked about Chen Lin's place to stay. Chen Lin originally wanted to stay in the Ancestral Hall, but seeing that Second Uncle treated this place as his old nest, it was better for him not to be here.

"Nephew's house is completely destroyed now and has no suitable place to go. I prepare to go to Fifth Brother Ji's house to borrow lodging."

Fifth Brother Ji was Chen Qing's father. He was from a branch of the Lower Five Houses. His family was very poor, but the person was honest and dutiful.

"Ah Ji's house—his family is too poor. Although there are a few empty rooms, I'm afraid you won't eat or sleep well there... Never mind, I'll send someone to send some money and rice to him in a while."

Coming out of the Ancestral Hall, Chen Lin's heart went up and down, pondering the next countermeasures. To tell the truth, he couldn't quite figure out Second Uncle's true intentions: from his conversation, it could be seen that he probed him everywhere and was very wary, but wanting him to work for the weaving workshop didn't seem fake. What medicine was sold in Second Uncle's gourd?

He followed Chen Qing back to his home, told Fifth Brother Ji kept and his wife that he would stay here for some more days, and gave a few taels of silver as expenses. Fifth Brother Ji naturally agreed profusely. Not long after, Chen Xuan also sent clan servants to deliver two *dan* of white rice and a few strings of cash, saying it was for Chen Lin's lodging expenses. He also instructed him to go to the weaving workshop tomorrow to contact the Australians. Fifth Brother Ji and his wife, having received money and rice and with their son safely returned, were happy in their hearts. That night they killed a chicken and bought wine, making a good meal to entertain the uncle and nephew. Chen Lin also asked his sister Chen Yue to move here to live too, so they could look after each other.

Early the next morning, he came to the weaving workshop.

This weaving workshop was located by the river at the east end of Nansha Village. It was originally a silk hong opened by Chen Lin's grandfather, named Fenshenghe, specialized in purchasing raw silk from silkworm farmers in the four countrysides and then selling it to traveling merchants. Because business had always been good, various branches of the clan also successively invested a lot of money into it. Plus Grandfather's painstaking management, Fenshenghe gradually made a name for itself. By his father's generation, they began to distribute raw silk to households in the village and nearby for weaving. Subsequently, they bought looms from Guangzhou and began to set up their own workshop for weaving.

This weaving workshop was renovated and expanded by his father ten years ago. The scale was more than double that of Grandfather's time. Standing in front of the gate at this moment, Chen Lin felt both sad and gratified.

Sad that Father's life's blood and sweat had fallen into the hands of outsiders like this! Gratified that this weaving workshop survived the war; although the walls had traces of fire, the overall preservation was good. Two long white wooden plaques with ink calligraphy were hung on the sides of the gate—this was not unfamiliar to Chen Xuan [sic: should be Chen Lin, contextually] who had experience traveling in Guangzhou: Australians did things this way.

The one on the left was "'Fenshenghe' Silk Weaving Factory," and the one on the right was "Nansha Sericulture Improvement Institute."

*At least the shop name is kept,* Chen Lin thought.

But looking closely, there were many changes in the courtyard. First was the steps entering the door, which had turned into a slope. The stone threshold of the gate was also gone. Two village braves were added to stand guard in front of the gate.

In the past, water bandits ran rampant locally. Because the workshop piled up raw silk, silks and satins, and silver money, it was a target coveted by bandits. So the courtyard walls built back then were particularly high and thick. Now at the corners of the courtyard walls, corner towers were built with bamboo and wood, hanging clappers and lanterns, with village braves standing sentry on top. Although the gate was wide open, two layers of chevaux-de-frise could be seen inside.

With such strict defense, the Australians were obviously very concerned about this weaving workshop. He thought, no wonder Second Uncle would let himself come to help in the workshop; with his bit of ability, he obviously couldn't cope.

A red brick chimney seemed to have been erected in the backyard, emitting black smoke. He had seen this red brick chimney in Guangzhou too. He knew this was a chimney for a "boiler," and a boiler was specially used to boil hot water. Speaking of hot water, reeling silk did indeed strictly need it, but there was no need to get a boiler specially to boil it, right?

Entering the front courtyard, the changes were even greater. Not only were many things added inside the courtyard, but the layout also changed. New houses and sheds were built, occupying more than half of the originally very spacious courtyard. Goods were piled up everywhere.

*What tricks are the Australians playing? Making a neat and tidy big courtyard so cramped?* Chen Lin wondered secretly.

Before he could look carefully, Chen Xuan led him into the inverted-seat rooms (Daozuofang) on the north side of the first courtyard. This was originally the accounting room of the weaving workshop. Chen Xuan's father also mostly worked and received traveling merchants here. Now, wooden signs were hung in front of each room here, and the original lattice windows were all replaced with glass windows.

*This is really particular enough.* Chen Lin muttered secretly. Second Uncle took him to one of the rooms, only to see several large Eight Immortals tables pieced together into a long table inside, with some benches placed messily on both sides. A black wooden board was also erected against the wall, with white lime remaining on it.

*What kind of style is this?* Chen Lin counted as someone who had seen quite a few "Australian Scenes," but this was the first time he saw such furnishings.

Chen Xuan greeted him to wait here for a moment. Not long after, footsteps were heard getting closer outside; it seemed quite a few people were coming. Chen Lin hurriedly straightened his clothes and cap, bowing slightly to wait quietly.

But he saw a group of people coming in from outside, led by a woman. Chen Lin was stunned.

He saw the woman was about thirty years old, looking slender and frail, wearing a blue cloth skirt and jacket, combing a double-bun hairstyle. At first glance, she was no different from local women. However, looking again, her expression and eyes were very different. Chen Lin had seen many "Real Short-hairs" from afar in Guangzhou, and recognized at a glance that this was a "Real Australian"!

Looking behind her, there was another young girl, about eighteen or nineteen years old. Her expression and appearance were quite similar to hers. Chen Lin felt greatly curious: *Unexpectedly, two Australian women came to my small Nansha Village all at once!*
