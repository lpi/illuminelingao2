# Chapter 2412: Partner

"This is my nephew, Chen Lin," Chen Xuan hurriedly bent his waist and introduced him to the Australian woman in front of him.

"Oh, I heard about him. He was originally the young owner here," the woman said casually. Chen Xuan's cheek twitched.

Chen Lin said quickly, "I can't be called the young owner. This weaving workshop is the clan's public property. The one in charge was originally my father. This small one just helped my father here."

"Your place is really strange; you open your mouth and it's 'the clan's'." The woman smiled. "Sit, sit. Everyone bending your waists and hunching your backs like braised prawns." Saying this, she sat down in front of the blackboard first on her own.

The Chen uncle and nephew also took their seats. The woman said, "Let me introduce myself first. My name is Li Yao'er, and this is my student Shen Su."

Chen Lin wanted to stand up again, but Li Yao'er waved her hand with a smile: "You, a perfectly good young man, why learn so many routines?" Her gaze circled Chen Lin a few times and asked, "How old are you?"

"This small one is falsely twenty-two years old."

"Oh, very young!" Li Yao'er said. "Your Second Uncle says you are very familiar with this line of work—how many years have you done it?"

Chen Lin said, "Ashamed to say, this small one failed in reading books and helped my father in the weaving workshop since thirteen."

"What's there to be ashamed of? The books of saints and sages you read are useless fart." Li Yao'er popped out a coarse word carelessly directly. "It's still more substantial to do work in the weaving workshop."

Chen Lin didn't count as a scholar, but hearing this woman directly criticize sage books as "fart" in front of him, he still felt a burst of awkwardness in his heart.

She changed the subject and said, "Shen Su and I are entrusted by the 'Heaven and Earth Society' under the Senate to come here to engage in silk industry improvement work. Since you are an expert, I believe our cooperation in the future will be very pleasant."

"Yes, this small one will follow your lead."

"Why are you so polite?" Li Yao'er looked at the young man in front of her. This Chen Lin was obviously different from his uncle. Although his appearance was unremarkable, he had quite some vigor. His speech and response were constrained, but intelligence could be seen between his brows. Compared to the "Second Uncle" who was full of merchant airs and always spoke with half-truths, this young man looked much more comfortable.

Li Yao'er had actually been in Guangdong for more than half a year. In these few years, she had been traveling between Lingao and Hangzhou, promoting her silkworm improvement plan, with remarkable results. A breeding station was built in Phoenix Villa in Hangzhou and another in Lingao, specialized in cultivating silkworm seeds. Because the raw silk produced by the silkworm seeds of the Hangzhou breeding station was excellent, it had already gained certain credibility among silkworm farmers around Hangzhou and gradually spread. According to the Agricultural Committee's promotion plan, the future Lingao silkworm farm would serve as a breeding research base for silkworm seeds, while the Hangzhou silkworm farm would carry out commercialized large-scale breeding, gradually eliminating the local breeds on the Hang-Jia-Hu Plain.

However, Hangzhou was not a Green Zone after all. Zhao Yingong, no matter how awesome in Hangzhou, was just a member of the gentry. There were many inconveniences and constraints.

Once the Mainland Campaign started, the Agricultural Committee turned its eyes to Guangdong.

However, before the 19th century, most exported raw silk and silk fabrics were produced in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Taking the export silk fabrics of Guangzhou as an example, the largest volume of exports was "Nanjing Silk"—that is, from the Jiangsu and Zhejiang regions; followed by satins from Sichuan, transported along the Yangtze River to the two Hu provinces, then via the Xiang River and Gan River to Guangzhou. There were also some characteristic satins from Shandong and Henan in the north transported for sale.

This meant that the Senate's export sources were all controlled by the Great Ming court. After taking Guangdong, the risk of this "transit" business increased greatly. Whether the Hangzhou Station could continue to undertake the raw silk procurement and transshipment business was also a question mark. Once the Ming court cut off trade channels and the source of silk fabrics was cut off or significantly reduced, it would inevitably affect exports—and consequently affect business reputation. This was what the Senate was least willing to see.

Expanding the sericulture and silk weaving industry in Guangdong became an imminent matter.

Guangdong has a subtropical climate, and water, heat, and light conditions are far better than in Jiangnan. Even in modern times, the Jiangnan region only raises spring and autumn silkworms, while the Pearl River Delta can raise five seasons. The basic conditions for raising silkworms and reeling silk are very good. In the old timeline, starting from the Kangxi era, Guangdong silk production increased continuously under the stimulation of foreign trade. By the late Qing Dynasty, the raw silk exported from Guangzhou was once produced entirely by the Pearl River Delta region. The satin weaving industry also had a very large scale.

However, from the intelligence data collected by Guo Yi's Guangzhou Station over the years, although there was sericulture production and silk weaving in the Pearl River Delta in this timeline, both in scale and quality, it was only a small player in the entire export silk market. Promoting new-style silk industry here had great potential.

As soon as the Pearl River Delta was pacified, under the arrangement of the Heaven and Earth Society, Li Yao'er brought her personally taught disciple Shen Su and several graduates of the Fangcaodi Sericulture Vocational Class to Guangzhou together.

During the more than one year Li Yao'er was in Hangzhou, she successively accepted more than a dozen girls as students to learn sericulture. Based on this batch of students, a Sericulture Training Institute was set up in Phoenix Villa. After she left Hangzhou, this training institute was hosted by Furong on her behalf. And she brought the two daughters of the Wang Siniang family to Lingao and sent them into the Fangcaodi Sericulture Vocational Class to study.

The two sisters Shen Hang and Shen Su made rapid progress in their studies. In addition, Li Yao'er took them with her every time she went on a business trip. Although the two sisters were young, they were already the main technical personnel of the Agricultural Committee in sericulture.

However, not long after arriving in Guangzhou, they encountered the plague and were trapped for several months in vain. Only after the plague subsided could they begin to proceed with sericulture promotion.

Li Yao'er's promotion plan was to emulate Feida Sheng's practice of establishing a promotion center in Kaixiangong Village, Wujiang, back in the day: find an area with a certain foundation in sericulture breeding and processing to set up a demonstration silkworm farm and reeling workshop, gradually promote new silkworm seeds and new technologies, and improve raw silk quality. This approach required less manpower and material resources and was relatively safe.

Where to find the "Kaixiangong" of the Senate? Li Yao'er discussed many times with Senators and naturalized citizens familiar with the local situation in Guangzhou, and finally selected Nansha Village in Xiangshan County.

Traditional Guangdong sericulture was mostly concentrated in Shunde, Dongguan, and Xiangshan. Li Yao'er went through some screening and selected Xiangshan County.

Xiangshan County had just silted up into land in the Ming Dynasty; the degree of development was still relatively low, belonging to a "Lower County." The relative population density and land prices were also low. There was large room for development. It was not far from Guangzhou and had Pearl River waterway connections, making transportation convenient. As a key governance area of Guangzhou Special Municipality, safety was guaranteed to a considerable extent.

In addition, the fact that the owner of a quite large-scale silk workshop in Nansha Village, Xiangshan County, had a "positive attitude" towards the Senate was also one of the reasons she finally chose this place.

Li Yao'er brought her promotion team and a National Army guard squad assigned to her by Bei Wei for protection to Nansha Village. When talking about "cooperation" matters with Chen Xuan, she immediately received a positive response from Chen Xuan. Li Yao'er visited Fenshenghe Weaving Workshop again and felt that the basic conditions here were not bad, and there were also many sericulture households nearby. She decided immediately to open a promotion center here.

Since the address was determined, Li Yao'er wrote a letter back to Guangzhou and immediately started managing things in Nansha. Rebuilding factory buildings, ordering equipment, busy with joy.

However, she soon discovered that this "activist" was really unreliable.

It wasn't that Chen Xuan had a "conspiracy" or "hearts towards Great Ming" or the like, but that after contacting him for a long time, she found this person actually knew nothing about sericulture and the silk industry.

The reason Li Yao'er chose to find a local partner was to understand the local traditional sericulture industry so as to make targeted improvements. As it happened, this Chen Xuan didn't know nine out of ten questions, and forced explanations for many details. After a slightly longer time, Li Yao'er's subordinates became familiar with the weavers and local villagers, and came to know that this Chen Xuan was a "local ruffian" type figure. This silk workshop wasn't his either—but was seized by him taking advantage of the chaos.

After knowing the truth, Li Yao'er was greatly disappointed. But with matters having reached this stage, she couldn't change course anymore. She could only hold her nose and continue to cooperate. Although Chen Xuan was terrible in the professional field, he was very capable in "handling affairs"; he could accomplish whatever tasks were instructed to him.

Originally, she was somewhat dreaded by such a village with strong clan power like Nansha, but Chen Xuan surprisingly "could handle it." Whether it was the clan or the village, no one dared to disobey him. This made her work in the village proceed very smoothly. He had also become one of the indispensable "talents."

Seeing the Australian woman's expression was very satisfied, Chen Xuan knew his introduction was correct. He was actually very conflicted in his heart: to curry favor with the Australians, he had to let this nephew stand out; but if the nephew gained the Australians' trust, this silk workshop would be nothing for himself. In case Chen Lin held a grudge and blew some wind in the Chief's ear again, it would be even more unimaginable.

While secretly worrying, he suddenly saw Li Yao'er's gaze drifting uncertainly on his side but not speaking, so he quickly stood up to take his leave.

Seeing Chen Xuan go out, Li Yao'er said to Chen Lin this time, "From now on, we are partners. We Australians pay attention to being straightforward in doing things. If you have any doubts or questions, you can say them to my face."

"Yes..."

Li Yao'er stopped his words: "I know, your father is the true owner of Fenshenghe. As for your Second Uncle, I understand in my heart too."

Chen Lin was so scared he quickly stood up and said, "Dare not, dare not."

"Dare not what?" Li Yao'er didn't care. "However, your Second Uncle is still a capable grassroots cadre for us. As for you uncle and nephew, you must broaden your vision and enlarge your structure. Don't stare at this small silk factory in front of you and not let go. Under the rule of the Senate, there are plenty of opportunities to build a family fortune."

Chen Lin couldn't help thinking of what his cousin-uncle told him—it seemed the Australians really intended to run workshops on a large scale! This Australian woman in front of him actually ran to such a remote hinterland to open a workshop!

If he could learn some skills of Australians running factories here, or go a step further and gain this Australian woman's favor and get her support, setting up a cotton spinning factory in Nansha later would be a matter of water flowing to form a canal!

Thinking of this, his originally somewhat dejected and forced mood brightened a lot. Immediately he said, "Since the Chief looks highly upon this small one, this small one will do the work with all his heart and strength!"
