# Chapter 2414: Xiangyunsha

The people Chen Lin usually came into contact with mostly spoke implicitly and tactfully, measuring their words and paying attention to "Doctrine of the Mean," rarely hearing such emotionally unrestrained words. He was a young man after all; Li Yao'er's words couldn't help but stir up enthusiasm in his chest. He hurriedly said, "This small one doesn't dare to say make some great career, but seeking to carry forward this family business is already enough to satisfy me."

Li Yao'er smiled without speaking; this young man was insincere. She suddenly thought of something and asked:

"Do you make Xiangyunsha here?" Li Yao'er suddenly thought of this most famous variety among Guangdong silk fabrics.

Chen Lin looked blank. Fenshenghe had naturally woven gauze, but he had unheard of the noun Xiangyunsha. He said, "Small one hasn't made it, nor heard of it."

Li Yao'er thought for a moment and asked again, "It's the gauze dyed with *Shuliang* (Dye Yam)."

"*Shuliang*? That's *Liangchou* (Gambiered Silk)," Chen Lin nodded. "Have, have."

"Any finished products?"

"There were some originally, only after the soldier disaster, the stock is probably gone..."

Li Yao'er showed a look of disappointment. Xiangyunsha was a fist product among traditional Guangdong silk fabrics. It was popular for a time in the 1930s and 40s of the old timeline. It was crisp and smooth, had good fastness to sunlight and washing, strong waterproofness, easy to wash and dry, dark in color and dirt-resistant, didn't stick to the skin, light and thin and not easy to wrinkle, soft and full of body, durable, and suitable for wearing in hot summer, welcomed by consumers. It was not only widely praised in the domestic market but also exported in large quantities to foreign countries, especially Southeast Asia.

According to the data Li Yao'er saw, Xiangyunsha was a satin variety that only formally appeared in the Republic of China era. But such a variety obviously didn't appear out of thin air. She later checked some materials and found that there were similar production processes in the Ming Dynasty, and also records of export.

If this kind of satin could be improved and mass-produced, it would be a fist product for local satin export.

虽然 records existed, Li Yao'er hadn't seen real Xiangyunsha yet. Asking Chen Xuan was also asking three times without knowing one.

"Although there is no stock, my sister still has a *Liangchou* small shirt. If the Chief wants to see it, I will fetch it."

"Good, go fetch it."

Chen Lin quickly called Chen Qing over and asked him to go back and ask his sister for a *Liangchou* small shirt.

In just a moment, Chen Qing delivered a cloth bundle. Chen Lin opened it to look; it was exactly a close-fitting small shirt of Chen Yue.

This was a sister's close-fitting item; holding it in hand was somewhat awkward, so he presented the cloth bundle.

Li Yao'er took the material in hand, looked carefully, and rubbed it again. She said, "This isn't *Sha* (Gauze)..."

"This is *Liangchou*."

Chen Lin wasn't wrong; this was indeed a piece of *Liangchou*. The material was dyed brownish-yellow, and the fabric itself was plain woven silk. It felt soft and smooth to the touch, but the hand feel was quite thick. Looking closely, whether silkworm silk texture, dyeing work, or hand feel, all were relatively poor. Far inferior to other silks she had seen.

"This is woven from local silk, right?"

"Chief has good eyesight." Chen Lin said, "This was woven by Fenshenghe. The dyeing was also done by ourselves..."

"You know how to dye?"

"Chief is joking. This *Shuliang* dyeing isn't some secret; it's most common." Chen Lin was somewhat strange. Various colorants needed for satin dyeing, except for indigo which was planted in large quantities locally, were either produced in other places or simply came from Nanyang, mostly costing a lot. Only this *Shuliang* was planted in large areas locally and wasn't valuable itself. Besides *Liangchou*, *Liangbu* (Gambiered Cloth) was also very common.

"Hasn't been coated with mud?"

"Coated with mud?" Chen Lin was baffled now. "Why coat with mud? Wouldn't coating with mud get it dirty?"

Li Yao'er knew now that there was only *Liangchou* at this time, and no later Xiangyunsha process.

According to the standard of the old timeline, Xiangyunsha actually referred to a traditional process. Broadly speaking, fabrics using mulberry silk fabric as the base embryo cloth and undergoing a mineral coating process were all called Xiangyunsha.

In the textile market of the old timeline, because there were many kinds of Xiangyunsha, everyone had their own preferences. For the same Xiangyunsha fabric, different types of Xiangyunsha were thin or thick, soft or hard, varying greatly.

In terms of market price, from low to high, they were Crepe De Chine Xiangyunsha, Pearl Satin Xiangyunsha, Turtle Crack Pattern Xiangyunsha, and Guanle Crepe Xiangyunsha.

These were the common types. Traditional Xiangyunsha was plain gauze without printing. Modern Xiangyunsha had patterns and prints according to different varieties, which would affect the specific price. Generally speaking, those with prints were mostly *Liangchou* types. Crepe De Chine Xiangyunsha and Pearl Satin Xiangyunsha were the most numerous; they felt soft and belonged to satin fabrics.

Solid color Xiangyunsha were mostly *Liangsha* (Gambiered Gauze) types. They felt relatively harder and had better breathability. In ancient times, there was a saying that women wore *Liangchou* and men wore *Sha*. Generally, Guanle Crepe Xiangyunsha and Turtle Crack Pattern Xiangyunsha belonged to the *Liangsha* type. Traditional Xiangyunsha basically referred to this type.

Strictly speaking, Xiangyunsha must use *Sha* as the base embryo cloth, dyed with *Shuliang* juice, then coated with river mud from the Shunde area, and then aired and dried.

Obviously, this *Liangchou* could only count as generalized Xiangyunsha. Judging from its hand feel and texture, it inevitably wasn't high-grade goods either.

"Haven't you tried dyeing with *Sha*?"

"*Sha*?" Chen Lin was stunned, then suddenly understood. "Chief means *Luo* (Gauze/Luo silk), right?"

"Right, just *Luo*." Li Yao'er's face felt somewhat hot. Because *Sha* wasn't a strict satin category; it was mostly used to refer to light, thin, and transparent textiles. In satin classification, it mostly referred to *Luo*. *Luo*'s texture is light and thin, silk threads are fine, and warp threads are twisted with each other to form pepper-hole shapes. The texture is tight and solid, the gauze holes ventilate and let cool air through, comfortable to wear and cool. Specially suitable for making summer clothing.

"We have done dyeing *Luo* with *Shuliang*, and there are sales, just not too many."

"Why not many?"

"*Luo* and Satin are for rich people to wear. Common people can't afford them! How many people can afford to wear them!" Chen Lin said, "Small one heard that in the first-class rich places of Jiangnan like Suzhou and Hangzhou, even peddlers and servants wear silk and satin; don't know if it's true or false. Just speaking of Guangzhou Prefecture alone, there really aren't many sales."

"I don't know if peddlers and servants in Suzhou and Hangzhou wear silk and satin, but this Xiangyunsha is a boon for summer. If it can be made in batches, whether domestic or export, there will be a big market."

"But satin costs a lot..."

"So we have to beat down the cost of raising silkworms. With more silk, satin will be cheaper. And this workshop, weaving is truly too slow... Your uncle said only a few hundred bolts of silk material can be woven here in a whole year—this is too few. Weaving tens of thousands of bolts a year, the price will definitely come down."

Chen Lin was confused: "If the price comes down, wouldn't the profit earned be less..."

Li Yao'er said: "You don't know how to calculate! It doesn't matter if the profit earned per item is small. If you earn one tael of silver per bolt of silk and sell one hundred bolts a year, you only earn one hundred taels; if I can sell ten thousand bolts a year and earn one mace (0.1 tael) per bolt, I earn one thousand taels. Only if everyone can come to wear it can Fenshenghe earn big money!"

Chen Lin still couldn't turn the corner, but he knew it was better for him to disobey Australian decisions less. He agreed repeatedly.

"Let's go look in the factory," Li Yao'er said.

"Yes."

"This Fenshenghe was originally your family's property; presumably, you are familiar with every blade of grass and tree, every brick and tile."

"Small one helped Father manage the property in the workshop since ten-plus years old."

"But the current Fenshenghe is different from the past," Li Yao'er said. "Given time, it will change even more greatly."

Chen Lin said yes and yes. He thought reeling silk and weaving satin had been the same since ancient times; could it be Australians could weave out of thin air without using silkworm silk? Quite a few Australian goods had appeared on the market these years, but he had never heard of Australian Satin or Australian Cloth.

"This row of inverted-seat rooms was originally Fenshenghe's accounting room. We also follow Cao's rules (follow established rules) and set up the Management Office here. Although the calling is different, the meaning is the same." Li Yao'er strolled on the walkway. "The front courtyard is mainly for external communication. I intend to set up a warehouse to collect cocoons here after spring begins. These houses are prepared for this."

Chen Lin's dad had also thought about the matter of setting up a warehouse to collect cocoons himself, and even once thought about expanding his own reeling room to use all his own silk and not external silk.

Reeling silk oneself without using external silk could firstly guarantee the quality of raw silk. Purchasing raw silk relied entirely on the eyesight and integrity of the silk accountant. Without a capable and trustworthy silk accountant general, the quality of collected raw silk depended entirely on luck; with worse luck, even the weight wouldn't be enough.

However, things were not that simple. Chen Lin said: "Chief, doing silk oneself naturally has many benefits, but there are also difficulties within."

"Presumably there are people taking the opportunity to instigate silkworm farmers?"

"Chief predicts things like a god." Chen Lin nodded. "If we can achieve high prices for high quality, collecting silk is a good thing convenient for both host and guest. It's just that there are many entanglements within, and people fishing for profit from it are also not few. Ignorant commoners are often easily bewitched by people..."

"I know this. But I see there are still reeling rooms in your factory."

"Yes, my family is a big clan locally. In Nansha locally, with the clan backing, my father could still handle it. But silkworm farmers from outside villages, that couldn't be leveled. So Fenshenghe collects both silk and cocoons."

Li Yao'er said: "You don't need to worry about this. An important article in my sericulture improvement is factory reeling, no longer making local silk. I will test the waters first this year. If smooth, next year I will implement it to the whole county..."

Chen Lin clicked his tongue secretly, thinking *worthy of being Australians, the tone is so big!* He didn't know how they intended to persuade silkworm farmers—the most obvious thing was that the selling price of silkworm cocoons was not as good as raw silk. As long as the silkworm farmer's family wasn't short of labor, they would all choose to reel into silk before selling. Could they put a knife on the neck to force silkworm farmers not to make silk and sell cocoons?

"...Besides purchasing dried cocoons, I also prepare to sell silkworm seeds here. The first batch of silkworm seeds will be shipped from Lingao very soon. These storehouses will temporarily serve as silkworm seed warehouses." Li Yao'er said and asked again, "How do the silkworm farmers here get their silkworm seeds?"
