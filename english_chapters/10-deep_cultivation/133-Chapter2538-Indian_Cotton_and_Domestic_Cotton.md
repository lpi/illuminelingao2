# Chapter 2538: Indian Cotton and Domestic Cotton

In the Textile Industrial Park of Nanbao, most workshops in the formerly lively cotton textile factory were now quiet. The noise of the past was no more.

If you went in, you would find that many workshops were empty. Equipment had flown away without wings, leaving only the bases. The equipment had all been dismantled weeks ago and sent to the General Machinery Plant in Lingao for comprehensive overhaul and refurbishment, ready to be shipped to Guangdong.

Some new equipment had arrived successively and began installation and trial operation.

Li Shan was very concerned about the new equipment because this set of new equipment was "designed" according to the process flow he came up with. The specific implementation was by Zou Biao.

Several months ago, after determining to carry out "capacity diffusion" in Guangdong and preparing to sell all the old equipment of the Demonstration Factory, Li Shan took out a demand plan for spinning machinery to Zou Biao.

However, after邹 Biao looked at it, he raised doubts: "The equipment is not difficult; current machinery plants can all manufacture it. But there is a tiny problem inside. The Model 54 spinning frame is an all-electric model with a rotation speed of 12,000 r/min, while we can only make things of 4,500 r/min. Perhaps it cannot reach the output of 15 kg per hour."

"You are talking about the spindle speed of the ring spinning frame. Model 54 refers not just to the machine; it is a whole set of process flow. I don't know about other industries, but in the textile industry, process flow and shaft rotation speed have no absolute relationship. Moreover, many processes are not mandatory, although they will affect output and quality. Using Model 54 process and us making the ring spinning frame within Model 54 are two different things. Why, in the Model 54 process, scutching is changed from two passes to single pass, and drawing is changed from three passes to two passes? These processes have no direct relationship with rotation speed, yet they can greatly save time and increase output. I think you know this too, right?"

Actually, it was equivalent to allocating things previously done by machines in peripheral procedures to people. Although social productivity decreased, the output of the machine alone increased. However, for an agricultural society that originally had no machines, it had already skyrocketed.

"I know this, but spindle speed has a great influence on output. I'm just giving you a vaccination [warning]; perhaps the finished product cannot meet expectations." Zou Biao said.

It was now the second week of the Model 25 Ring Spinning Machine's operation. Li Shan and Zou Biao observed the production situation of the new-style machine inside the textile factory. Today, Cheng Milian also came to visit.

The Model 25 Ring Spinning was manufactured with reference to the Model 54 process flow, driven by steam power. The output per thousand spindles per hour was roughly around 13-15 kg.

"It seems actual production cannot consistently reach the output of 15 kg." Zou Biao concluded through the production record sheet. The actual stable production efficiency was about 13 kg.

Overall, it was much better than he estimated. Model 54 was an early domestic spinning machine in the old timeline. Although Li Shan's demand was based on Model 54, it did not follow Model 54 completely; there was also some content from the Model 65 process flow.

"Although spindle rotation speed is a factor affecting output, it is not the only factor. For example, roller speed, package size, yarn count, etc., will all affect output. Output is not determined merely by a spindle rotation speed." Li Shan said.

"Is our product different from the Model 54 process?" Cheng Milian asked.

"Although spindle speed is not the only factor, if the rotation speed is low, output and quality are still much worse. The standard Model 54 spinning machine in the old timeline produced 25 kg per thousand spindles per hour for 20 English count yarn, while we produce 14 English count and barely manage 15 kg per thousand spindles per hour." Zou Biao said after putting the record back.

"English count?"

"A unit of measurement from the British fellows; explaining it is very complicated. You just need to know that in international cotton textile trading, the higher the count, the higher the cost, and the finer the yarn. The count of top-grade Songjiang cloth is around 14S-16S, while the coarser the yarn, the greater the output." Li Shan pulled out a roll of finished product to observe before his eyes. Honestly, in the old timeline, this was generally used to make jeans, and the rougher kind at that.

The higher the count, the finer the yarn, which also meant the yarn was more expensive. However, under current circumstances, the greatest demand was for low-count yarn: such as canvas (which is denim), fireproof cloth, cloth for labor protection suits, etc. The higher the count of cotton products, the more delicate and precious they were, generally used for knitted underwear, high-grade clothing, or high-end bedding. Some counts reached as high as 80S. But in this era, cotton products generally wouldn't be made so high because limited by manual craftsmanship, single ply topped out at 16S. Striving for high-count fabric generally meant using silk products rather than cotton products.

"Since there is English Count, is there also Metric Count?" Cheng Milian asked. Length had inches, feet, miles, and corresponding metric units like kilometers, so naturally, people would wonder if there was a Metric Count.

"Of course there is, but it's generally used on wool and silk textiles. I'm used to it; the cotton textile industry in the old timeline was greatly influenced by Britain, and everyone used it that way. Converting it, 14 English Count is about 20 Metric Count. The standard Model 54 is around 33 Metric Count, much finer than ours."

"Won't we unify using Metric Count in the future?" Cheng Milian thought of the vigorous standardization initiative in the industrial sector before, requiring the removal of all baffling industry standards from the old timeline—especially the Imperial system.

"Too troublesome. Isn't it just a title? The symbol for English Count is S; can't we just say it's the abbreviation for Song Count? It's best not to move standards. Look, the industrial sector still has quite a few standard parts in Imperial system—once the influence of this thing is formed, it's not something you can avoid just by changing a timeline."

"Like that bizarre 1435 standard gauge." Zou Biao laughed.

"Correct. Once a standard is formed, modifying it isn't that simple." Li Shan didn't want to change the English system partly because of this factor; too many technical materials and industry standards were formulated according to the Imperial system of the old timeline.

"However, the Planning Academy seems to have doubts about the cotton yarn production line with a daily output of eight tons. Now they only approved this two-ton production line." Zou Biao said. The previous proposal was to build multiple production lines with a daily output of eight tons in the Demonstration Factory, requiring about twenty-five thousand spindles. But the Planning Academy was very hesitant about developing cotton textiles.

"What the Planning Academy fears is nothing more than raw material and market problems. The cotton textile industry was cancelled like this during the First Five-Year Plan period." Li Shan said.

"Yes. If twenty-five thousand spindles produce at full capacity under ideal conditions, it requires consuming 1,200 tons of cotton annually. Hainan itself produces almost no usable industrial cotton. Leaving aside whether we can collect that much cotton from outside, if we exclude the internal circulation of the Senate-controlled areas, at least 400 tons of products need to be sold externally." Zou Biao said.

400 tons of cotton products were enough for two hundred thousand well-off people to use for a year. However, this was also maximized production under ideal conditions. Actually, twenty-five thousand spindles wouldn't consume that much cotton annually.

"I know what they are worried about. If we say we avoid large-scale development of the weaving industry, I agree. But avoiding the development of spinning is a very unreasonable situation."

"Under the tax system of the Ming Dynasty, regardless of whether it is backward or not, about sixty percent of households in Hainan own manual looms. This is a fairly high proportion. The characteristics of textile determine that most of the time the loom is waiting for yarn; the vacancy rate is quite high."

"Weaving a bolt of cloth takes an average of seven days. Among them, spinning accounts for four to five days, and weaving only takes one day. For the remaining six days, the loom is almost vacant. If we sell yarn, we can fill this vacancy." Li Shan said.

In the old timeline, the so-called "native cloth resisting foreign cloth" of the Great Qing was actually not accurate. Before the Opium War, Guangdong native cloth already contained a large amount of foreign yarn. The vigorous development of manual native cloth actually relied on the import of foreign yarn. But this process was quite complicated and could not be summarized in one sentence.

"What about the raw material part?" Cheng Milian asked.

"Judging from historical statistics, Songjiang alone sells 13 million bolts of cotton cloth annually, roughly having more than ten thousand tons of cotton every year. And at this time, there is still a lot of commodity cotton from the north flowing in. However, considering the disaster situation in the north, perhaps our cotton needs to be obtained in India."

"The problem is, how do we make them not weave cloth locally but ship cotton to us? Previously we also purchased a lot of Indian cloth." Zou Biao said. This wasn't just his question. Historically, Indian cloth was famous. If Europeans were willing to purchase Indian cloth, they would process it locally rather than shipping cotton over.

"Cough! Mo Xiaoan might have taken bribes from Quark Qiong [possible transliteration for a character name or reference], but I have no evidence." Li Shan jokingly said, "According to the figures in the *Trade Yearbook* of the Ministry of Colonial Trade, the FOB average price of the Indian cotton cloth we purchased is about 2 yuan per bolt, while the FOB average price of Songjiang cloth is much cheaper, only 0.5 yuan. Of course, the Songjiang cloth we import is inferior to Indian cotton cloth in quality."

"Ssi! Then didn't the Senate spend a lot of extra money before?" Cheng Milian was quite surprised. He heard that schools used Indian cloth. So many students over so many years—how much money was that!

"That's not necessarily true. Looking at the imported cotton cloth figures over the years, we imported large quantities of both Songjiang cloth and Indian cloth. The import proportion of low-end undyed Songjiang cloth is the highest among all textiles. It can only be explained that application scenarios are different, and each has a different market."

"But high FOB price of Indian cloth doesn't it also mean high FOB price of cotton?" Zou Biao asked. "If we want to import Indian cotton, high price means we certainly can't compete with local cotton. In that case, our cotton import can only be mainly domestic."

"In normal years, perhaps Indian cotton is really not cheaper than domestic cotton. But now with war in the north, farmers probably find it hard to plant cotton with peace of mind. Whether the original cotton producing areas in the Central Plains and Huang-Huai region can be counted on is a question mark. So the domestic raw cotton price will inevitably rise. We may not lose by importing Indian cotton. Even if we lose a bit, it's no problem. As long as we can import raw materials, with our production efficiency, we will quickly compress costs to the minimum. At that time, we will dump into India again, easily crushing its local manual cotton textile industry. Then we can suppress the cotton price."
