# Chapter 2744: The Capital (Part 96)

The capital's most exquisite cuisine wasn't found in restaurants. Besides the imperial kitchen and the private chefs of officials and nobles, the finest banquets were held in the pleasure quarters.

In a hall in the capital's finest pleasure house, crimson candles burned high while Xiang curtains hung low. Outside, the wind was biting cold; inside, four white copper braziers blazed, making the room warm as spring. Three eight-immortals tables were set up, each with eight tall displays of candied dried fruits, decorated with auspicious phrases like fortune, prosperity, longevity, and happiness. In the center stood a foot-high sugar sculpture of the Lion Immortal. Against the walls, large porcelain plates held tall piles of Buddha's-hand citrons from the south. More than ten pots of Zhangzhou narcissus flowers bloomed fragrantly. The air was filled with a refined, elegant scent.

Today was the capital banking guild's first New Year banquet. The guild's fifteen establishments, large and small, would gather here to feast and discuss the coming year's business.

It was just past noon. Only the "major peers" were here for discussion. According to the guild's unwritten rules, "minor peers" wouldn't arrive until nightfall. Important matters would be decided by the major peers in the afternoon; by evening, they would merely be informed. Naturally, minor peers' interests wouldn't be considered, hence their frustrations—yet they were helpless.

The major peers were uniformly "Shanxi Houses." At that time, Shanxi Houses hadn't yet evolved into the purely commercial financial institutions of later banks, but were trade-cum-finance enterprises doing everything. As the name suggested, Shanxi Houses were shops run by Shanxi merchants in the capital. They mainly dealt in "Shanxi goods" and "Mongol goods," including common agricultural products and daily necessities, as well as government-monopolized or controlled goods like salt, tea, and horses. Money exchange was merely a sideline to these businesses.

However, Shanxi merchants had long recognized the enormous profits in money exchange, deposits, and lending. Given their massive operating capital and high liquidity, they needed financial industry support. Thus Shanxi Houses had gradually, without formal training, developed a financial business—which eventually became their primary operation.

Today's most important agenda item was naturally how to deal with Delong and its aftermath.

The capital banking guild's chairman was surnamed Cao. Though Shanxi merchants were famous throughout the realm, in the money trade, their financiers, managers, and clerks almost all came from a dozen or so counties in central Shanxi. Chairman Cao was no exception—originally from Taigu. He'd started as a bank clerk, worked in the capital for over thirty years, and risen to the position of manager.

Though just a manager, his power was immense—practically half an owner within the bank. He controlled operations, personnel, and finances, answering only to the owner. The compensation was generous, plus he had dry shares for dividends. A white-collar position indeed.

But the owner demanded high returns. After three years, when accounts were settled, if profits satisfied the owner, a single dividend could earn what ordinary people made in several lifetimes. But if profits were poor or there were losses, no one would hire him again.

Thus anyone who'd reached manager position and maintained it for decades was an old fox. And whoever served as guild chairman was a fox spirit cultivated to perfection.

Manager Cao's Shanxi House was simply called "Chang's"—a characteristic of these houses: no fancy names, just the owner's surname. Among the eight Shanxi shops in the capital, it ranked only fifth or sixth. This was their kind of balance—avoiding any one house becoming dominant. So the chairman was never from the top three houses.

Shanxi Houses had operated in the capital for over a century—complete local serpents. When Delong first arrived, though it had connections and face, it took considerable effort to establish itself. During that time, they'd jointly tripped up Delong, only stopping short of force because Delong had palace connections.

Later, when Delong grew strong through wire transfers and Zishi Fine Products, circumstances no longer allowed backstabbing. They began normal courteous relations with Delong. Despite Delong's growth, it was still far inferior to the strength and deposit scale behind Shanxi Houses. Strictly speaking, Delong was still a "minor peer."

Originally, Leng Ningyun had no intention of challenging the capital's financial order or escalating conflict. But once he had wire transfers as a secret weapon, the long-distance remittance business—especially the lucrative Jiangnan and Guangdong remittances—basically excluded Shanxi Houses. Moreover, with telegraphs as his secret weapon, Delong knew the money supply situation everywhere, could dispatch funds as if with arm and finger, and always earned generous profits. This made the Shanxi House peers both envious and resentful.

When the Short-Hairs invaded and Guangdong fell, Shanxi Houses were excited for a while, thinking Delong would soon perish. Unexpectedly, Delong quietly muddled through. The forces behind it truly astonished the merchants. So things had been calm during this period.

Before year's end, hearing that Leng Ningyun had been kidnapped by bandits made the Shanxi House managers celebrate again. In these times, being kidnapped meant even if you survived, Delong would be severely damaged. The very day they heard the news, several managers conspired to spread rumors and run on the bank, taking down Delong in one stroke.

Unexpectedly, subsequent developments were dizzying. Not only was Delong sealed to prevent a run and collapse, but before the New Year, Leng Ningyun miraculously returned.

"Whether Leng Ningyun returns doesn't matter. Delong is badly hurt now—probably just going to close up shop." Qiao Wannian, the leading manager of Qiao's, said with a smile while sniffing Western snuff.

"Manager Qiao, you're really out of touch!" Manager Qin Shengyu of He's sneered. "Word from Shuntian Prefecture is that Lord Zhong will unseal Delong the moment he returns to office on the fourth. If they wanted to close, why unseal? Unsealing means they're reopening!"

"Not necessarily reopening." Manager Yuan of Shen's was the youngest among the eight managers, only in his early forties. "Without unsealing, he can't access the silver or ledgers in the vault. You can't just walk away empty-handed. The bank has at least tens of thousands of taels."

"My dear Yuan, you really are a naive commoner." Manager Shen of Xia's, lounging on a Xiang-concubine daybed openly smoking, sneered. "This Leng Ningyun isn't a good person—he's probably a Short-Hair himself. If he wants to flee, what does an imperial seal matter to him? Just waste paper."

"Right, if it's just waste paper to him, why ask the Prefect to unseal? Just run."

Manager Shen was momentarily stunned, looking embarrassed. "Just some final struggle."

Manager Shen was the most determined among the Shanxi House managers that Delong was finished and Leng Ningyun would flee. Everyone knew his eagerness to disparage Delong was probably because Xia's was deeply implicated in this affair.

Though all managers thoroughly disliked Delong and hoped this Short-Hair-connected aberration would disappear from the capital soon, the capital's complex environment had taught them not to express opinions easily.

"I think Delong will definitely reopen." Manager Cao said. "Yesterday, Wu Kaidi visited all six minor peers—probably seeking short-term loans to prepare for emergency when they reopen."

"How dare they!" Manager Shen's eyes went round. "These barbarians don't want to eat this bowl of rice in the capital anymore?!"

"Whether they dare doesn't matter." Manager Qin looked disdainful. "These few houses each have only thirty or forty thousand taels capital—the largest has only sixty thousand. How much can they scrape together for Delong? Let's stick with our plan: the moment Delong dares open, we crush them in one blow!"

"Crushing Delong is easy, but who cleans up the mess?" Liu Shuheng, the chief manager of Wang's, who'd been silent, finally spoke. Wang's was the largest Shanxi House, with the strongest resources. Reportedly, its available funds exceeded a million, with capital of thirty to forty thousand.

"The notes Delong has out there are probably at least two hundred thousand." Manager Yuan calculated. "They have at most a hundred thousand in reserves. Once we run on them, they'll definitely collapse. After they collapse, the capital's market will look very ugly."

"So what if they collapse? Just a few more people jumping into wells and hanging themselves." Manager Shen was dismissive.

"But we ourselves won't escape unscathed." Manager Yuan said. "It's different now. Before, their notes were few and we had little dealings with them. These past few years, dealings have surged. Which of us doesn't hold Delong notes? When Delong collapses, won't these notes become waste paper?"

Manager Shen sneered. "Look at you—hesitating over just a few thousand taels. Can you do big business worrying about that? Once Delong's gone, won't all their depositors be ours?"

Manager Yuan said coldly. "Manager Shen! Our small shop has limited resources, unlike your wealthy Xia family! A net loss of several thousand taels—can that be brushed off with 'doing big business' when settling accounts?"

His words raised a thousand-foot wave, for each house held considerable Delong notes—some over ten thousand, the least several thousand.

"If these Delong notes could be fully redeemed before they collapsed, that'd be fine. If not, there's no way to explain it!"

"How do we manage to redeem our notes AND crush Delong?"

...

The managers were all whispering. Except for Manager Qin, the talk showed little enthusiasm for the run.

Manager Shen grew anxious. How had the wind suddenly shifted? Watching the managers still putting on airs, he sneered: "Gentlemen, stop pretending! Who doesn't know that after Leng Ningyun was kidnapped last month, each of you bought up Delong notes at twenty or thirty percent of face value, preparing for the run. Now that Delong's about to reopen, you're all getting cold feet?"

"Manager Shen, please calm down." Manager Cao spoke up to smooth things over. "We naturally can't tolerate Delong Bank. But as for how specifically to proceed, everyone should discuss first."
