# Chapter 2688: The Capital (Part 40)

However, the Shorn-hair Thieves invading, occupying Lingao, defeating the government army, besieging Guangzhou... he knew nothing of these major events. Was he still an Australian?!

This was truly strange...

Master Wang's thoughts hadn't finished turning when he heard him say again:

"Oh, that Viceroy Wang won't live for a few months, and then it should be the Lord taking over." Mr. Zhou took out a cipher book to check. "Right, correct, taking office next year."

"Oh, previously the Teacher seemed to mention it, but this matter has major implications; this Official needs to plan at length." Wang Yehao couldn't digest it for a moment. He had to choose to change the topic. "Yourong has been here these days; don't know if she suits the Teacher's heart?"

"Not bad, not bad." Mr. Zhou nodded repeatedly, revealing a lecherous smile.

*Top-grade thin horses you don't like, but a kitchen maid you enjoy like candy!* Master Wang felt disdain secretly. But this was also good; at least it saved him money.

"Don't know if there is an omen of dreaming of bears?"

"Dreaming of bears?"

Zhou Lezhi hurriedly whispered: "Master Wang is asking if there is a sign of pregnancy."

"Oh, oh," Mr. Zhou shook his head with a face full of loneliness and helplessness. "No."

"Why not invite a doctor to look..."

Mr. Zhou's complexion immediately became very bad; obviously, he was very dissatisfied with someone questioning his ability in this aspect.

Master Wang was an old fox in officialdom; what he was best at was observing words and expressions. Seeing this, he already understood, secretly thinking that although this Hearthstone Immortal was lecherous, heirs were difficult to come by. It seemed he still had to use the old method of Zhou Juli to restrain him.

"This Official just obtained a supreme Korean ginseng last month; I'll let Wang Liang send it over tomorrow. Perhaps it can offer some benefit."

"Many thanks, many thanks. Hope it will have effect."

In order to change the topic, Master Wang brought up the construction project on the Dongyang Farm.

After buying the Dongyang Farm, Master Wang had also consulted Hearthstone Immortal about "construction projects." Mr. Zhou was originally not very interested in this matter, but he suddenly changed his mind after seeing the "Farm Panoramic Map" from Dongyang. Not long ago, he proposed using the abundant mountain water sources in the mountain villa to build a water mill. At this moment, he brought it up again.

"Trip-hammer houses have existed since ancient times; using them to hull rice is excellent. It's just that this farm doesn't have much land; how much paddy can there be?" Wang Yehao disapproved. In terms of the farm's land, rather than spending money to build a water trip-hammer house, it was better to hull rice manually. If speaking of processing for customers, Dongyang was mostly mountainous; fields were few and scattered, and paddy yield was not much. It wasn't worth transporting specially for processing.

"Besides paddy, a water-powered trip-hammer house can grind many things." Mr. Zhou had a card up his sleeve [was confident]. "For example, incense."

Traditionally, making various incenses involved crushing and mixing various plants or minerals containing fragrances. If no binder was added, it was loose incense; adding binder made stick incense or rod incense. Technically, there was nothing mysterious.

"This stuff is everywhere in Dongyang; can't sell for much money." Wang Yehao said, "It's just that Zhejiang Province has no precious spices—good spices all come from Nanyang or the Western Oceans. Transporting them specifically to Dongyang to make incense has no profit margin."

Locally in Dongyang, plants that could be called spices were only limited to camphor wood and cypress wood. Cheap stick incense made from them had long filled the market; for the Wang family to stick a foot in would at most earn some small money.

"I know this. I am also the Lord's fellow townsman." Mr. Zhou appeared confident. "Dongyang doesn't have other spices, but there is always *Qinghao* [Sweet Wormwood], right?"

"*Qinghao* is everywhere, but it is used for smoking away mosquitoes and insects in summer." Wang Yehao shook his head subconsciously. "There are indeed those who use it as mosquito incense, only it's too smoky."

This stuff was indeed effective in driving away mosquitoes and insects, but currently, people used *Qinghao* sticks—bundles of *Qinghao* dried and rolled into stick incense with local paper, ignited to drive mosquitoes. Rolling thick smoke; true the mosquitoes were driven away, but people also couldn't stand the smoke. If lit indoors, doors and windows must be open for ventilation.

"That is because the incense-making method is wrong." Following this, Hearthstone Immortal took out a folded paper from his body. "You ask the farm to make it according to my formula and process; the smoke will be much smaller."

Wang Yehao didn't take it seriously either. Looking at the raw materials above, there were no precious things; all could be bought cheaply locally in Dongyang. If this Hearthstone Immortal wanted to play with something fresh, it didn't matter. What the mountains lacked least were waterfalls; building a trip-hammer house wouldn't cost much money.

"Since so, I will tell people to build one."

"Ai ai ai, I also have a secret method for this trip-hammer house, nonexistent in the Central Plains. If there is time, I still want to go to the farm personally to guide construction."

A trace of doubt flashed past Master Wang's eyes, seemingly suspecting his motive. Zhou Lezhi was secretly worried, only hearing the Teacher say again: "I myself also saved some silver. If the money for reconstruction isn't enough, I can also take money out to buy shares!"

Zhou Lezhi laughed secretly; the Teacher really had no ability to see the situation. was this a problem of money?!

Unexpectedly, Master Wang nodded: "It is good that the Teacher has this heart. However, a mere farm is not enough to ask the Teacher to take money out for operation and growth." He thought for a moment; anyway, arriving in Dongyang was still within his control. Moreover, the general situation was set now; going to Liangguang would have to wait until next year. Keeping him for these more than half a year was useless too; better to let him go toss about and see what intention exactly he harbored! Immediately he said: "Since so, in a few days this student will send people to escort the Teacher to Dongyang."

"Good, good," Mr. Zhou danced with eyebrows [was radiant with joy]. "Dongyang is a good place."

"Night is already deep; Teacher please rest the night in this study."

After sending away Master Wang, Zhou Lezhi helped the Master make the bed and pour water, serving the Master to wash up. Unexpectedly, Hearthstone Immortal had no intention of sleeping. He sat on the bed, eyes burning, expression complex.

Zhou Lezhi worried secretly: *Does the Teacher have any plan?*

Regarding going to Dongyang, he never mentioned it to him, but he knew the Teacher detested the local climate. The climate here was completely different from the South; when not raining, wind and sand filled the sky; once raining, stinking mud filled the ground. Not to mention the Master, even Zhou Lezhi was very unaccustomed to it. When hearing Master Wang might go to assume office in Guangzhou, he had cheered a little in his heart for a while.

However, suddenly proposing to go to the Dongyang farm to build some water trip-hammer, what did that mean? Could it be the Immortal wanted to run away? Naturally, the Shorn-hair Thieves making noise in Qiongzhou Prefecture now were the Immortal's "fellow townsmen." The Teacher missed his hometown eagerly; running away home was also a normal thing.

It was just, in case the Teacher wanted to run, should he run or not?

Serving the Teacher in Master Wang's residence these two years, not only were clothes and food worry-free, but he also learned a lot of learning with the Teacher, useful or useless unknown. If the Teacher ran, naturally he was going back to Australia; he himself definitely couldn't follow. But if he didn't run, let alone whether Master Wang would deal with him, even if magnanimous, he would be a useless person, only able to roll up his bedding and get out.

Although the clan had a mouthful of rice for him to eat, that was just not starving to death. How could it compare to eating fragrant and drinking spicy now, and being able to tease maids and aunties...

Used not a few minutes, Zhou Lezhi made up his mind: must not let the Master run away!

Just thinking, suddenly the Teacher called him over. Zhou Lezhi shook, fearing the Master peeped his mindset, and walked over hurriedly.

"You look; what is this pile of Australian trash?"

Zhou Lezhi had already seen these things just now. Except for a few shattered glass pieces he could guess were some kind of glass vessels, he had no way to understand other various trash. Instead, he understood somewhat that pile of metal pipes and castings on the ground.

"These things on the table, this student cannot make out. As for the things on the ground, they seem to be boiler accessories—Master Wang also said just now, this is the machine activated by water and fire power in *Ziminglou*."

"You are very right, but still lacking one point." Mr. Zhou kicked these copper and iron trash. "This is a spray head, used for bathing..."

"Lotus head."

"Correct, in Australia many people call it that," Mr. Zhou said. "This row of copper pipes is actually a heat exchanger—what a heat exchanger is, I told you."

"Yes, this student remembers."

"En, what about this?"

"It is a valve. Used on water pipes."

"En, you haven't forgotten yet." Mr. Zhou sighed as he spoke. "Pity, this set of things was made quite exquisitely, but was smashed by someone. However, they are really amazing, actually able to make so many things..."

Zhou Lezhi dared not interrupt, only watching from the side as the Teacher rummaged through the garbage on the table with great interest. While muttering to himself:

"Grass! Isn't this a bandage? medical waste also collected!" "Good heavens, safety helmet also made! Why not wear steel helmets when fighting?" ... "Sulfonamide?!"

Mr. Zhou screamed suddenly, holding a small tube in his hand.

The tube looked like it was made by cutting fine bamboo, covered with a layer of raw lacquer on the outside. The seal used wax, already broken. There were small black characters written on the bamboo tube.

It seemed this thing gave the Teacher a very huge shock.

"Actually can make Sulfonamide!" The Teacher frowned tightly. "Unthinkable, unthinkable..."

When lecturing on medicine, the Teacher had said: Sulfonamide is a most basic antibiotic, which can be used to deal with lower-level infections.

"Teacher, this medicine should not compare to the medicine in your gourd..."

"Correct, difference is very far." Unknown why, a bitter smile appeared on the Teacher's face. "However, a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Having this is incredible." Saying so, his expression became excited again. "Amazing, amazing..."

Saying so, he picked up another piece of garbage to examine...

Identifying and lecturing on Australian garbage lasted until Hearthstone Daoist himself started to get sleepy and yawn before ending. Zhou Lezhi was already sleepy beyond endurance. Waiting until serving the Teacher to sleep, it was past the third watch. He was so tired his bones were crisp and tendons numb—the Teacher's style of attending class anytime and anywhere was really somewhat unbearable.

Just arriving at the outer room of the study wanting to make do for the night on the footrest, suddenly he saw Wang Liang push the door and enter.

"The Master has instructions," Wang Liang suppressed his voice to almost a whisper, "Going to Dongyang in a few days, you must watch Hearthstone Daoist closely."
