# Chapter 2748: The Capital (Part 100)

"He's that bold?" Wu Kaidi said in shock. "Manager Qiao is from the Pingyao Qiao family! Even if he's from a branch line, the Qiaos won't let this go."

"So the forces behind the kidnapping probably aren't Shanxi House. First, the Xia family had no reason to be such villains. Second, Manager Shen doesn't have that kind of courage."

"So it must be the forces behind everything, as you said."

"Correct. Probably Manager Shen got some promise or benefit from them." Leng Ningyun tapped his head. "This is extremely complicated. Let the Foreign Intelligence people puzzle over it. Let's focus on the reopening."

The 100,000 taels Eunuch Yang had originally deposited were now prepared. Customarily, for large withdrawals by major depositors, they only needed to notify the bank, which would send it to their residence—no need for special representatives. Yet Eunuch Yang had specifically sent Baoyu.

"The silver is all ready." Leng Ningyun smiled pleasantly. "I've finally not failed Eunuch Yang's trust."

"Indeed, indeed." Baoyu was full of flattery. "I told Eunuch Yang: Grand Manager Leng is completely reliable, does things properly. Originally, there was no need to withdraw this silver. But Eunuch Yang has urgent need. No choice, no choice."

"Shall I load it on mule carts and transport it to the residence immediately, or..."

"No rush. Eunuch Yang has instructed: first take a look, verify everything. Just going through the process. Ha ha, ha ha." Baoyu gave a few dry laughs.

"Very well. That's only proper."

Leng Ningyun immediately led him to the rear courtyard. A hundred silver sheaths were laid out. In the Ming-Qing era, large amounts of silver weren't transported in boxes but in logs sawn in half, hollowed out in the middle. Fifty-tael ingots were placed end to end, fitted inside. Each sheath typically held ten ingots—a thousand taels. Once filled, the halves were joined and banded with iron hoops. No matter if bumped or dropped, they wouldn't come apart.

The sheaths were all open, the courtyard glowing with silver light. When Baoyu walked in, his legs went weak.

"Please inspect, Third Brother Bao."

Baoyu had never seen so much silver piled together. He felt his soul swaying. He barely steadied himself and went to inspect.

Leng Ningyun watched coolly. Normally, verification was just a formality. Large transfers from banks never involved fraud—otherwise, the bank's reputation would be ruined. That Baoyu was being so thorough was obviously on Eunuch Yang's specific instructions.

Has our bank's credibility fallen this low? This Eunuch Yang will need to be carefully dealt with later!

Still, the "father-son discord" offered an opening to find an opportunity to bring down Little Eunuch Yang.

After Baoyu finished inspecting, Assistant Manager Wei immediately ordered the sheaths sealed with iron hoops and stamped with seals. Baoyu returned the deposit slip. Leng Ningyun had it canceled and slipped a red envelope into his hand:

"Thank you for your trouble, Third Brother Bao!"

"Not at all, not at all." Baoyu was actually embarrassed. "I'm not being nosy. When you take someone's rice, you do their bidding. Please don't take it to heart, Manager Leng."

"Even blood brothers keep clear accounts. This is nothing." Leng Ningyun spoke with great sincerity. "I hope Third Brother Bao will look out for me in the future."

This wasn't just courtesy. For such an important matter, Eunuch Yang hadn't sent one of his personal junior eunuchs but rather Baoyu, a servant—indicating his rising status beside Eunuch Yang. There would be many uses for him in the future.

"I wouldn't dare. Wherever Manager Leng needs me, I'll do my best." With that, he took his leave. Assistant Manager Wei directed the clerks to load the silver onto carts, one after another, to be escorted by Heliansheng to the location Eunuch Yang designated.

"These father and son eunuchs are truly unrighteous. They took several thousand in commission on 100,000 taels, then after less than two months, they want it back—and still charge interest!" Assistant Manager Wei grumbled. "They might as well rob us!"

Leng Ningyun smiled. "These power-drunk eunuchs just rob money in different ways. We'll tolerate them for now. Before long, he'll be coming to deposit again."

On the eighth of the first month, 1637, Delong Bank in the capital finally reopened amidst great public attention. Leng Ningyun had ordered extra ten-thousand-character firecrackers. Several hundred strings dyed the whole street red.

The deliberately created festivity couldn't mask the tension of Delong's opening. Shuntian Prefecture and Wanping and Daxing counties had sent large squads of runners early to maintain order. Magistrate Liu of Shuntian even came personally, setting up his desk on the steps of a shop across the street.

"Post the proclamation!"

The large official proclamation was posted, immediately attracting a crowd of onlookers.

A considerable crowd had been waiting at Delong's door since hearing the news early that morning. They packed the street in front so densely that if the runners hadn't constantly shouted to clear a path, the entire street would have been blocked.

Inside Delong, though the clerks had been briefed and knew the biggest threat had been eliminated, seeing the sea of heads outside, the less experienced still drew sharp breaths.

"Assistant Manager Xiao! This—this—the Master said there'd be no problem, right?"

"What are you worried about? The Master handled those Shanxi fellows. Outside are just small depositors with at most fifty taels in notes. What's there to fear?"

Even so, Assistant Manager Xiao himself wasn't confident. True, he and Assistant Manager Wei had collected nearly 100,000 taels of Delong notes from the seven Shanxi Houses on the list without obstacle. Adding what Manager Leng had raised, handling the counter should be no problem. But seeing 100,000 taels of white silver carted away yesterday still pained him.

If only they could have delayed that withdrawal a few more days.

Though his heart was in turmoil, he had to feign calm. Manager Leng might be secretly watching him! So he shouted loudly everywhere, nitpicking everything, wanting not a speck of dust on the counter.

Seeing the shop ready inside and the runners positioned outside, he bellowed: "Open!"

At his shout, two apprentices opened the side door and began removing the door panels.

The crowd outside immediately surged, swarming toward the shop door. Among them were women and elderly. The Shuntian and county runners immediately cracked their long whips in the air, forcing the crowd back.

In the pushing and shoving, people were knocked down, crying out as they were trampled.

Magistrate Liu, sitting on the steps, quickly ordered his men to direct the runners to separate the crowd, leaving only one passage—entering on one side, exiting on the other. They also held back the later arrivals, admitting them in order. Only then was order maintained.

"Pass the word: anyone leading trouble or inciting the crowd is to be arrested on the spot and put in the cangue for public display!" he ordered.

Under this strong suppression, order at the shop entrance was finally maintained. But the depositors jostled frantically, chest to back, almost pressed together. Many women, whose husbands were working elsewhere and couldn't return in time to redeem, disregarded propriety and squeezed into the queue—and some took advantage to harass them. Some had their shoes trampled off, hairpins scattered, others fainted from the crush. The queue was a cacophony of crying, cursing, runners' shouts, the whoosh of swinging whips, and cries of pain from those struck.

From the lattice window on Delong's second floor, Leng Ningyun sighed silently. He was no longer worried about the run, but the chaos outside truly pained him.

Nine out of ten in line for redemption were the capital's small property-owning citizens—with a few taels to deposit for interest to supplement household expenses. This money, to great households, was merely an ink stick, a jar of "Nanyang fresh fruit," a piece of jewelry... But to them, it was blood and sweat saved over many years.

If the bank really collapsed, who knew how many of these people would drown or hang themselves!

He called Assistant Manager Wei and had him take some apprentices outside to set up a temporary shelter with a stove and hot sugar water, giving the elderly, weak, and fainted a place to rest.

"Tell Assistant Manager Xiao: all clerks on duty, all windows open. Get through these two days, then we'll treat everyone to a feast."

After arranging this, there was actually nothing to do. Leng Ningyun hadn't slept properly for days, yet felt no fatigue. He just sat on the second floor and watched.

Fortunately, with full-speed redemption, the crowd gradually thinned. By noon, no more people were arriving. The amount of silver and notes redeemed was within estimates.

Assistant Manager Xiao didn't dare relax. He kept the windows open, only having the kitchen make more buns and meat pies to send to the counter for the clerks to eat while working.

The anticipated large redemptions never materialized. The largest note was only five hundred-odd taels; most were five or ten tael small deposits and notes. Not until afternoon did someone come to redeem large notes all at once—and even then, only five thousand-odd taels.

As silver was paid out, the queue shortened. By closing time, the redemption crowd had dispersed completely. Everyone's suspended hearts finally settled. Assistant Manager Wei came out to thank the runners for their hard work, giving each a red envelope.

During the evening accounts, the total redeemed for the day was only 39,000-odd taels. Checking the deposit records, apart from deposits from "related enterprises" like the Shanhai Five Routes, ninety percent of fixed deposits had been redeemed. Over sixty percent of outstanding notes had returned. The remaining silver was more than enough.

From Leng Ningyun down to the apprentices, no one had felt like eating. They'd just had mantou and flatbread with strong tea while doing accounts. When the books finally balanced, everyone felt relieved. The whole place was filled with joy. Leng Ningyun immediately ordered the kitchen to prepare a lavish late-night meal.

"No drinking allowed, but otherwise enjoy yourselves. Just don't stay up too late—don't miss tomorrow's business."

"Don't worry, sir! We won't miss anything!" Assistant Manager Wei was elated. Never mind anything else—his 180 taels annual salary, plus year-end bonus, was now completely secure.

Leng Ningyun returned to the inner residence, quickly washed up and went to bed. His head hit the pillow and he was snoring.
