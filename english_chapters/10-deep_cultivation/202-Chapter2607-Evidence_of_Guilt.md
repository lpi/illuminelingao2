# Chapter 2607: Evidence of Guilt

In the main hall outside the County Magistrate's office of the Nanhai County Yamen, Zhang Jiayu, who had become a trainee advisor, was intently studying a new book borrowed from Senator Zhang Xiao's bookshelf—*Political Gains and Losses of Chinese Dynasties*, with "Published by the Grand Library Truth Office, Compiled by Zhang Haogu" prominently written on the cover.

Originally, Zhang Haogu had written just "Authored by," but unexpectedly, this move caused a strong backlash. It met with resolute opposition from the Grand Library and a group of Senators with backgrounds in literature, history, and philosophy within the Senate. They believed that Qian Mu had only a few works, and Zhang Haogu couldn't play the trick of "first come, first served" to list this masterpiece directly under his own name.

After a round of verbal and written attacks, Zhang Haogu could only settle for the next best thing, getting a "Compiled by."

Zhang Jiayu naturally didn't know the little episode behind this book. These days, his life was a two-point line, moving between the Provincial and Port General Hospital and the Shen'ao Society. Under the care of Lin Motian and Zhang Xiao, Mother Zhang's condition was getting better, and she could be discharged soon. Zhang Xiao called him to the county yamen for business today, so he was in the mood to spare a large amount of time to sit here and read.

Closing the book, Zhang Jiayu thought to himself: *I didn't expect that among these Australian Chiefs, there are also people so knowledgeable about the past and present, seeing things so clearly as to explore the political gains and losses of the Han, Tang, Song, and Ming dynasties from personnel and systems. This is unprecedented. Court organization, fiscal taxation, selection systems, national defense and military systems can all be described as the foundation of a nation, and we should take them as warnings.*

Heroes have always cherished each other since ancient times. Although Zhang Jiayu didn't know who this Zhang Haogu was, reading this book, he truly admired him in his heart: *The Australians are not "uncultured and unrefined," only skilled in "strange techniques and craftiness."*

However, he was currently facing a dilemma. His mentor Lin Jian and sworn brother Zhang Mu were both involved in Daoist Wood Stone's anti-Kun conspiracy, and he was inexplicably assigned the task of infiltrating the Kun thieves' puppet court as an undercover agent. Judging by the actual results, his task completion was perfect; he became Zhang Xiao's trainee advisor almost effortlessly. But he had to admit that he had received great kindness from Zhang Xiao and the Senate this time. Repaying kindness with enmity was definitely not what a chivalrous person would do. But asking him to watch his relatives and friends being arrested by the Senate without doing anything was also absolutely impossible.

In ancient times, Guan Yunchang received the grace of appreciation from Cao Cao, and he beheaded Yan Liang and Zhu Wen chou to repay it. When he learned the whereabouts of Imperial Uncle Liu, he resolutely abandoned glory and wealth, passing five passes and slaying six generals, riding a thousand miles alone to escort his sister-in-law back to the Han camp. At this time, Zhang Jiayu was at an age of bursting confidence. He planned in his heart to emulate Guan Yu's old story: he would solve a thorny problem for Zhang Xiao, then leave with a flick of his sleeves, while also preserving his teachers and friends. This would both repay the Chief's great kindness and not violate righteousness.

At this moment, a person walked in hurriedly from outside, his face bruised and purple, pasted with plasters, holding a stack of objects looking like manuscripts in his hand, and showing a smile that looked unfriendly at first glance from time to time.

The person who came was Huang Xiyin, who was beaten and injured by Kuang Lu the day before yesterday. Seeing Zhang Jiayu holding a new-style book as if thinking about its mysteries, he stepped forward and said, "The younger generation is formidable. My little brother is so diligent; you will surely have a great future. I heard about your matter. Little brother got the opportunity to be taken under the Chief's wing; do not disappoint the Chief's deep love."

Zhang Jiayu stood up and bowed to Huang Xiyin, saying, "Councilor Huang praises me too much. Chief Zhang has magic hands and a benevolent heart; he is a dragon and phoenix among men. Thanks to the Chief not discarding me, ordering Jiayu to follow him, Jiayu will naturally strive to repay."

"Is the Chief in the office?" Huang Xiyin asked.

"Commissioner Liu is talking in detail inside. Does Councilor Huang have urgent business?" Zhang Jiayu asked.

"Oh, then no rush, I'll wait." Huang Xiyin then sat down next to Zhang Jiayu's seat and chatted with him.

Huang Xiyin was a *Jinshi* graduate and had served as the Magistrate of Nanhai. His knowledge and vision were not comparable to Zhang Jiayu, who came from a poor background. talking with him, Zhang Jiayu felt he benefited greatly. His grandfather Huang Fengxiang was the second place *Jinshi* in the Wuxu year of the Longqing reign of the Ming Dynasty, the Emperor-appointed *Bangyan*, rising to Minister of Rites and posthumously titled Wenjian. Starting from Huang Fengxiang, the Huang clan had eight *Jinshi* in four generations and ten *Juren*, becoming a prominent family in Quanzhou. This Huang Xiyin surrendered to the Manchus in history and, as Zheng Zhilong's fellow villager, once persuaded Zheng Zhilong to surrender to the Manchus. Therefore, Zhang Xiao was not surprised by his defection and his attitude towards Huang Xiyin was obviously different from other surrendered officials in Guangzhou.

Yang Tinglin, Zhang Pu, Chen Yutai, Wu Weiye, Mai Erxuan, and Chen Shiji were all his *Jinshi* classmates. Yang Tinglin and Zhang Pu need not be mentioned; Chen Yutai was the *Zhuangyuan* on the same list and was related by marriage to Zhou Yanru; Wu Weiye was a fellow villager of Zhang Pu and was known as one of the "Three Masters of Jiangzuo" along with Qian Qianyi and Gong Dingzi; Mai Erxuan participated in Chen Zizhuang's anti-Qing team; Chen Shiji was from Wenchang, Hainan, and because he was mourning at home, he didn't have the chance to run out of the Senate's rule and had closed his doors. Therefore, Huang Xiyin's connections in the Ming officialdom were not shallower than those of Chen Zizhuang, He Wuzou, and others at all, and he would definitely be of great use in the Senate's continued northward strategy in the future.

Before coming to the county yamen, Huang Xiyin heard that Zhang Jiayu had skin like congealed fat and was exceptionally beautiful. He originally thought he was an embroidered pillow, possibly a male favorite newly kept by Zhang Xiao. Entering just now and seeing him studying hard and intently, and after talking, realizing this person was broad-minded and quite chivalrous, Huang Xiyin felt that Zhang Xiao had a sharp eye for talent. Recruiting such a talent for the Senate after just one meeting, it seemed the specific assignment of Chief Zhang to Nanhai by the Senate was indeed a well-thought-out plan.

"Chief Zhang, I wonder what you plan to do with Kuang Lu?" Liu Dalin, who had finished reporting on the gathering, asked Zhang Xiao.

"Old Liu, you know the Senate's system. We rule the country by law. We cannot convict without hard evidence, how can we incriminate someone based on writing?" Out of disgust for Qianlong's literary inquisitions, many Senators including Zhang Xiao had always been uninterested in and disgusted by such "unwarranted" convictions and guilt by association.

"The Great Song is indeed different, setting a precedent for a generation, truly the sign of a king." Hearing Zhang Xiao say this, Liu Dalin felt relieved from the bottom of his heart, knowing how many people had been spared a bloodbath.

"However, although we don't wrong a good person, we won't let a bad person go either." Zhang Xiao added a sentence.

Liu Dalin nodded and said, "The He, Yao, and Zhao families should be honest now, only the Chen Zizhuang brothers still need more work."

Zhang Xiao said, "If you still cherish that friendship of classmates and want to continue doing ideological work, I won't stop you. But if Chen Zizhuang is—a tortoise eating a scale weight—determined to oppose the Senate, even a Great Luo Immortal can't save him..." After speaking, he sighed. To be honest, there were many in the Senate who had good feelings towards these loyal and righteous men of Lingnan, and he didn't want it to end in a river of blood.

Huang Xiyin and Zhang Jiayu chatted randomly in the main hall. Not knowing how long had passed, Liu Sixian pushed Liu Dalin's wheelchair out of the county magistrate's office. Only then did he knock on the half-open door with the materials in his hands.

"Come in." Zhang Xiao looked up. "It's Councilor Huang. Come, sit. Is the injury better?"

Huang Xiyin walked straight to the desk and said to Zhang Xiao, "Thank you for your concern, Chief. They are all skin trauma, nothing serious. This is the evidence of Kuang Lu's crimes collected by this student. This villain is extremely arrogant and harbors evil intentions; he must be severely punished."

"Oh? Let me see what there is." Zhang Xiao became interested, wanting to see what black materials Huang Xiyin had collected on Kuang Lu.

Huang Xiyin turned a page, pointed to the text on it and said, "These are all rebel poems written by that fellow Kuang Lu. Chief, please look at this one."

Zhang Xiao took the manuscript and saw written on it:

*Guilin Clan Marquis Banquet Collection*

*Cassia spirit intoxicates the fragrant night, heartstrings moved by the beauty.*
*Jade Dragon has no remaining tricks, Golden Goose implies remaining spring.*
*Cursive script flies like skirt ribbons, Flower Lord passes like sock dust.*
*Why at this season, sending off guests but leaving the Kun alone.*

Huang Xiyin said, "This poem points at the mulberry and curses the locust tree. It says he has the heart to send off guests but cannot send off the Senate's cadres. The reactionary heart leaps onto the paper; Sima Zhao's intent is known to every passerby!"

Zhang Xiao flipped through other poems and found it a bit absurdly amusing. Although his classical Chinese level wasn't comparable to professional Senators like Zhang Haogu and Yu E'shui, he graduated from Jiuyanqiao University anyway and had hung out in the Grand Library for a while, so he could guess seventy or eighty percent. It was just that these so-called "rebel poems" used extremely many allusions and loved to use obscure characters. Zhang Xiao knew many words were likely allusions, but with his knowledge base, he simply couldn't see what allusion was being used.

Zhang Xiao had just told Liu Dalin that he wouldn't engage in literary inquisition, but he couldn't throw cold water directly on Huang Xiyin. What if he really dug up some hard evidence? So he said, "Not bad. Councilor Huang is meticulous and capable, collecting so much evidence in just a few days. However, our Great Song is founded on law; these evidences are not yet enough to convict. With Councilor Huang's sincere heart, I believe more criminal evidence can be collected. When the time comes, we will catch them all in one net."

Huang Xiyin was momentarily unsure if Zhang Xiao was speaking earnestly or sarcastically, and couldn't help asking, "This is still not enough to convict?"

Zhang Xiao smiled slightly and said, "Judge by deeds, not by heart."

Huang Xiyin said, "Student understands."

Just as Huang Xiyin entered the office to communicate with Zhang Xiao, two women entered the county yamen. The leader wore a female cadre uniform. Her appearance was proper and gentle, looking about twenty-something in Ming people's eyes. Following behind her was a fifteen or sixteen-year-old girl.

The girl's eyes were full of spirit. She was five *chi* tall, obviously taller than ordinary women. Her long straight black hair was distinct from the shoulder-length short hair of the Senate's female students and female cadres, very conspicuous. A simple cadre uniform couldn't hide her proud figure.

Zhang Jiayu heard footsteps and wanted to see who came. He looked up inadvertently, but what he saw was "Two cheeks like blooming peaches reflecting from a mirror, a gaze like spring water chilling people." The water was eyes rippling; the mountain was brows gathering. Asking the pedestrian where they are going? To where the brows and eyes are brimming.

The leading woman was about to go straight to the county magistrate's office. Zhang Jiayu came back to his senses, stood up and said to her, "Chief Zhang is discussing matters with someone. Please wait a moment."
