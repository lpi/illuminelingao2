# Chapter 2624: Reporting

At dusk, cadres out for inspection returned to the camp one after another. After days of visits, cadres all accumulated much first-hand information. They held a meeting every day after returning to camp. Borrowing the light emitted by lead-acid battery-powered electric lamps, cadres reported their respective inspected parts. Zhang Xiao and Li Yao'er both listened carefully, asking a few questions from time to time.

Chen Wuren reported: "...Local floods occur frequently. Once the enclosure dike bursts, the most serious cases cause drowning of human lives, collapse of houses, and damage to crops. Next are fish ponds. Calculating per pond, from the first month removing old water and changing irrigation with new water, retting water to feed fish, needs of grass and feces, lasting five or six months, pond consumes ten gold. Escape of fish is uncountable. loss of other goods drifting away is also hard to urge (calculate). After dike burst, rescue should be done as early as possible within ten days. Those with public wealth to borrow should do their best to fund repairing enclosure dikes. Those without public wealth to borrow can only levy according to property owners doing their utmost. Must guarantee planting late rice. Wait for mulberry shoots to sprout leaves, supplementing silkworm matters. Ponds producing fish can be planted again. Losing at sunrise, can still gain at sunset. If delayed for more than ten days without construction, then previous flood just subsided, later flood rises continuously..."

Listening to the report, Zhang Xiao quickly noted down a point in the notebook: Water conservancy is the most important work for Sangyuan Enclosure development. The Enclosure Directorates of various enclosures lack a unified coordination mechanism suitable for adding an agency for unified management, including Shunde.

"Are there any other matters worth noting?" Zhang Xiao asked.

Chen Wuren thought and said, "Speaking of which, there actually is. Many fish farming households reflected that fertilizer is particularly lacking these two years."

"Oh? What reason?"

Chen Wuren said, "Heard the Zhu clan opened some patent medicine shop, acquiring silkworm feces (*Can Sha*) in large quantities, used for refining medicinal materials. The acquisition price is also given particularly high, so many silkworm households sold silkworm feces to the Zhu clan, leading to insufficient fish pond fertilizer."

"Silkworm feces?" Zhang Xiao stroked his mustache thoughtfully.

Li Yao'er seeing him silent, asked, "Is there a problem?"

Zhang Xiao said, "This is indeed a Chinese medicinal material. *Compendium of Materia Medica* records silkworm feces has effects of treating diabetes (*Xiao Ke*), women's metrorrhagia, head wind, dispelling wind and removing dampness. Other ancient medical books also have similar records. From the perspective of modern medicine, the main component of silkworm feces extract is sodium iron chlorophyllin, used to treat iron deficiency anemia. Just..."

"Just what?" Li Yao'er was somewhat curious.

"No matter how useful this medicine is, it shouldn't be acquired to the point where local fish farming households lack fertilizer." Zhang Xiao said.

Silkworm feces as a medicinal material didn't have universality like licorice; uses were limited. Calculating with the usage of Guangzhou Prefecture for a year, it probably wouldn't exceed a few hundred *jin*. How could it reach the extent of silkworm feces being strangely scarce in the market?

"Something fishy?" Li Yao'er asked.

"Can't say, just feel something is wrong somewhere." Under the situation of limited information, Zhang Xiao couldn't say the reason either, saying: "Speaking of lack of fertilizer alone, if the artificial breeding base is built, fish fry production doubles. Relying on farmyard manure alone is definitely not enough. No matter how efficient mulberry dike fish ponds are, they cannot create nutrients out of thin air. The material input of the whole system is fixed. If not supplementing fertilizer additionally, unit yield still can't go up. Our chemical fertilizer technology hasn't broken through yet; lack of fertilizer will be a serious problem existing for a long time."

"Then what to do? You blew out the cow skin (boasted)." Li Yao'er smiled with bad intentions.

"Old Sister rest assured. I blow cow skin relying on the score (reliably)," Zhang Xiao said: "Changpo Phase I which Shi Chuyou has been doggedly working on was put into production two years ago. Using 'Shi Chuyou Sulfuric Acid Method' from brown coal tail gas there can recover ten thousand tons of ammonium sulfate annually. The two of us work hard, walk around everywhere. Half the quota of Changpo Phase I fertilizer supply specifically to Jiujiang. Good steel must be used on the blade edge."

"This can be done. Engaging in industry requires talking about return on investment. Fertilizer naturally should be used in agricultural sectors with high returns." Li Yao'er also agreed with Zhang Xiao's opinion.

"Sigh, this little fertilizer still won't last long. Shi Chuyou originally planned to launch Changpo Phase II, planning 40 furnaces. Tail gas recovery can produce at least fifty to one hundred thousand tons of ammonium sulfate annually, incidentally having eight thousand tons of gasoline capacity. It's just that now with Brunei petroleum competition, I see it's very hanging (precarious)."

"Aren't you a hardcore Southward faction?"

"Engaging in petroleum is not wrong, but waiting for the petrochemical industry to produce fertilizer don't know which monkey year and horse month. Might as well place hope on Chen Huan and others to quickly settle self-produced synthetic ammonia devices." Speaking and speaking Zhang Xiao drifted away.

"Hey, don't digress. Pay attention to meeting efficiency." Li Yao'er reminded.

"Okay okay okay, back to the main topic... Uh, if other families did this silkworm feces thing, possibly I wouldn't take it to heart. But the Zhu clan is different; his family is Chen Zizhuang's maternal uncle." Zhang Xiao thought and was still uneasy, instructing Mo Yu: "Old Mo, keep an eye on this matter. See what exactly the Zhu clan is playing. Report anytime if there is a situation."

Next was Zhao Hening's inspection report:

"...Examining silkworm farmers' lives in detail, except for the pressing period when silkworm babies grow up, after each crop's rearing work is completed, and during the young silkworm period, there is still one to two weeks of leisure time. Therefore, often utilizing this time, taking other coolie jobs outside. After harvest crop, besides field and garden work, can still do other coolie work part-time, filling family miscellaneous expenses. Result of hard work all day, although insufficient to compensate expenditure deficit, the difference number is not too big. Borrowing from various sides and trying best to be frugal, tax and levy barely maintained. Besides this, there is no other better way. Mulberry dike fish ponds indeed can create more wealth than rice planting, and can also let farmers live a relatively more ample life. However, since commercial agriculture requires high investment and has huge risks, farmers have almost no ability to avoid risks. This implies they may work hard all year round, but finally still have to fall into thorough poverty..."

"Not bad. Hening has progress." Listening to Zhao Hening's report, Zhang Xiao praised.

Zhao Hening laughed, two eyes curving into crescent shapes, saying modestly: "Famous teachers produce high disciples; still two teachers taught well."

Li Yao'er said: "The commercialization degree of Jiujiang farmers' lives is already very high under current social conditions. Quality of life is also stronger than farmers in other places. However, the gap between rich and poor looks very big; social contradictions are not small. Hening, have you collected exact data on silkworm farmers' income and expenditure?"

"Extremely difficult to obtain exact data. Silkworm farmers don't have the habit of bookkeeping, often cannot recall the income and expenditure of a year. We can only speculate out of thin air, make baseless answers. So [we] had to experience the situation, estimating on their behalf according to daily life, to verify whether our speculated answers are wrong."

"Then did you encounter any special situations?" Li Yao'er asked.

"Yes, I was just about to say," Seeing Li Yao'er ask actively, Zhao Hening seized the opportunity, saying: "We met a mother and son, particularly miserable. I felt her living in this life really meant nothing. Her only wish now is to divorce her dead ghost husband. I feel we must manage this matter..." Then Zhao Hening described Huang *Shi* and her son's experience vividly, simply making listeners sad and hearers weep.

Li Yao'er couldn't help complaining: "How can there be such a dad in the world?"

Zhang Xiao said: "Over a hundred people, of all shades and descriptions; when the forest is big, all kinds of birds exist."

Huang *Shi* and her son's situation evoked Chen Wuren's memory. He interrupted: "Two Chiefs, ever heard of 'Eating the Extinct Household' (*Chi Juehu*)?"

As a post-80s generation, Zhang Xiao was not unfamiliar with rural life. The so-called Eating the Extinct Household means when a man in a family dies, if there are no other males in the family, people will come to carve up this family's property, even not sparing daily necessities like pots and bowls. These people are no others, usually the same-clan relatives of this family. There is also a form of forcing the male master's wife to host running feasts, until eating this family thoroughly finished, poor, and extinct. After property is carved up completely, these relatives will also bully the orphan and widow in various ways, driving them out of the house. Some possessors have to be reduced to prostitutes.

The situation of Eating the Extinct Household became popular from the mid-to-late Ming Dynasty. Even the talented woman Liu Rushi at the end of Ming failed to escape. After Qian Qianyi died, Qian clan members gathered to rob the house property. To protect Qian Qianyi's family property, Liu Rushi made a will and hanged herself. A generation of romantic talented woman's fragrance vanished and jade perished, extremely tragic. This time was only two months away from Qian Qianyi passing away.

"You mean, someone is eating the extinct household of Guan Youde's family?" Zhang Xiao asked.

"Although Guan Youde is still alive, judging from the actual situation, it is no different from eating the extinct household." Chen Wuren said: "According to Miss Zhao's statement, Guan Youde has been sick for ten years. Everyone thinks his life won't be long, including himself. To treat the illness, his family property was basically all sold at low prices to same-clan relatives. Proverb says 'Poor not long with sons, rich not long without sons.' Guan Youde only has one only son. Initially when Guan Zongbao was young, whether he could live to adulthood was still an unknown number. Don't know who used what magic soup to make Guan Youde willing to let his young son give up studying to go home and raise fish. The person coming up with this bad plan should have harbored the thought of letting his son also return West early. A medicine jar like Guan Youde would pass away in five or six years at most; rare are those dragging for ten years. I think this is also a situation his same-clan relatives didn't expect. I also met a person named Guan Youde in the Fish Flower Market. This person had vegetable yellow face color, Yintang (forehead) dark, looking like life not long. Should be the person mentioned by Miss Zhao."

"Hmph," Li Yao'er snorted coldly, "How can there be such vicious people in this world!"

"Calm down, calm down. Are such things few in the countryside? Even if your family has a son, others may not necessarily like to see you live better than them. Even on the day we stepped on the Fengcheng Wheel, things of eating the extinct household were still staging. Without changing the backward productive forces and deformed system of rural areas, similar tragedies won't stop." Zhang Xiao looked at Li Yao'er, seeking her opinion, saying: "However, I think this matter can be managed. What is your view?"

"Changing customs (*Yifeng Yisu*), why not do it?" Li Yao'er said with a smile.
