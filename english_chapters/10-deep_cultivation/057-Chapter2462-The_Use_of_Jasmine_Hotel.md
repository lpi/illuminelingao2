# Chapter 2462 - The Use of Jasmine Hotel

Liu Dalin had unspeakable suffering. Once, he couldn't help but sigh and pour out his bitterness to Tang Tang at a tea party of the Consultative Council.

Tang Tang had specialized in working with these "influential old natives" in recent years and understood their thoughts very well. Her work, besides making them "cooperate with peace of mind," was to guide them to "accept new things."

How to accept new things? It was nothing more than visiting and comparing the two worlds of the new and old societies. This was a traditional method, quite effective; but for the Senate, this was not enough. Not only did they need to be "convinced," but these "old people" also needed to be integrated. And the best way to integrate was to let them participate in industry.

Running an industry would inevitably involve new technologies, new ideas, and new business models, and the huge benefits of running an industry were irresistible to human nature. The Senate had used this method repeatedly over the years with great success, tying more and more "influential natives" to the war chariot.

Originally, because of Liu Dalin's indifferent nature, this method didn't work much. But Tang Tang keenly grasped the opportunity from Jinshi Liu's troubles and suggested he open a hotel.

"Open an inn?" Jinshi Liu was confused for a moment. What did this have to do with opening an inn?

"Think about it. If you open an inn, when these distant guests come, you can settle them all in the inn. You and your family don't have to greet and accompany them all the time, leaving peace at home. This is the first point."

This first point attracted Liu Dalin.

"Secondly, among relatives and old friends, there's always a distinction between close and distant. If you treat everyone regardless of closeness, and they stay for ten days, half a month, or even months, no family has mountains of gold and silver..."

These words spoke to Liu Dalin's heart. Although Jinshi Liu didn't manage the household, he could tell from his wife's increasingly furrowed brows that household finances were not easy. Moreover, his wife had complained many times about the "disturbance" of relatives and friends.

"What the young lady says is true, but they came from thousands of miles away. It's fine if I don't keep them at home, but if I ask them to pay for staying in a hotel, this is somewhat, somewhat..." Jinshi Liu still couldn't save face.

"What's difficult about this." Tang Tang laughed, "Now 'all who come are guests,' but your old relatives and friends treat you as a fat sheep, pulling the wool desperately? With an inn, you can set a rule..."

"Pulling wool?" This was the first time Liu Dalin heard this term. He found it interesting and, on second thought, quite apt and vivid.

"What rule?"

"Divide guests into three categories. The first category: close relatives and close friends stay for free, however many come, and all expenses are settled by your residence."

Liu Dalin couldn't help nodding.

"The second category: strictly limited to free reception for one master and one servant; everyone else pays for their own food and lodging. The last category: accommodation costs are self-paid, but with a 20% discount. You can also make a rule: limiting reception to a certain number of days; exceeding the limit, all expenses are self-paid. Otherwise, some people come and stay for one or two months..."

Liu Dalin thought this was indeed a good method. Why hadn't he thought of it before?!

"The method is a good method, but this inn..." Liu Dalin spread his hands, "Although there are some savings at home, running an inn is not a simple matter. Land, house, and who will manage it..."

"As for the inn, if you want to run it, I will naturally help fully." Tang Tang struck while the iron was hot, "Can't you trust the Senate's credit?"

He naturally trusted the Senate's credit. Liu Dalin went back and pondered for two days, deciding to "Open!"

Saying to open was easy, but there was no money or land. Tang Tang had long prepared a plan for him. Use the land under the Liu family's name as collateral to apply for a loan from the Delong Lingao Branch.

Naturally, this money was not enough, but Tang Tang immediately and considerately expressed that the Affairs Office of the Consultative Council was willing to make up the shortfall, considering it a joint venture—some public and private receptions of the Consultative Council originally needed a hotel. This not only solved the funding gap but also brought customers, killing two birds with one stone, convenient for both public and private. Liu Dalin naturally did not object.

As soon as the news spread that Liu Dalin and the Consultative Council were jointly running a hotel, the members of the Consultative Council in the county also expressed their willingness to "invest," each contributing a little, investing half a share or a share, just for fun.

So this project was set up in Liu Dalin's name. The land for building the hotel was specially selected in the "New Town Area" by the Wenlan River in Bopu: not far from the coast, facing the Wenlan River. The overall environment belonged to quietness amidst noise. The hotel was named Jasmine Hotel (Moli Hotel), taking the name from "Jasmine Pavilion Academy."

The architectural design and overall renovation of this Jasmine Hotel were done by the "returnee" Zhang Xingpei. Designer Zhang was very disgusted with the Bauhaus style and Neoclassical architectural schools flooding the Senate, so he found a new path and created a "Mediterranean style." Although Lingao didn't match the Mediterranean climate at all, the climate was hot all year round, with distinct dry and wet seasons, and plants were evergreen, so some related scene atmosphere could be replicated more or less. Thus, this unique Jasmine Hotel was designed.

The shape, color scheme, decoration, and plant embellishment of Jasmine Hotel were basically built according to the architecture on popular tourist islands in the Aegean Sea of the old timeline. It was not only unrelated to the traditional classical style but also vastly different from the Commercial Hall Hotel, Longhao Bay Hotel, and other hotels run by the Senate. However, overall, it coordinated with the style of the Bopu New Town Area. As soon as it was built, it attracted the attention of many "artsy" Elders. Although this hotel was not by the sea, sitting on the roof, one could overlook the seascape of Bopu. Coupled with the surrounding environment and plants deliberately arranged and embellished by Designer Zhang, it could really be counted as very "Greek."

Putting aside aesthetic views, Jasmine Hotel was also a hotel of considerable scale, with a total of twenty single and double rooms, and ten twelve-person rooms with bunk beds configured similarly to youth hostels at low prices. Washing equipment was complete. Not luxurious, but the equipment was complete and comfortable. Coupled with the unique "exotic atmosphere" and "artistic sense," it quickly became a local hotel of quite some grade. Wu Nanhai naturally did not forget this place and opened a branch of Nanhai Coffee House here.

In addition to ordinary tourists, for those scholars coming to Lingao for the first time, the "exotic atmosphere" of Jasmine Hotel opened their eyes, and the unique "artistic breath" made them linger. Not only outsiders, but even local scholars liked to come to sit in the courtyard and roof garden here. Liu Dalin, the former "Headmaster" of Jasmine Pavilion, often came to the hotel to have pure talks with scholars—this was also Tang Tang's suggestion; she called it "advertising."

Chen Lin finished registering, and a waiter took him to the guest room. This guest room was on the first floor, more grounded compared to the high-rise buildings of Longhao Bay Hotel.

The waiter drew the curtains and opened the long French windows. Chen Lin walked out leisurely. Outside the window was a wooden terrace equipped with white railings. There were rattan woven tables and chairs on the terrace. Outside the terrace was the hotel's garden. The garden was actually not big, but decorated quite exquisitely. Green vines wound around cast-iron flower stands; flower pots planted with green plants hung on white lampposts; gravel paved paths meandered past the terrace, looking vibrant under the sunlight.

When had Chen Lin ever seen such an arrangement? Standing on the terrace, he was entranced for a moment. He didn't wake up from his dream until the waiter brought a tea set to greet him.

"This is the Elder Black Tea specially served by our shop. If the guest thinks the scenery here is good, how about taking a nap here and tasting tea?"

"Good, good," how could Chen Lin say "bad"? He immediately said, "Just put it here."

The waiter put down the tea set on the small round table. Chen Lin took out his wallet to give a "tip," but the waiter politely refused: "The service charge is already included in the guest's accommodation fee, so tips are not accepted."

Chen Lin thought this was fresh! But Australian shops indeed did not accept "tips."

The waiter withdrew. Chen Lin sat down on the rattan chair on the terrace and picked up the teapot—the teapot was "Australian style" he had seen in Guangzhou, with glaze crystal clear and translucent, seemingly semi-transparent, painted with delicate and dripping flowers—he didn't know what method was used to fire it. He heard from his uncle that there was a bid for a porcelain factory at this industrial auction, but it failed because the investment required too much capital.

The tea poured into the cup was dark red, the tea soup transparent, and a rich and strong tea fragrance rushed straight to the nose. This was "Black Tea" unique to Australians. It was sold in Guangzhou a few years ago, but because the aroma was special and too strong, it was not welcomed by Guangdong locals; instead, Westerners loved it very much. It was said that this tea was durable for storage. However, the "Ice Black Tea" sold in Great World in summer gained the love of many people—this was truly a grotesque thing.

Chen Lin didn't mind the special bitter and astringent aroma of hot black tea. He took a sip. Within the tea fragrance, there was a strong citrus aroma rushing straight to the nose. This aroma was not the citrus aroma in "Ice Black Tea," but close to the smell of bergamot. It wasn't necessarily delicious, but it wasn't hard to drink either; he just felt the taste was very special.

"This tea is strange."

However, having seen operations like putting citrus slices and sugar into black tea in the tea shops of Great World, he wouldn't be surprised by anything Australians did to this black tea.

He leaned back on the rattan chair, flower fragrance and tea fragrance curling at his nose. With the beautiful garden before his eyes and looking up at the azure sky, for a time he just felt happy and free of worries.

*Truly a good place to kill time,* Chen Lin thought. *As Uncle said: Australians are the people who know how to enjoy most in the world!* This enjoyment was not extravagant luxury of substituting expensive for cheap, nor the accumulation like lakes of wine and forests of meat, but comfort and coziness that truly cut into the bottom of people's hearts.

However, he couldn't just sink into "coziness" like this. Chen Lin reminded himself secretly that he not only carried the family's industry but also his uncle's heavy trust, neither of which could be let down.
