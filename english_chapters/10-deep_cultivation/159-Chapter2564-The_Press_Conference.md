# Chapter 2564: The Press Conference

Gentry and heads of households from Guangzhou, Nanhai, and Panyu, some bringing their families, some bringing servants, entered the academy one after another. Quite a few citizens concerned about the Senate's new policies also came. Sharp-nosed small merchants and peddlers all set up stalls outside the academy gates doing temporary business. For the Senators' safety, Liu Xiang specially transferred personnel from the Guangzhou National Army Saber Squad, arranging them at the entrance for security. He also specially selected several people from among the old runners who had served at the former Guangdong Examination Hall to be responsible for searches, checking whether visitors carried dangerous items.

These old runners were all veterans at searching examination candidates; their searching experience was extremely rich. As long as no one gave the nod to let something pass, all kinds of strange cheating objects could be found. Only they generally weren't a bit polite to ordinary people. Many scholars both hated and feared the Examination Hall's "searches." Good-looking ones, young ones, inevitably would have these runners' hands wandering all over them, "feeling up" and "taking advantage." So their reputation was extremely bad.

Therefore, when Mu Min recruited these people to serve as security inspectors, she also did good training work. Especially standardizing the search procedures, clarifying which parts could be touched and with what force, prohibiting groping all over the body, to avoid causing unnecessary disputes.

To facilitate searching females, she also recruited several female security inspectors from among these people's female relatives.

Chen Bangyan, under the security officer's direction, raised hands, turned, lifted feet. After confirming no abnormalities over his whole body, he was let through. The instant he passed by the security officer, Chen Bangyan and the other met eyes briefly, nodded slightly, then quickly walked past.

After the dry and lengthy policy lecture, Liu Xiang continued:

"Next, let's invite Senator Ren Youzi, Secretary of the Guangzhou Securities Regulatory Commission, to speak about the recent Paper Cotton disturbance and answer reporters' questions!"

Holding a press conference was the Propaganda Department's suggestion. Besides *Yangcheng Express*, Guangzhou currently had several newspaper offices and magazine publishers.

Although some Senators felt having multiple newspapers was unnecessary, the Propaganda Department believed having several news organizations wasn't a bad thing. After all, indigenous people's demand for information was currently very high; whether for promoting literacy, publicizing new policies, or spreading science, more channels were needed.

These newspapers and publications mostly had Australian backgrounds, most relocated from Lingao. Including established publications like *Tianshui Living Weekly*, *Readers' Friend*, *Dianshizhai Pictorial*, and so on. There were also purely private capital ventures—yes, some indigenous people had already realized the significance of "newspapers." Although their concepts of "news" and "media" remained fuzzy.

At a Naturalized Citizen cadre's signal, everyone began to applaud. Accompanied by applause, a middle-aged man wearing a white shirt and black pants walked to the microphone. He cleared his throat twice. Smiling, he opened his mouth, but the speaker produced no sound. The frowning man tapped the microphone; still no movement. The indigenous people could be excused, but from the Naturalized Citizen cadres behind came a burst of quiet discussion, faintly hearing dialogue like "malfunctioned again" and "this was the latest technology."

Ren Youzi turned to call a young person, saying quietly: "Bring the amplifier over—right, right, right, the one you call 'Big Voice.'

"Hello, hello, hello." "Everyone please quiet." "Please be quiet."

Ren spoke while pressing his hands flat and down to signal; the crowd gradually quieted down.

"I don't think I came late today." Ren smiled a bit, but there was no reaction from below. Ren shook his head slightly.

"Comrades, greetings. Journalists, greetings. Fathers and elders of Guangzhou, greetings. Today, on behalf of the Senate, I will briefly discuss the administration's views on some small fluctuations that recently appeared in the Guangzhou financial market, as well as the measures we will take."

"We have noticed that recently, some traders and investors have been investing and trading in so-called Paper Cotton. This is a financial instrument that emerged spontaneously among the people. We believe everyone's original intentions were good—wanting to solve the practical need for buyers and sellers to lock in future costs and benefits, wanting to promote the long-term development of our planting and textile industries."

Voices of agreement came from the crowd; many nodded frequently.

"However, Paper Cotton, this kind of not-yet-very-standardized, not-yet-mature forward contract, when actually operated, because there is no constraint from a powerful intermediary guarantee institution, produced many irrational behaviors. For example, we observed unrealistic naked shorting, cornering, excessively high turnover rate, quotes seriously deviating from recent transaction price, self-buying and self-selling, wash trading, blindly adding leverage, ah, leading some people with weak bearing capacity to have some, tragedies. These are all not manifestations of a healthy market."

"So, what conclusion did the Finance Ministry reach after analysis? We are saying, this Paper Cotton should have been regulated long ago!"

Everyone looked at each other, then began discussing in small groups.

Senator Ren, maintaining his smile, continued speaking.

"Since the Guangzhou Exchange was established, it has successively issued non-preferred stocks and bonds of excellent and efficient large enterprises and companies including Nanyang Company, Dabo Shipping, Runshitang, Foshan Steel, and so on. This has opened a highway for financing the real economy while also providing better investment choices for investors. Achievements are there for all to see; the administration also highly affirms them, ah, highly affirms."

"However, this recent private Paper Cotton trading has sounded an alarm for us. Off-exchange trading without government supervision—although the trading itself doesn't count as illegal—the risk is extremely high. Some investors don't have this ability, you know, yet insist on borrowing at high interest. Results in such big problems! No choice but to sell themselves to Nanyang... ah, this selling oneself... is very difficult, that is. Previously, regarding this derivative product, we didn't pay enough attention. I also need to make a self-criticism here. We didn't timely guide everyone's urgent needs onto a path of standardization and specification, leading to the current situation. We also feel deeply pained."

"Next, we will begin a 100-Day Major Action to Crack Down on Illegal Trading, thoroughly cleaning up various illegal behaviors. Additionally, we are also researching, ah, this research... researching what? Mainly researching how to satisfy everyone's... investment needs. I know Guangzhou is a prosperous and wealthy place; the amount of idle social capital is very large. So we are also researching, besides bonds, are there other directions for investment? This Paper Cotton incident also gave us inspiration! So we will, at an appropriate time—not now, at an appropriate time—launch standardized cotton futures and cotton yarn futures, to provide the highest standard financial derivative services for manufacturers and investors while enjoying the highest level of investor protection. This is also actively responding to the administration's call for finance to genuinely serve the real economy."

"Good, I will speak to here. Below, please journalists ask questions in an orderly manner."

As soon as he finished, a bespectacled young man standing in front immediately raised his hand. Ren nodded; the young cadre passed the amplifier to him.

"Chief Ren, hello. I am a *Yangcheng Express* reporter. May I ask what specific regulatory measures the Senate has for the futures about to be listed? When will contract information be announced? Thank you!"

"Very good question. However, 'about to be listed' doesn't quite apply yet. After all, one can't eat oneself fat in one bite. Conditions in this area aren't mature yet; long-term investigation and preliminary preparation are needed. So we will launch a simplified model of 'Prepayment Forward Contract,' with controllable risk. At the same time, we will promulgate corresponding Futures Trading Management Regulations; later, depending on circumstances, it may be upgraded to law. For the draft regulations, we will also publish a version soliciting opinions; at that time, we will fully solicit opinions from the broadest market participants. Contract information will also solicit everyone's opinions. What I can reveal here is: referencing Great Song's mature derivative trading experience, combined with local actual conditions, it should both guarantee market liquidity and meet commodity delivery requirements. Good, next."

An elegant young woman raised her hand. Ren happily directed the young cadre to let her speak.

"Dear Chief, hello! I am *Readers' Friend* reporter Xue Xiao. Very happy to meet you again today. I feel very honored! I would like to know, what specific aspects does the highest level of investor protection you mentioned embody?"

"Ah... um..."

Everyone barely suppressed their surprise, waiting for Chief Ren, whose eyes had rolled to the heavens, to respond.

"The situation is like this. First, we will levy a certain proportion of Investor Protection Fund on each transaction. This clause is already in effect for securities trading. Considering derivatives are new things with relatively high risk, initially we will collect a slightly higher proportion—this is also a way to suppress excessive speculation. Second, we will also strictly manage investor access, requiring qualified investors with certain experience and risk-bearing capacity to conduct trading. Third, we will strengthen investor education, deeply implanting concepts like 'Investment has risk, trading requires caution, buyer beware' in everyone's hearts. Mm."

"Thank you very much, Chief, for exchanging with us despite your busy schedule."

"Next."

...Honestly speaking, such press conferences and Q&A had somewhat performative nature, mainly to let indigenous people comprehend and understand the form of "press conferences," gradually becoming accustomed to obtaining authoritative Senate information through press conferences. However, this round of Q&A wasn't scripted beforehand; Senator Ren had some room for free improvisation.

The gentry and wealthy households actually didn't quite understand what he had said. But they had more or less heard of the Paper Cotton matter. Yet different from what the Senators estimated, almost no gentry or wealthy household got involved. Rather, it was housekeepers, servants, accountants, and such underlings, plus concubines and the like from their families who were tangled up in it. For the wealthy families, buying and selling on speculation was still too bold for them.

Looking at it, the Senate wasn't averse to this kind of trading; the words seemed even encouraging. But this was no surprise—who didn't know Australians valued money most?
