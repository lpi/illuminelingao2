# Chapter 2672: The Capital (Part 24)

As for what the Teacher's supernatural power actually was, Zhou Lezhi only learned later. But at that time, these rumors only added another layer of mystery to Mr. Zhou.

He had been by Mr. Zhou's side for several months, and both Mr. Zhou and Wang Yehao trusted him very much. Gradually, the two stopped sending him away during conversations but kept him by their side. Wang Liang said this was "confidant" treatment.

Considering his identity as Mr. Zhou's "disciple," this treatment wasn't excessive. According to the rules, the teacher-disciple relationship was comparable to father and son. However, Zhou Lezhi could clearly feel these days that the Teacher didn't completely trust him. He had a vague defensiveness, not only against him but also against Master Wang and others in the Wang residence.

There was a desolate sense of loneliness about the Teacher. Although, in Zhou Lezhi's view, his life was superior enough, and his future was bright. With Master Wang's current ability, even if Zhou Lezhi wanted to be a minor official, it probably wouldn't be a problem.

Probably people with high attainment were all a bit eccentric.

Eccentric or mysterious, Zhou Lezhi still had quite a good impression of this Teacher. First, he treated him genuinely well, doing his best when teaching studies and answering every question; sometimes when seeing he didn't quite understand, he would add extra tutoring, insisting on crushing the knowledge to explain it clearly. Second, he didn't have the hobby of superiors trampling on people. Mr. Zhou was polite to everyone, never made unreasonable demands, and never used his status to oppress or abuse servants and disciples. Just for this point, Zhou Lezhi felt he was a rare gentleman.

Originally, he felt somewhat guilty about his identity as an "undercover agent," but since discovering that Mr. Zhou was open and aboveboard, with no shameful secrets other than some "widower's illness" [lust], he felt that being an undercover agent was actually the same as not being one, so he gradually felt at ease.

The days in Shaoxing were not short, and Mr. Zhou didn't stay idle. He traveled around visiting mountains and waters. Every time he saw people's livelihood withering and commoners suffering, he would always reveal a look of unbearable pity. But he never said anything. During this period, he strolled in the markets, observing the livelihoods of shops and various craftsmen with great curiosity. After returning, he would write notes in his "vernacular."

Because Mr. Zhou's handwriting was really ugly, his notes were routinely copied by Zhou Lezhi in small regular script. Otherwise, even he himself couldn't stand looking at them.

As for the content of the notes, it could be called diverse. Urban conditions, rural phenomena, commercial forms, craftsmanship techniques, daily life of commoners, price trends, local customs... everything was included. Zhou Lezhi couldn't understand what the Teacher was doing this for.

He couldn't help asking Mr. Zhou, but Mr. Zhou answered, "I'm thinking about how to make money."

Zhou Lezhi didn't understand how to make money, so he had to shut up. Unexpectedly, Mr. Zhou asked him, "What money do you think is easiest to warn in this world?"

"Being an official!"

"That doesn't count." Mr. Zhou shook his head helplessly. "Officials getting money, that's not doing business; it's stealing the marrow and blood of commoners. If you say that, can't bandits also get big money? I mean serious business, not illegal dealings."

"Then it goes without saying, Teacher's Divine Medicine!" Zhou Lezhi particularly admired the Teacher's medicine that "worked with one dose." No matter what famous doctor, they all talked about "illness going away like spinning silk," drinking bowls of medicinal soup for a month or two, often ending with both money and person gone. Only this Mr. Zhou's medicine produced instant results upon taking.

Mr. Zhou showed a somewhat guilty smile and said, "Although medicine is good, getting sick is always a troublesome thing. Besides, opening a pharmacy can't hope for booming business. What else?"

"Overseas trade." Zhou Lezhi said, "In our Guangdong, there are the most people going overseas for trade. With a small capital of twenty or thirty taels, whether going to the Eastern Ocean or the Western Ocean, as long as one can return safely, one trip out brings profit, and the return trip brings another profit. Making double profit back and forth is extremely easy. If luck is good, three or five times profit is possible. It's just..."

"Just what?"

"Bad luck. Capsizing or encountering pirates. Coming back with a life is already the best luck. How many people go and never return."

"The risk is too great; let's not discuss it for now. What else?"

"Still more?" Zhou Lezhi thought, *Is the Teacher testing me?* Speaking of which, Mr. Zhou often lectured on "economics" on ordinary days. He thought for a moment and said, "Then there is opening a bank or pawnshop. Taking deposits at low interest and lending at high interest, sitting and collecting interest. Money rolling in..."

"Hehe, you are right. Finance is indeed the fastest way to get money." Mr. Zhou couldn't help clapping and laughing. "But this line requires big capital and a big threshold [backer] to support it."

Zhou Lezhi said, "If the Teacher wants to do this business, isn't Master Wang a ready-made big threshold?"

The Teacher smiled but didn't answer, continuing, "What if we can't do a bank either?"

"Then... then be a rice merchant!"

"Rice merchant?"

"Yes. In this world, as long as one is human, one must eat to live. Being a rice merchant, isn't it a sure profit without loss?"

Mr. Zhou laughed loudly and said, "Well said. En, being a rice merchant is indeed not bad. However, rice merchants are just middlemen transporting goods, seeking profit from capital. They don't grow rice themselves. If natural or man-made disasters occur and there is no rice to trade, they can only stare blankly too."

"What does the Teacher think makes money?" Zhou Lezhi's curiosity was piqued by him.

"If it were me, it would be opening a factory to make objects that everyone needs and are very cheap."

"Why doesn't the Teacher make the Divine Medicine?"

For an instant, Mr. Zhou's eyes flickered, and he said somewhat hastily, "Divine Medicine... can't count. After all, it's Divine Medicine; there are too many prerequisites... Just given the raw materials... en, en, can't gather them..."

Then he immediately changed the subject: "Actually, there are many things that everyone uses and are very cheap. For example, soap... right, you call it *Yizi*; and matches, easier to use than flint and steel..."

That day, the Master enthusiastically talked about many useful little things. Zhou Lezhi had never heard of any of them. Hearing the Teacher describe them so well, his heart itched, and he said, "Teacher, since the things are so good, how about letting Master Wang put up money to set up a factory? You and Master Wang can both earn money."

"Ai, ai, ai, you think I don't want to. but making these things sounds easy, but it's actually hard. A thousand threads and ten thousand clues; no way to start..."

In the evening, Zhou Lezhi reported this conversation between him and the Teacher to Wang Liang. Unexpectedly, the next day, he was called over by Master Wang. He repeated the words again. Wang Yehao twisted his beard for half a day before saying, "Does he really have plans to engage in business and make money?"

"It looked like a joke, but seemed not to be," Zhou Lezhi said cautiously.

"If he really has this intention, just go along with him."

Zhou Lezhi thought, *This Master Wang is also quite enthusiastic about making money.*

Wang Yehao stayed in Shaoxing for quite a few days. He managed household affairs, visited local officials and local gentry. Incidentally, he also helped the Teacher register his household registration—only then did Zhou Lezhi know that the Teacher was still an undocumented person.

Matters finished, Master Wang set off back to the capital. In addition to much more luggage, there was an extra depressed-looking scholar about forty years old in the team. This person's identity was somewhat strange; he was actually a prisoner.

When did official masters transport prisoners as a side task? Zhou Lezhi felt quite strange. But it wasn't convenient to ask more, so he just set off with the team.

The group traveled by boat or sedan chair all the way to Hangzhou. Only then did they board the boat at the Rice Market Wharf four *li* outside the Wulin Gate north of the city. Wang Yehao's grand-uncle Wang Chengxun had been the Grand Governor of Canal Transport for more than twenty years and was the last Grain Transport Commander-in-Chief of the Ming Dynasty. This time, on one hand, they were transporting the "Contribution" for the Nine Thousand Years [Wei Zhongxian]; on the other hand, he was a relative of the old superior, and they wanted to repay the grace of promotion back then, so the Grain Transport Troops in Hangzhou were particularly dedicated, specially arranging four large official boats. One for Wang Yehao and his close followers, one carrying attendants and guards, two carrying various wealth and goods, and two small boats following as backups.

Boarding the official boat on the Grand Canal, the journey afterwards was quite pleasant. The Teacher combined what they saw and heard on the journey to comment and explain. After this trip, Zhou Lezhi felt his horizons greatly expanded. The Teacher taught almost many methods of thinking and observation. Many people and things he couldn't understand in the past, savoring them again in retrospect now, gave him a feeling of the clouds parting to see the sun, suddenly becoming enlightened.

The Teacher said that learning is not just mastering knowledge, but more about learning to think on the basis of mastering knowledge.

Now he understood somewhat.

One night, the boat rested at Guazhou Ferry. Master Wang suddenly came to Mr. Zhou's cabin, smiling all over his face and holding the latest Capital Gazette retrieved from the post station.

"That Construction Slave [Manchu] indeed set a siege at Jinzhou. The Teacher's calculation is wonderful; truly a divine man."

"Haha, actually there's no need to rush this time. Wait until summer when it gets too hot, they will withdraw." Mr. Zhou looked quite proud.

Through the studies of recent months, Zhou Lezhi already had a basic understanding of the situation under heaven and knew the two were talking about the war in Liaodong. But these words were headless and tailless, baffling. He didn't know what exactly the two were talking about, only knowing it must be major military and state affairs, so he just stood respectfully to the side to serve.

"That is good." Let alone withdrawing troops, even if he said now that the Manchus would fight directly to the capital city, Wang Yehao wouldn't dare not believe. "Teacher, traveling all this way, are the two maids still suitable?"

"Make do. It's just not very convenient on the boat."

Zhou Lezhi laughed secretly. Although a single room was specially allocated for the Teacher, the cabin was really narrow and inconvenient for "human relations." The Teacher seemed somewhat frustrated [fire rising].

"In a few days, we will arrive at Yangzhou Prefecture. Since ancient times, Yangzhou's romantic affairs have crowned the world. I wonder if the Teacher has interest?" Wang Yehao felt that literati had literati's rhetoric, and rough stocks had rough stocks' slang. There was absolutely no need to beat around the bush when chatting with Mr. Zhou; it was better to be straightforward.

"Yes! The Master is really a true friend!" The Teacher was quite cooperative.

"Hehe, it is rare that the Teacher has such elegant interest. This official has also long heard the beautiful name of Yangzhou Thin Horses. At that time, I will definitely tour with the Teacher."

But the Teacher asked a question that left Wang Yehao unsure how to answer: "Master, are there Fat Horses?"
