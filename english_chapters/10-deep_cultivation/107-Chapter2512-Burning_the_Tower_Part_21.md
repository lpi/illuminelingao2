# Chapter 2512: Burning the Tower (21)

The sky was getting late, approaching the hour of *You* (5-7 PM). A burst of rapid horse hoofbeats came from the official road. Eleven riders pressed their bodies tightly against the horses' backs, speeding past like a gale. The dense trees and mottled rocks by the road flashed by, retreating quickly backward. Wei Mingchen estimated the mileage in his heart and slowly tightened the reins. With a gesture of raising his arm high and pressing down, the speed of the riding team gradually decreased. Wei Mingchen's group carefully observed the river channel near the official road, looking for the boat carrying Li Jian and his nephew. Yun Ting's order to him was simple: no matter who they were, kill them and cut off all of Xue Tu's thoughts.

After walking a little further, Wei Mingchen saw a small boat. The small boat also had secret marks painted on it—this was exactly the skiff used to transport the meeting participants. Wei Mingchen reined in his horse not far from the small boat, swung his leg, jumped down lightly from the horse, and said in a deep voice, "Dismount. Watch out. Everyone keep your eyes bright."

Ten riders dismounted one after another, drawing Qi Family sabers or Japanese swords from their waists. Several others took out hand crossbows from their satchels. Six of them quickly formed a circular defensive formation facing outward, while the other four divided into two groups to occupy both sides of the road. Wei Mingchen carefully approached the skiff. The boatman had already died on the river beach, half his body soaking in the water.

Wei Mingchen first walked to the boatman's corpse to examine it. The wounds were all on the back, representing a merciless pursuit. The fatal wound came from concentrated stabbing in the kidneys. There was also a puncture wound on the side of the neck. The wound surface was large, caused by violently shaking the short knife after insertion to expand the wound. This should have been a follow-up stab after stabbing the kidneys.

Lying on the sandy beach was another boatman. These two were both Xue Tu's subordinates and had also been bought by him long ago. When they came out, they did not row to the predetermined location but grounded at this desolate place on the water channel, facilitating their galloping catch-up.

Although this place was by the official road, passersby were extremely scarce. Even if there were a few passersby, they could be easily silenced.

Wei Mingchen sucked in a breath of cold air lightly. He turned his gaze to the small boat, held his single saber horizontally in front of him, and moved slowly toward the cabin inch by inch, fully alert. Just approaching the boat awning, he smelled a pungent bloody smell. A sound of *tick-tock* came from under the boat awning. Blood seeping from the gaps in the boat bottom planks dripped slowly and rhythmically. This made Wei Mingchen feel somewhat uncomfortable. He frowned and gently lifted the curtain of the boat awning with the single-handed cloud ladder saber in his hand.

Inside the small boat lay the corpse of a big man in black clothes. His hollow, lifeless eyes were wide open, seeming to look at Wei Mingchen. This made Wei Mingchen's heart skip a beat. HE calmed his emotions and carefully examined the situation inside the boat.

Blood, blood everywhere. The big man had multiple puncture wounds in the jugular vein area below the Adam's apple, a cut on the femoral artery of the leg, and a slash on the left side of the neck. This knife cut open the carotid artery, causing massive bleeding. The big man's blood pressure sprayed fresh blood everywhere like a spring. Every knife wound was fatal. This led the big man to death within a few seconds. The viscous blood had not completely dried yet, slowly creeping downward under the guidance of gravity, making one feel nauseous. Wei Mingchen looked around the cabin. Two knife marks were engraved on the cabin wall panels and frame. The cuts were fresh, likely left during the fight.

This Li Jian was indeed a trained expert. In such a narrow space, fighting alone, he killed three people instantly. Although the two boatmen couldn't be said to have much kung fu, they were also fierce and combative men, not that easy to deal with.

Wei Mingchen shifted his gaze outside the boat and examined carefully nearby. There were no footprints around, but the color of the sand on one layer of the ground appeared too uniform. Wei Mingchen walked over and brushed it gently with his hand, revealing a few dark black dried blood spots under the sand grains. He crouched down and identified carefully. The uniform floating dust was caused by Li Jian using branches to scribble over and clean up the remaining traces when retreating. The blood spots represented that at least one of them was injured. Wei Mingchen walked to the east roadside along the direction of the traces. Li Jian and the other did not continue along the official road but chose to enter the reed marshes by the road. They might choose to hide and wait for the pursuers to withdraw on their own, or they might be waiting for follow-up support.

He looked around and found a few broken branches. The broken surfaces were very new. The weeds underground had obvious traces of being trampled. Walking further forward, he found a few footprints in a relatively flat mud patch. Wei Mingchen estimated roughly. Judging from the footprint density and spacing, there were only two people. This meant no one was meeting them. One of the footprints was deeper and had drag marks on the ground, indicating that one person carried a heavier load. That was caused by dragging a wounded person.

Wei Mingchen breathed a sigh of relief. As long as people move in nature, they inevitably leave traces. Carrying a wounded person, they wouldn't get far.

He waved his hand, and the ten people around immediately gathered. Wei Mingchen said coldly, "Leave one horse stake (person to watch horses). Others follow me to chase. If you encounter danger, communicate with bamboo whistles. Do not use bamboo whistles unless it is a critical matter; that will reveal our location." Everyone nodded individually. Several dark shadows flashed and disappeared into the dense forest on the hillside.

Xu Tong squatted on the ground panting violently. He needed to recover some physical strength. Li Baiqing sat not far from him, appearing extremely weak. This half-old man's abdomen was wrapped with torn clothes. Blood seeped out continuously, dyeing the clothes binding the wound red. The moment the small boat suddenly grounded, Xu Tong knew he wouldn't get away easily today. He tore open the stitching at the cross-collar, where a short, refined steel knuckle duster was hidden. He anticipated that the other party would make a move, but what surprised him was that the other party actually took the initiative to launch an attack despite not having numerical superiority. The man escorting the boat probably hoped to solve one opponent first, then join hands with the boatmen to finish off the remaining one. Li Baiqing's seat was at the boat awning entrance, bearing the brunt of the first knife. Immediately, Xu Tong blocked the big man's knife-holding right hand with his left hand, used his right arm elbow to pry open the opponent's left hand, and immediately followed with the knuckle duster stabbing fiercely at the big man's jugular vein. The short knuckle duster could not hack or chop, only stab and scratch, but inside the narrow boat awning where one could almost only bend arms and coil elbows, it was more agile than the big man's short knife. It only needed a few centimeters of space to perform repeated concentrated stabbing. Massive bleeding from the jugular vein and carotid artery instantly deprived the big man of the power to resist. The fatal blow ended in an instant, leaving only a mess.

Li Baiqing was not seriously injured. Xu Tong pressed the bleeding point on his abdomen and performed simple bandaging for him. The two avoided the official road and quickly hid in the reed marshes. Xu Tong checked Li Baiqing's injury again. A laceration. Not very heavy, and the injury didn't seem to worsen, but rapid walking would pull the abdominal wound open, significantly slowing down walking speed. This was a fatal problem. Xu Tong took off his coat, tore it open with the short knife, and took out the 1:5000 map, compass, and tape measure from the interlayer. Comparing with the records on his way here, he estimated his position and direction. But obviously his mental arithmetic ability wasn't very good; after a brief calculation, he only figured out the correct direction. Xu Tong felt some annoyance and frustration, but he didn't have much time to waste. He didn't know if there were follow-up pursuers, but he had to consider the worst possibility. He pulled out the water bag stopper, took a sip, and handed it to Li Baiqing. After Li Baiqing finished drinking, Xu Tong took the short knife and cut open the bottom of the water bladder with one slice, but no water flowed out. This specially made water bladder was composed of two independent storage spaces inside, one for water and one for storing sundries.

Xu Tong took out three small bamboo tubes from the storage bag. The two small ones were larger than paper-wrapped cartridges, and the large one was only about the thickness of a thumb and index finger circle. Xu Tong tucked the three bamboo tubes into his bosom, stood up, looked at Li Baiqing, and asked, "Still okay?" Li Baiqing forced a smile and said, "Still okay." Xu Tong nodded and said, "You go first." Li Baiqing glanced at him, didn't speak, stood up leaning on a tree branch, and walked slowly forward.

Carrying a "colorful number" (wounded), it was difficult to disengage quickly. Whether out of work, morality, or otherwise, he could not abandon Li Baiqing. He was not an elite covert warrior trained by the Senate, ready to sacrifice his life for the mission at any time. He was not just one person; he also represented the entire Old Li Village and the Lower Six Villages Mutual Defense.

Once he died in the mission, the Senate's influence in the entire Six Lower Villages would suffer a blow. This was very unfavorable for the current situation.

But taking him along made it difficult to hide tracks. If there were pursuers, they would inevitably follow the traces. He needed to confirm if pursuers existed. Xu Tong stood up looking for a suitable position. He deliberately stepped on and broke a few vines and wild grasses, leaving some walking traces. Then he dug a shallow pit with his short knife on a wild path only passable for one person, and buried a small bamboo tube vertically into it. Most of the bamboo tube was buried in the soil, with only a small section exposed outside. Then he gently covered it with floating soil and a few fallen leaves. He looked left and right, seeing no flaws, before standing up satisfied. Must depart. Xu Tong looked up at the sky and thought, *definitely have to spend the night in the wild today.*

Wei Mingchen walked quickly. There were two people scouting ahead of him, and seven people following closely one after another behind him, like a long centipede. Wei Mingchen felt he was getting closer and closer to the prey. The desire for bloodlust made him somewhat excited.

The lead swordsman used his sword to constantly beat and chop the weeds around him. His attention was completely focused on the front. Suddenly, he felt his foot being jammed by something, seeming to have stepped on a small stone. The bamboo tube stepped on by the swordsman sank downward. The enhanced black powder cartridge loaded inside the bamboo tube pressed down along with the swordsman's weight. The brass spacer used to separate the propellant from the percussion cap continued to press the percussion cap below, pressing the cap fiercely onto the convex platform at the bottom of the bamboo tube. To ensure the firing rate of this small booby trap, the percussion cap used was more sensitive than gun caps, kept separate normally and only loaded by unscrewing the tube bottom when used.
