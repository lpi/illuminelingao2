# Chapter 2753: The Capital (Part 105)

The "Young Master" is too young, only thirteen years old this year. "When the master is young, the state is suspect"; most people with talent and strength are unwilling to blindly attach themselves. Even with the "Young Master's" legitimacy, the vast majority of Zheng Zhilong's old subordinates have flowed to other factions. To date, the Zheng Sen group gathered in Anping has only two thousand troops on water and land, and thirty ships of various sizes. They can barely protect themselves. Various forces coveting the land and manors near Anping constantly use threats and inducements, wanting to "support the Young Master." Qian Taichong has been stretched thin, maneuvering back and forth, barely maintaining the small situation.

Under such pressure, Qian Taichong knew that even if he were Zhuge Liang, he could not display his skills in this tiny Zhangzhou Bay. To break the deadlock and survive, he had to find a bigger backer.

Originally, the Fujian Governor was his biggest backer. But since Zou Weilian left office, the new Governor, Shen Youlong, has been very cold towards the Zheng clique. Although he treats them with courtesy on the surface, his attitude towards the various struggles within the clique is completely one of "sitting on the mountain to watch the tigers fight." Qian Taichong rushed to Fuzhou several times but failed to obtain any substantial assistance.

Fortunately, Shen Youlong's attitude towards the Zheng clique is still divide and rule. Although he will not help any specific family, he will not allow them to annex each other either. But what about his successor? If someone receives heavy bribes, or if that person intends to reorganize the Zheng family, the Zheng Sen group will be in imminent danger.

After considering it again and again, Qian Taichong decided to take a big gamble and come directly to the Capital to find a backer.

He entered the Capital in the ninth year of Chongzhen and stayed until the New Year. During this period, he searched for various channels and went through various backdoors in the Capital. It must be said that the network of favors left by Zheng Zhilong was indeed quite extensive. Relying on Zheng Sen's reputation, Qian Taichong met several big shots in the court, and even met Cao Huachun, the "Inner Prime Minister." He met many high-ranking officials of Fujian origin. He spent tens of thousands of taels before and after, but never received a useful reply.

In this half-year in the Capital, he genuinely experienced what "when the person leaves, the tea cools" means. When Zheng Zhilong was in power, he had never enjoyed his glory, but running around for Zheng Sen made him fully experience the fickleness of human relationships.

If it were anyone else, they would probably have been disheartened long ago. But Qian Taichong had a stubborn temper and insisted on doing what others could not. In despair, he decided to personally write a memorial to the Emperor. However, his rank was lowly and his position small, so he had no right to present a memorial directly. He could only entrust it to court officials.

But this person was not easy to find. When Zheng Zhilong was alive, the Fujianese officials in the court shared much of the profit from the maritime trade he managed. After Zheng Zhilong died, the various small groups split from the Zheng clique were excluded from maritime trade by the Kun scoundrels.

Without a connection of interest, these people naturally would not stick their necks out for Zheng Sen. Qian Taichong finally took the eunuch's route, hoping for a last fight. For this cup of tea, including various messy expenses in between, he used one thousand taels of silver.

Unexpectedly, this "last fight" worked! Qian Taichong was taken to the Jinyiwei yamen and detained for a few days, and was questioned several times. Today, he was suddenly brought out and told to wear his official uniform and prepare relevant documents.

When asked where he was going, the other party kept their mouth shut. However, their behavior and conversation were much more polite than in previous days.

Qian Taichong had a faint answer in his heart, but he dared not believe it—an audience in the Golden Hall; this is the dream of every scholar who studied hard by the cold window. Even at this moment here and now, he still felt as if he were in a dream.

As the eunuch before the Imperial presence came out to summon him, Qian Taichong hurriedly straightened his clothes and hat, bent his waist, and followed the eunuch into the Yufang Pavilion step by step.

A palace maid lifted the yellow satin door curtain. Qian Taichong bent his back almost ninety degrees and walked respectfully into the East Warm Chamber.

He said: "Subject Qian Taichong, Inspector of the Zhangzhou Coastal Defense Sub-prefect's Yamen, greets the Imperial Majesty!" He immediately knelt down and kowtowed to the Emperor.

For such a private audience, officials usually didn't report their full titles, but Qian Taichong thought that since he was not a close minister of the Son of Heaven, it was better to report his full official title so that the Emperor could be left with an impression.

It was a rare fortune for someone of his status to see the Emperor, but to actually face the Imperial Countenance, he inevitably felt uneasy in his heart. He was no longer a "commoner," but with a lowly rank and small position, writing a memorial to discuss affairs was truly a great taboo. Obtaining an audience roughly indicated that the Emperor was interested in his memorial, but since ancient times "accompanying a ruler is like accompanying a tiger." If there were any omissions in his reply, his personal safety was trivial, but it also concerned Zheng Sen and a group of loyal and righteous people around him.

After performing the customary court etiquette, he dared not lift his head, looking at the square brick floor in front of the Emperor's feet, waiting for the Emperor to speak.

For a moment, Chongzhen did not speak, only looking the visitor up and down. He saw that the man was over thirty, with a steady expression, dark skin, and very large hands and feet. Although his manners were slightly rough, judging by his face, he was a very reliable person.

"You are Qian Taichong?"

"Yes, it is precisely this humble subject."

"Which year is your examination fame from?"

"Your subject is ashamed. I wasted time in the examination field and only achieved the rank of licentiate (*xiucai*). I paid a contribution to become a student of the Nanjing Imperial College. In the fifth year of Chongzhen, I was appointed as an Inspector for being on the merit roll for the recovery of Anping and Zhongzuo."

"You don't need to be ashamed that you didn't come from the standard path. There are many talents in the world; how can every one of them be from the civil service examinations?"

"I thank the Emperor for the encouragement." Hearing this sentence, Qian Taichong only felt a sourness in his chest and a surge of blood. Just a polite remark, but coming from the mouth of the Son of Heaven, it held supreme glory.

"Rise and reply."

Qian Taichong kowtowed once, hurriedly stood up, and lowered his head waiting for the Emperor to continue speaking.

Looking from the corner of his eye, he saw a young man sitting on the throne in the middle, wearing a black gauze folded-corner cap, a bright red round-collar narrow-sleeved robe with four coiled dragons, and a translucent rhinoceros horn belt at his waist. In appearance, he would not be over thirty, but his complexion was very poor, and his eyes were listless. His whole body radiated a sense of exhaustion.

The Emperor coughed lightly and said:

"You have been in the Capital for many days, running around for Zheng Sen. Zhen has also seen your memorial."

"Yes."

"Your utter devotion to General Feihuang (Zheng Zhilong) moves even Zhen. It is truly the Zheng family's fortune that he could employ a person like you!"

This sentence drew out Qian Taichong's bellyful of melancholy. For these past few years, he had run around for Zheng Sen, racking his brains. Yet there were few people in the Zheng clique who spoke well of him. Not to mention outsiders, even the people around Zheng Sen respected him on the surface, but behind his back, they questioned whether his hard work was intended to sideline Zheng Sen and earn the Zheng family's remaining wealth.

He could only pour out this grievance to the two foreigners, Tong Taro and Matos—of course, it was precisely by relying on them that he could continue to give orders by Zheng Sen's side.

At this moment, it seemed his toil and grievances were rewarded. Just as he wanted to speak, he felt a lump in his throat. Fearing a breach of etiquette, he hurriedly calmed his mood before speaking:

"Your subject dares not speak of 'loyalty' to General Feihuang, only that having received a trust, I dare not slacken in the slightest. Now Zheng Sen has not yet reached the age of twenty. Although he has inherited the hereditary post, he has no power in his hands. The Zheng family, high and low, mostly do not accept his dispatch. Even the land and money left by his father have mostly been seized by relatives. The General was harmed by the Kun scoundrels and died loyal to the country. His legitimate son has fallen into such a state. Your subject implies lowly and powerless to support him, so I can only come to the Capital to do my best to run around for him."

Chongzhen had already read what he said in the memorial and didn't have much feeling about it. Zheng Zhilong was also one of the "giant bandits" who gave him headaches back then. Later, although Xiong Wencan pacified him and he also quelled many sea pirates and local bandits in Fujian and Guangdong, many ministers mentioned in secret memorials that this person was "arrogant and absurd," "colluded with Japanese pirates," and had the air of "listening to transfers but not to proclamations."

When the Zheng Zhilong group was crushed by the Kun scoundrels, many ministers in the court thought this was "two thieves fighting each other," which couldn't be better. Some even thought that from then on, "there would be no more giant bandits on the Fujian and Guangdong seas"!

These emotions more or less influenced the Emperor's judgment. He summoned Qian Taichong not to uphold justice for Zheng Sen.

"Did you go to see Shen Youlong about this matter?"

"I met him, only... it was of no help."

"What did he say?"

"Lord Shen said that although Zheng Sen has inherited the hereditary post, the Zheng family's affairs are private matters, and it is inconvenient for him to intervene." Qian Taichong said with some difficulty, "This humble subject also knows that the Lord's words are reasonable, only this... bullying orphans and widows..."

Chongzhen nodded slightly. He had a good impression of Qian Taichong before him. He felt that to repay a bit of gratitude for recognition, this man shouted and ran around for the orphan of his benefactor, and even thought of finding a way to the Capital to present a memorial, fighting the lawsuit all the way to him.

Such a person was not only "loyal" but also had a tenacity in doing things. It was just a pity he was only a *xiucai*; his specific learning was unknown.

"I read your memorial; you know much about the Kun situation?"

"Yes. This student was once a private secretary to Shi Bangyao, the Administration Vice Commissioner of Guangdong and Intendant of Hainan Circuit. In the third year of Chongzhen, when Governor Wang sent troops to punish the Kun scoundrels, this student accompanied the army on the expedition. The King's army was defeated at Chengmai, and this student was captured by the Kun scoundrels in the chaotic army. It was not until the fifth year of Chongzhen that I escaped and returned."

"You followed Wang Zunde on the expedition against the Kun scoundrels?" The Emperor was greatly surprised; he didn't expect this *xiucai* to have this past.

"Yes. This humble subject was sent by Lord Shi to follow Governor Wang from Qiongzhou City until the defeat under Chengmai City," Qian Taichong said with no small amount of sorrow.

"No wonder you know so much about the Kun situation." The Emperor thought. Since Wang Zunde's defeat, many people had submitted memorials discussing the Kun scoundrels and Kun affairs, but most scratched the surface. Even though there were many Kun goods in the Capital and even in the palace, from beginning to end, very few people understood the Kun situation. Now that the Kun scoundrels had already taken two provinces, his side actually knew nothing about the internal situation of the Kun scoundrels!

This person had fought the Kun scoundrels twice and was trapped among the thieves for several years. He must be very clear about the Kun situation; he was a talent urgently needed right now!

He asked: "Since you know much about the Kun situation, let Zhen ask you..."

At that moment, he asked about all kinds of so-called Kun situations circulating in the court one by one. Qian Taichong had worked hard labor under the Senate for two solid years, unlike ordinary scholars who relied on hearsay and sought novelty. He explained them one by one immediately, dismissing some rumors as absurd and explaining the "reason why" for others.
