# Chapter 2583 - Investigation (Part 6)

"...I'll disguise myself as a small merchant or traveling doctor and set off for Huizhou alone. After arriving in Huizhou, I'll contact the Chief."

"You've thought it through thoroughly." Zheng Mingjiang nodded approvingly. "Alright, once you reach Huizhou, contact me through Qiwei's inn."

"I understand. I will definitely not fail my mission!"

After settling the relevant contact plan, Zheng Mingjiang specially allocated a sum of money to him as expenses. Yuan Shuzhi took his leave.

Yuan Shuzhi returned to his lodging at the Wansheng Teahouse. Though he'd passed the civil service examination, he had no family or friends, nowhere to go. Though people had tried to match him with a wife, to start a new family, Yuan Shuzhi had declined with a smile each time.

"I'm over fifty—what would I marry for? If I had a baby, wouldn't I just burden my wife and make the child suffer?"

Now he and Zeng Juan's family had become as close as kin. As a lodger, his meals and laundry were all taken care of by Mother Zeng. In the past, he'd felt some guilt about "freeloading." Now that he had a salary, he gave Mother Zeng one yuan each month for rent and food. The rest he saved.

In the past when he returned, he'd always banter a bit with Mingnu, the old and the young joking around before going about his business. This time he went straight to his room upon returning, saying he had a work trip to another region these next few days and needed to carefully organize some documents, asking everyone not to disturb him. Nobody found this unusual.

Yuan Shuzhi returned to his room but knew this mission was quite dangerous. The Chief's miracle medicines were treasures one in ten thousand—a single "course" of medicine cost dozens of yuan. Now someone had dared to tempt fate by stealing "miracle drugs" for profit. Anyone who dared do this was no ordinary person—certainly a desperate outlaw who feared nothing. If he was the slightest bit careless, his life might be forfeit.

Building achievements was certainly important, but losing one's life meant losing everything. Though Yuan Shuzhi had spoken passionately and sincerely when facing the Elder, upon reflection afterward, preserving his life to witness the Senate's glory was most important.

Thinking this way, he needed to do some preparation work first. Yuan Shuzhi had never been to Huizhou, but he'd encountered many Huizhou people and knew it was Hakka territory. His Cantonese accent would mark him as an outsider the moment he opened his mouth. Pretending to be a local wouldn't work—he could only dress as a merchant.

But he had a clear perception of himself: he really didn't look like a merchant. Whether the monks who'd taken him in originally, the teahouse patrons, or later his colleagues at the Comprehensive Governance Bureau, everyone used "pedantic scholar" as his nickname.

---

Traveling doctors with bells—given his temperament, the role wasn't far off. He'd also read some medical books in the past; mumbling some medical theory, taking a pulse, and writing a prescription was passable. But bell-ringing doctors were jianghu people who needed to know the secret argot to travel freely. Otherwise, anyone checking his credentials would expose him.

This meant he was most suited to pretend to be a failed examination candidate or impoverished old licentiate. With this thought, he got up and took out several old scholar's robes and such from his trunk—clothes he hadn't worn since passing the civil service examination. But Mother Zeng had washed them clean, mended them, and put them away.

He no longer had a hair bun, but this didn't matter. Many people in Guangzhou had already cut off their hair buns and gotten the Baldy haircut. After all, this was the hairstyle of Elders and cadres. So having short hair was no problem—no need for fake buns or anything.

Being a failed candidate or old licentiate, with such a poor scholar's look, without good reason one wouldn't casually travel hundreds of li. He had no relatives or friends in Huizhou, couldn't claim to be visiting family, and if he said he was going to teach at a private school, being asked specifically which family would leave him with nothing to say.

After much thought, he remembered that Wansheng Teahouse had an assistant from Huizhou whose family also ran a teahouse. He discussed with Zeng Juan, having him get the assistant to write a letter of introduction with the header and name left blank.

After Zeng Juan prepared the letter of introduction and gave it to Yuan Shuzhi, watching him fill in the name, he couldn't help but ask curiously:

"What's this about?"

"Ah Juan, did you forget Civil Service Discipline Article 18, Section 3, Point 1? Don't ask about things you shouldn't ask about." Yuan Shuzhi was very serious.

"I know, I know." Zeng Juan quickly said. "I won't ask."

"I'm going on a work trip this time, on a secret mission. You need to keep it confidential." Yuan Shuzhi thought about shouldering an important responsibility, his expression quite solemn.

"Understood. Take care of yourself too." Zeng Juan reminded. "Whatever happens, preserve your life first!"

"Ah Juan, I'll remember."

The next day after breakfast, Yuan Shuzhi came to Tianzi Dock. There were many passenger boats to Huizhou—both the flower-tail barges run by newly-established shipping companies and old-style individual boats.

Yuan Shuzhi chose an old-style boat because riding a flower-tail barge didn't fit his current identity. After all, even second-class cabin passengers were at least small merchants.

He negotiated a price with the boatman, then carried his bedroll aboard and sat down. Such boats mostly mixed passengers and cargo—roughly speaking, the bottom was filled with cargo and passengers sat on top of the cargo. There were no luxury cabins, and meals and bedding weren't provided on the journey—passengers brought everything themselves. Short trips were tolerable; long journeys were very difficult. The only advantage was the low price, and passengers were mostly common folk.

Yuan Shuzhi boarded early and claimed a spot near the boat's stern by the canopy exit. This spot had good ventilation and lighting—as long as it didn't rain, it was the best seat. He spread his bedroll on deck, sat with his back against the canopy, and waited quietly for departure.

Shortly after sitting down, several small boats came by selling watermelon seeds, puffed rice candy, peanuts, tangerines, preserved fruits, as well as smoked meats, pastries, braised dishes, roast chicken, and other provisions. The voyage to Huizhou on this type of old-style boat took about three days and nights. There weren't many places to stop for meals along the way, so passengers had to stock up on food and snacks.

Yuan Shuzhi watched passengers generously open their purses and buy lots of provisions, secretly surprised. Because passengers on such boats were mostly lower-class folk who generally wouldn't splurge on snacks or expensive prepared foods—mostly they made food at home and brought it. Yet now their spending was so generous!

Thinking carefully, the Great Song had entered the city over two years ago. The four directions were peaceful, people's livelihoods had stabilized somewhat, and industry and commerce were developing. These two years, though not perfectly smooth, hadn't seen any major disasters either. People had more money in hand—quite the appearance of "harvested an extra three to five bushels."

Though Yuan Shuzhi usually "wholeheartedly supported" the Senate's governance, he also had his own assessments. The Senate's land surveying and tax clarification in the countryside alone reduced countless ordinary people's burdens. Moreover, the state-owned grain company's purchasing in the countryside also curbed small grain merchants' joint price suppression.

All these actions had increased people's incomes. With food and clothing no longer worries, people naturally sought better enjoyment. This was human nature. During civil service training, Yuan Shuzhi had studied the three levels of human needs; applying it now in analysis, he found the three levels quite sensible. This Elder Marx was truly a great master!

He'd brought dry rations and didn't want to spend money, so after watching the bustle for a while, he took out a magazine from his bag and began reading. Speaking of this magazine called *Huanzhou*, newly founded, it specifically solicited submissions from schools, academies, and naturalized citizen cadres, sometimes also commissioning articles from local cultural celebrities. As for content, mainly articles on literature, history, and philosophy—very much to Old Yuan's taste.

This issue featured one of Yuan Shuzhi's articles—scholarly analysis of several place name variations in *Dream of the Red Chamber*. Most importantly, there was also a Lingao travelogue by Zhang Dai of the Restoration Society. Not only had his own article been typeset and beautifully printed, but being published alongside such a talented scholar made Old Yuan more pleased with his article the more he looked at it—almost intoxicated. He didn't even notice when the boat departed or where it had traveled to.

He was still thinking: "Not in vain did I spend so many rest days writing this manuscript. Being published in the same issue as Master Zongtao—this lifetime was worth it." And indeed it was worth it—from this point on, Old Yuan emerged in the field of Red Chamber studies and eventually became a master.

"Your minister has heard that punishing without teaching is called cruelty... Chairman Wen knows your minister is cautious... Therefore in May we crossed to Hainan, deep among the masses. Now the South Seas are pacified, teachers are sufficient... Song people and Ming people are all one body... The Ming nation's people are also the Senate's beloved children... Those who appreciate Australian learning and are loyal and good should attend the study societies and academies... Together basking in the Senate's glory. At the memorial, tears stream down..." He was reading an article promoting the "Common Script, Common Ancestry Movement" when he grew drowsy. In moments, he fell asleep amid the gentle rocking of the boat and the gurgling sound of water.

When he woke it was already noon. Yuan Shuzhi wiped the drool that had run out. He saw the boat had docked at a market town's wharf. This was a market town; many short-distance passengers had disembarked here, and new passengers had come aboard.

This private boat was different from Qiwei's. Because the journey was long and passed through many places, passengers got on and off very frequently along the way. There was specifically a boatwoman lookout who at every market town ferry landing would call from the bow: "Boarding, boarding! Seats available on the boat!"

Particularly many people boarded here—the cabin was packed full of passengers, already quite cramped, with two people sitting on portable stools in the middle.

Shortly after leaving the market town, they reached a rural ferry landing where people got on and off. Hearing the local dialect nearby, it seemed to be a small place called Huangxi.

Two or three people boarded this time, all looking like local villagers. Among them, a stocky, short, stout man came aboard but instead of finding a seat, loudly called out in the boat: "How much to Tangxia?!"

His voice was quite loud, jolting the drowsy Old Yuan alert. Looking at this man in his thirties or forties, though he wore a hair bun, he was dressed in garish colors with multiple tears in his clothes. His face was incongruously smeared with rouge and powder like a mischievous child. Around his neck hung a large silver lock—quite comical.

Without waiting for the boatwoman to respond, he began clapping and singing a nursery rhyme to himself.
