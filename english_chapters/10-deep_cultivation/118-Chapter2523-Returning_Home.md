# Chapter 2523: Returning Home

It seemed like a huge discount, but the common people didn't buy it. Tian Liang had strength but nowhere to use it, and was at his wits' end. Fortunately, Hou Qing had been patrolling various parts of Nanhai County recently for the "Rural Health Training" work. The two of them partnering up could be considered finding joy amidst hardship.

"Sister Qing, if that scholar could come to be a teacher, that would be truly great..."

"You silly goose! Do you know who he is?" Hou Qing asked with a laugh.

"Who is he?"

"He is Kuang Lu! Kuang Lu!" Hou Qing said. "A famous gentry master in Guangzhou City! Him coming to be our teacher, that would be the sun rising from the west!"

"Gentry from a big household? He doesn't look like it to me. He's quite easygoing, wrote spring couplets for everyone, and was the first to donate."

"Who said gentry must have green faces and jagged teeth?" Hou Qing said. "This Kuang Lu is not an ordinary gentry; the Senate also values him very much—after you go back, you have to write a report to the municipal government telling them that Kuang Lu has returned."

"Is he some reactionary figure?"

"Well, it's hard to say he's reactionary. In short, he's an important figure." Hou Qing actually couldn't explain clearly where Kuang Lu was important; she had just seen the list of key gentry to watch issued by the Administration Council, and Kuang Lu's name was on it.

"Then I must hurry to write it. But how did you know?"

"Do you never read documents?"

"Documents?" Tian Liang scratched his head, somewhat embarrassed. "I don't read very well; it's laborious to read them."

"How did you become a captain?" Hou Qing sighed helplessly. "A company commander also has a lot of paperwork to do."

"There was a lieutenant in the company who graduated from the military academy; he did all those things..."

"You played the hands-off manager quite well."

"Sigh, isn't that why I came to be a principal..." Tian Liang was dejected.

"Even if you are a principal, you have to put your heart into it. If you can't even understand documents like this, how will you do things in the future?" Hou Qing was a bit anxious. "How about this: whenever I have free time at night in the future, I'll help you study the documents. And help you learn a few more characters along the way."

Kuang Lu and his servant left Dali and traveled south all the way. In a few days, they arrived outside Guangzhou City. It was the period of the Little Ice Age; although it was Lingnan, the weather brought by the cold wave was as cold and bleak as the north. The trees that were lush in previous years appeared withered and listless this year, with yellow leaves covering the ground nearby and withered grass stretching to the sky in the distance.

Looking out at his hometown, it was a scene of depression and desolation. Associating this with the chaos of war everywhere in the country at this time, the people in deep water and scorching fire, and the various disorders in the imperial court and local areas... He had borne the ambition to serve the country but failed to share the ruler's worries. Instead, because of a moment of anger, he had to wander in a foreign land for several years...

Sadness came from within, and his eyes grew slightly wet. Seeing the city wall appear, the Guangzhou he had thought of day and night was right before his eyes.

But what kind of Guangzhou was this exactly? It was no longer the Guangzhou Prefecture of the Great Ming, but the "Guangzhou Special City" of the Kun thieves. Seeing it again at this time, there was truly a unique flavor in his heart.

Above the city tower, the banner of the Kun thieves fluttered. Foot soldiers patrolled with guns. Below the city tower were bailiffs wearing black jackets and short coats, watching the commoners and vehicles entering and leaving the city, stopping them for inspection from time to time.

Being a citizen of a fallen nation was probably like this.

"Master, it's getting late. Let's hurry into the city," Kuang Yan reminded.

"Let's go."

Kuang Lu felt bitter. He settled the porter fees, sent away the long-distance mule and porter he had hired, and walked into the city from the Great North Gate with his servant.

His home was in Xianlin Lane beside the Temple of the Five Immortals in Guangzhou. This day happened to be the twenty-fourth day of the twelfth lunar month, the day every household bid farewell to the Kitchen God. The entire year of 1636 had been favorable in wind and rain, and the Senate had engaged in large-scale construction and many infrastructure and industrial investments in places like Guangzhou, so the market in Guangzhou was quite booming. The streets presented a scene of prosperity.

The Farewell to the Kitchen God was one of the most important days in the twelfth lunar month; the streets were full of people coming and going, very lively.

With the "New Life Movement" implemented since 1635 and the massive demolition and construction within the city, the appearance of Guangzhou had greatly changed compared to when Kuang Lu left.

Walking along the way, Kuang Lu saw such changes, and his heart was filled with mixed feelings. Suddenly, Kuang Yan shouted beside him, "Isn't that Second Master coming over there?"

Looking up, he saw a handsome young man rushing over on a two-wheeled rickshaw. Before reaching them, he jumped off the vehicle, came to the front in a few steps, threw himself on the ground, hugged Kuang Lu, and began to cry loudly. Kuang Lu also wept loudly. Although passersby didn't know why, they sighed at the sight—born in troubled times, they had seen too many partings of life and death; the taste of reuniting with relatives was even more extraordinary.

"Eryu, why must you do this? In broad daylight and before the public eye. It's a loss of decorum." Although Kuang Lu scolded, he couldn't suppress the smile on his face.

Eryu cried and complained, "Since knowing that Brother met with misfortune, we brothers have worried day and night. Uncle missed you so much he fell ill, asking about us constantly, not knowing when you would return. gone for several years, with only fragments of letters sent home. Big Brother, you really have a cruel heart..."

"Speak if you have something to say; why are you acting like a little girl!" Kuang Lu held back his tears and said, "While outside, I worried about Father and you brothers constantly. But correspondence was inconvenient, and I drifted uncertainly; it was hard to find someone to entrust letters to... All these years, the family has relied entirely on you brothers to take care of things..."

"Big Brother, say no more. Uncle, sister-in-law, and nephews are all waiting." Eryu wiped his tears. "Please follow me home quickly."

After speaking, he called the rickshaw behind him over, tied the luggage and items to the vehicle, and the two brothers walked home together with the servant.

Along the way, Eryu couldn't suppress his joy and spoke of many family matters. In the years Kuang Lu was away, besides living on the rent rice from the rented fields in the countryside, several old friends and relatives also helped out from time to time. Although life wasn't wealthy, it wasn't destitute either. This somewhat comforted Kuang Lu, who had been wandering outside.

In no time, they arrived at the house door. This residence of the Kuang family was built after his grandfather passed the *jinshi* examination, and now it showed signs of dilapidation. The *jinshi* flagpoles in front of the door were gone, leaving only a few flagpole stones. Because his father was only a Stipend Student and hadn't passed the provincial examination or obtained the *jinshi* degree, the family fortune inevitably declined.

When he lived here in the past, going in and out, he never felt anything. Returning as a wanderer after many years and seeing the old house again, he couldn't help but feel the sorrow of seeing wheat growing in the ruins of the capital.

But the fact that his old mother lived here really made his heart ache. Before he could think in detail, the young servant at the door had already seen him and flew into the courtyard shouting, "He's here, he's here, the Eldest Master is back."

Kuang Lu lifted his foot to enter the gate, turned past the spirit screen, and saw his white-haired old father being supported by two nephews as he walked out.

Thinking of his willful waywardness, offending the magistrate, and having to leave his old father, wife, and children to go far away to a foreign land, leaving for several years—neither fulfilling the way of a son nor the responsibility of a husband and father, instead causing them to worry about him—he couldn't help but feel guilty. Taking three steps in two, he rushed in front of his father, knelt down, and cried bitterly.

Although he had already received the news that his son was returning, it wasn't until his son was crying in front of him that Kuang Sihao realized his long-missed son had truly arrived. For a moment, he couldn't speak, only trembling as he stroked his son, tears streaming down his face as well. Seeing this scene, everyone couldn't help but sob. For a time, no one spoke in the main hall; only the sound of soft sobbing was heard.

After a long time, Kuang Lu looked at his father with teary eyes and said, "This son is unfilial, this son is guilty, this son deserves to die ten thousand times." As he spoke, he kept kowtowing, making thumping sounds.

Father Kuang supported his son. Although he had thousands of words, he couldn't say a single one. After a long while, he said, "It's good that you're back! I'm fine; it was your wife and children who suffered! Go see them quickly!"

Everyone supported Father Kuang and then Kuang Lu, persuading them not to cry, saying this was a joyous occasion and not to be too sad, as health was important. After everyone comforted them for a long time, the two's emotions finally calmed down. Someone then led him to the rear hall to meet his wife and children.

Husband and wife hadn't seen each other for many years; meeting again naturally involved an outpouring of feelings after a long separation. It was just that his son was no longer very familiar with this father who had left home for many years and was somewhat afraid.

This day was the Kitchen God Festival. Originally, relatives and old friends were all sacrificing to the stove in their own homes. Hearing that Kuang Lu was returning, they all came over to congratulate him. For a time, the house was filled with laughter and joy.

Even the neighbors came out to watch. Several families who had always been on good terms with the Kuang family prepared gifts and came to congratulate him upon hearing of his return. Kuang Lu busily went out to exchange bows with the neighbors. Just as he was busy, he suddenly saw several servants carrying two loads of gifts approaching from a distance. He recognized the leader; his name was Zhang He, the servant of his good friend Zhang Mu.

Zhang He saw Kuang Lu from afar, left the servants carrying the loads, trotted all the way to him, knelt down, and reported, "Greetings to First Master Kuang! My master heard that the First Master arrived home and specially prepared some local produce and food, and additionally enclosed two hundred taels of silver to send to the First Master for washing away the dust. My master said: The First Master must be attending to his father with filial piety these few days, so he won't come to disturb the First Master today. After the New Year, my master will personally bring a card to pay a visit."

Hearing this, Kuang Lu smiled and said, "Many thanks for your master's intent; I will accept all the things. Go back and report to your master that once I have settled my family affairs, I will definitely go to his residence to express my thanks." He immediately ordered Eryu to give a tip and sent them back.

After finishing this side and returning to the main hall to reminisce with relatives and friends, someone reported again that old acquaintances from various places had heard of his return and came to send gifts. Even the family of the late Liang Yuanzhu sent gifts. For a time, the front of the Chen family gate was bustling like a marketplace. Eryu was busy running back and forth, urging servants to count and record the delivered gifts while distributing tips to the servants and porters who delivered them. The formerly cold and quiet front of the Kuang residence swept away the heavy atmosphere of days past.

Kuang Lu returned from a neighbor's house. Suddenly, a few more young pages came over with gifts. The leader didn't call out his name and present a card loudly as soon as he arrived at the door like those from other families; he only stood aside and watched. Seeing Kuang Lu pass by, he immediately stepped forward, paid his respects, and whispered, "My master is Chen Zizhuang. Knowing the First Master returned today, he specially sent this servant to present gifts to congratulate you. Here is also an invitation." After speaking, he stuffed the gift list and invitation into Kuang Yan's hands, put down the gifts, and left quietly.
