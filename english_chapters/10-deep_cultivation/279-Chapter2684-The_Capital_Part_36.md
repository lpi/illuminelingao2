# Chapter 2684: The Capital (Part 36)

Mr. Zhou was accompanying his daughter to build a snowman in the courtyard—saying Zhou Juli wanted to build a snowman, but it was actually a cover; deep down, he was the one who wanted to play with snow. After all, as a Southerner born in Zhejiang and educated in Guangzhou, he had rarely seen such heavy snow, let alone goose-feather snow capable of making snowmen.

Hearing the servant say Master Wang came to pay a New Year call and was already at the door, he hurriedly went out to welcome him.

"Yo, Lord Wang, why have you come?" He bowed with hands clasped to pay the New Year call while inviting him in.

"Just passing by on the way, came to pay Mr. Zhou a New Year call." Wang Yehao entered the door and saw the courtyard organized in perfect order, with some flowers, plants, and installations not seen last time. It seemed this Hearthstone Immortal had quite a taste for life—this made things easier to handle.

"This must be Juli. Look at this kid; truly makes people fond of her." Wang Yehao bent down kindly and pinched Zhou Juli's cheek, which was frozen red. The girl hid behind Mr. Zhou, sizing up the other party curiously with a pair of big eyes.

"Why shy away from strangers? This is Uncle Wang." Mr. Zhou picked up his daughter, pinched her nose affectionately, then greeted the guest, "Don't stand at the door; come into the house quickly!"

Mr. Zhou handed the daughter to a servant woman, then led Wang Yehao to the study in the side courtyard. Obviously, Mr. Zhou had no interest in studying ancient books usually, so rather than a study, it was more appropriate to call it a chess-and-card room cum laboratory.

He had opened up all three rooms of this study and arranged many brand-new furniture pieces inside—the original tables, chairs, and furnishings didn't quite fit Mr. Zhou's aesthetic taste and usage, so he specially found a carpenter to customize the whole set. The carpenter was quite resistant to Mr. Zhou's guiding opinions filled with cross-era significance and went on strike several times to protest. This also made Mr. Zhou realize a profound truth: stories about casually copying a modern design to lead fashion trends in the transmigration world and earning pots full of money were all TMD [damn] lying to ghosts!

Lord Wang, whose self-restraint was obviously better than the carpenter's, gave a pertinent and conservative evaluation of Mr. Zhou's design: "Mr. Zhou's study furnishings are quite unique."

"Oh, this is the minimalist route." Mr. Zhou moved a chair over to introduce. "Lord, please look; this chair is just four wooden strips and two boards. Easy to assemble, novel style. And that is a lazy person's sofa [bean bag chair], filled with buckwheat husks inside. Although the selling appearance isn't much, it's quite comfortable to sit on. Does the Lord want to try?"

Wang Yehao looked at the few cotton cloth bags on the ground, really finding it somewhat unacceptable. Although he despised it in his heart, his mouth remained very polite: "Hehe, Mr. Zhou's decorations are authentically clumsy and elegant, great skill appearing unpolished, seemingly having the legacy style of Wei and Jin."

"Not Wei and Jin style, it's Nordic style... Uh, it's just that this style is popular in the place where I learned my art." Mr. Zhou lay very comfortably on a lazy person's sofa. Wang Yehao struggled for half a day, still not knowing how to lower his bottom. Fortunately, Zhou Lezhi was doing experiments in the study and hurriedly moved over a round-backed armchair.

At this moment, Zhou Lezhi was doing experiments in the study—the experimental apparatuses were all cobbled together by him following the Teacher. Some were made by carpenters according to drawings from the Teacher; some were searched and bought from various markets and shops by Zhou Lezhi according to the Teacher's requirements. They were combined into a set of crude and simple experimental equipment.

Seeing Master Wang and the Teacher seated, Zhou Lezhi was about to withdraw, but the Teacher said: "No need. You are my student; listening from the side is also good." After speaking, he asked again: "Is he in the way?"

"Not in the way," Wang Yehao revealed a smile. "Who doesn't have a few confidants! He is the Teacher's inner disciple; this student naturally trusts him."

Zhou Lezhi hurriedly thanked them, then quickly went to the door to take the tea and snacks sent by the servant and brought them to the table—at the beginning of the New Year, the "Zhou Residence" prepared several Nanyang-style tea snacks and specially prepared Yuanbao tea according to the Teacher's instructions.

Seeing this Yuanbao tea, Wang Yehao felt a longing for water shield soup and sea bass [homesickness/nostalgia], remembering that this mysterious Hearthstone Immortal could eventually be counted as a person from the same big hometown. Pity that despite all probing, he still didn't know his true face today. Although the help was great, there was always a feeling of thorns on the back.

He took a shallow sip of tea and picked up an olive to hold in his mouth.

"Since knowing the Teacher in *Guangli*, it has been three years in a flash, yet I rarely hear the Teacher talk about the previous learning of arts."

Zhou Lezhi stood behind the Teacher and couldn't see his expression, but from his starting to tilt his head and the habitual movement of touching his eyebrows, he knew the Teacher was quite embarrassed by this topic: "This, there is a confidentiality agreement. Cannot talk casually outside; will suffer divine punishment."

"Heavenly secrets are mysterious; Daoist methods are subtle and profound. Didn't expect that with supernatural powers like the Teacher's, one still has to keep clear rules and commandments. Presumably, learning the art must have been unusually arduous." Wang Yehao sipped the tea, joking cheerfully.

The Teacher also complained along the flow: "More than arduous, simply inhuman. Endless water-grinding effort [tedious work]... no SCI published... If I hadn't refined the Qiankun Mirror, I wouldn't know how many more years I'd have to muddle through." After speaking, a painful expression appeared on his face; presumably, that life of cultivation was unbearable to look back on.

"Speaking of which, the Teacher's Qiankun Mirror hasn't been found yet, right? Don't know if there are clues recently?"

"Sigh, hard to find. Don't know where those Australians are hiding either." Mr. Zhou sighed, appearing very helpless.

"Teacher, please look." Wang Yehao signaled Liu Zhao to present several items from *Zizhenzhai*.

Mr. Zhou took them to look for a few glances, and his face changed. After playing with them repeatedly, he pursued asking: "This came from Guangzhou?"

"Correct, but not obtained from Gao Ju's hands, but bought from a shop called *Zizhenzhai*." Wang Yehao watched his face. "The proprietor is called Guo Yi. Does the Teacher know him?"

"So saying, the Australians are back?! And opened a shop!" Mr. Zhou's expression became very agitated.

"Nine out of ten it is so."

"Right, right, this is the Australians' stuff!" Mr. Zhou stood up suddenly, turning around indiscriminately in the study. "I should have thought of it, should have thought of it earlier!"

Wang Yehao thought there was no mistake; he indeed knew the Australians' background!

"What is the background of this Guo Yi? Does the Master know?" Mr. Zhou suddenly stopped and asked.

"Says he is a Guangzhou local and can also speak fluent Cantonese. However..." Wang Yehao smiled meaningfully.

Mr. Zhou froze there, seemingly his whole brain filled with thoughts. Only after a long time did he say:

"I want to go to Guangzhou to check."

"Teacher need not rush for a moment." Wang Yehao said, "From the capital to Guangzhou is a thousand li away, with many inconveniences. This student actually has some manpower; perhaps can lend the Teacher an arm's force."

Mr. Zhou hesitated slightly, feeling although there was risk, it was also a method: "If the Lord is willing to help find them, naturally that's best. Just one thing: if clues are found, never act rashly. Must wait for me to collect them."

"Oh? Don't know what explanation this has?"

Mr. Zhou started touching his eyebrows habitually again: "En, this, this, specifically speaking, this treasure is relatively delicate and expensive, not easy to control. If controlled well, moving mountains of gold and silver is not a problem; if not controlled well, en, en," he suddenly roused his spirit, "The explosion three years ago, the Lord remembers, right? Even more powerful than that!"

Pity this explosion danger didn't scare Wang Yehao. Instead, he seemed suddenly interested, asking with eyes shining: "Teacher just said this thing can also move mountains of gold and silver?"

"That's not blowing [bragging] to you!" Seeing the other party's strong interest, Mr. Zhou drew a big pancake [made empty promises] along the flow. "Only what you can't think of, nothing I can't move. Pearls, jadeite, glazed glass, agate, those are all small toys."

"Didn't expect there is such a treasure in the world." Wang Yehao couldn't help stroking his beard and sighing long after hearing Mr. Zhou brag. "If one has this way of generating wealth, then one can make the court's treasuries full and soldiers' rations and pay sufficient. In this way, what worry about the Jianzhou Slaves not being destroyed."

"Destroying that bunch of Jianzhou Slave cavalry is easy as lifting a hand; get a few machine guns and *tut-tut* them all." Mr. Zhou got more excited as he spoke. "This machine gun is a continuous-firing fire铳 [firearm], with a range of four or five li away; cavalry basically can't get close."

Wang Yehao listened to Mr. Zhou talk nonsense with considerable restraint for less than an hour before getting up to bid farewell. Before leaving, at Mr. Zhou's request, he left these "Australian treasures" behind, supposedly to "research."

Liu Zhao saw the guest off on behalf of the master outside the door and whispered: "Master, what does the Master think of Mr. Zhou's words today?"

"Hard to distinguish true from false..." Wang Yehao shook his head. "There may be false words and pretexts, but this Official feels this Qiankun Mirror should truly exist."

"Subordinate feels if this Qiankun Mirror really has such supernatural power, then things make sense."

"Oh? How so?"

Liu Zhao led Wang Yehao to the side and whispered: "Can't guarantee that Qiankun Mirror really fell into the Australians' hands. Under chance and coincidence, they comprehended some driving methods, so they made these glazed glass treasures."

Wang Yehao's eyes lit up, suddenly feeling the whole matter strung together. The claim in the report that a mere few dozen Lingao village braves could kill hundreds of sea bandit heads was simply absurd. Moreover, Lingao County was a poor village and remote soil, with almost no oil and water; Old Liu Xiang had absolutely no need to send a thousand thugs to plunder. The only explanation fitting common reason was that Australians occupied Lingao, set up altars to perform rituals, and used the Qiankun Mirror to make glazed glass vessels. This business of no capital and ten thousand profits made Old Liu Xiang jealous and itchy, wanting to take it for himself. Sea bandits fought each other, both sides suffered losses, and Lingao County then reaped the fisherman's profit, picking up hundreds of heads to report. Since glazed glass vessels were still on sale, it meant the Australians hadn't collapsed yet and were still in Lingao. So it seemed that Guo Yi was not without foundation; besides Gao Ju, there was at least a large group of sea bandits backing him.

Thinking of this, Wang Yehao felt somewhat excited. If such a treasure could be collected for his own use, wouldn't it be wonderful? Pondering for a moment, Wang Yehao withdrew his mind and asked: "Asked you to investigate carefully the relationship between that Guo Yi and Eunuch Yang and Gao Ju the day before yesterday; what is the result?"

"Small one already verified: *Zizhenzhai* did not throw itself [offer service] to Eunuch Yang; he just relies on Gao Ju to establish a foothold in Guangzhou."

"Hehe, since there is no backer, then this Official will find one for him." Wang Yehao smiled meaningfully. "Don't know if that Miss Pei suits Imperial Relative Tian's taste."
