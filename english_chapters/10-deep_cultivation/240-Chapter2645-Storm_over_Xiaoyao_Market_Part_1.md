# Chapter 2645: Storm over Xiaoyao Market (Part 1)

"Li Guangyuan became Immortal. This Eight Immortals Society in this belt counts as achieving momentum. Like fire like tea." Man speaking casually threw fish hook into river, "Next what to do?"

Asked man draped straw raincoat, wore bamboo hat. A look of River Fisher Old Man appearance. Exactly was Taoist Wood Stone (*Mu Shi Dao Ren*).

Only saw him narrowing eyes, looking at floats carrying sinking carrying floating in river water. Issued a light laugh.

"Next, naturally want to watch Li Guangyuan sing Grand Opera."

Asking, was exactly Gou Xunli alias Walrus Monk. He received order to go to Li Family Enclosure to fan wind light fire. Let Eight Immortals Society took down Li Family Enclosure. Now task already completed. He in Li Family Enclosure admittedly received deep respect, yet felt great doubt towards Taoist Wood Stone's arrangement. Helping Eight Immortals Society open eyes in such bigger flag drum beating way, not afraid Xue Tu eating vinegar (jealous)么? After all Eight Immortals Society was just a small society sect. In "Anti-Kun League" was just a small character.

Although supporting Eight Immortals Society had intention of checking balancing Heaven Way League (*Tian Dao Meng*) Xue Tu branch, but right now current great enemy in front. Kun Thieves cunning cruel. Anxiously engaging in this set of dividing and ruling power technique more or less somewhat not at time.

Not understanding returning to not understanding. This Taoist Wood Stone in front of eyes grasped whole situation. Was Old Stone's agent. These years god appearing ghost disappearing in Two Guangs boundary. Repeatedly escaped from Kun Thieves Depot Guard hands. He not only "Lived," still arranged calmly in Kun Thieves' layers of dragnet. Strung up various forces. Managed Anti-Kun forces with sound with color. "Old Stone's" full support naturally didn't need say. But if without this person's running, basically impossible to create current situation.

He arranging like this now, probably also had some intention inside. But this unfathomable, instead made Gou Xunli often have thorn on back. Under such high person, was a chess piece allowed to abandon anytime...

He hesitated whether asking down continuously. Taoist Wood Stone took initiative to speak down: "Li Family Enclosure sound larger better. Just attractive them all to Panyu, Dongguan this side. Nanhai, Sanshui that belt they then have no time to attend. Just good to do a big matter."

Gou Xunli dared not ask what big matter. Just continued looking at float. Pondered for half while only then asked:

"In Li Family Enclosure still want to do what?"

Taoist Wood Stone didn't answer him immediately. Just lifted fishing rod. Re-installed bait on already eaten empty hook throwing back to water. Only then low voice said:

"You still have a few things to do in Li Family Enclosure..."

Xiaoyao Market because was water land thoroughfare, commercial channel. Gathered quite some travelers from all directions. Among them naturally also not lacking one of Guangdong Three Big Communities Hakkas.

Different from other places Cantonese people majority. Xiaoyao Market here was Hakkas' small world. On southwest corner of Xiaoyao Market had several square earth enclosing buildings (*Tu Wei Lou*) named "Four Points Gold" (*Si Dian Jin*). Two-story transverse house outer wall built by rammed earth. First floor no window. Second floor opened small window. Two ends of transverse house, built Gathering Mountain Style (*Cuan Shan Shi*) Square Towers higher than transverse house again. On top opened shooting holes and observation ports. Inside prepared bows crossbows. With surrounding several such earth enclosing buildings scattered orderly relative to each other. Both could wall strictly self, and could support each other. Many times protected residents from harassment attack of bandits water pirates. Just living condition of earth enclosing building had many inconveniences. Rich families early built other Manor Courtyards near enclosing building. Later had newly migrated coming building various small houses at outer rim again. Forming a settlement taking earth enclosing building as center.

After population accumulated, Hakka gentry here saw local water land traffic convenient. Then set up Market at this place. An earth road straight through river side ferry crossing and pier. Also branched out several branch roads. Road two sides stood various trade signboards like forest. Very lively.

Recently, near pier newly stood up Kun Thieves' barracks. Daily punctual bugle sound added a portion of desolate killing air to Xiaoyao Market.

Since having this barracks, every few days had Australian fleet coming to Xiaoyao Market to park. Unloading many goods. According to moving short term workers said, moved down mostly timber, lime sand etc. construction materials. Probably Australians wanted to repair big house here.

Just past Chén Hour (7-9 AM). On street surface not that enthusiastic as past days. Even soliciting men gathering at snack shops, tea water stalls etc. waiting for jobs usually also few a few portions. Only hanging ragged knots begging flower (beggar) still same as usual, for a day's food wandering in front of various businesses. Singing various Happy Songs. Begging for reward money.

"Baoyu Pawnshop true style ah~ true style, Green Mountain Big River cheer together na~ cheer together. Gold Silver full room God of Wealth comes ya~ God of Wealth comes, Pixiu guarding gate..."

"Don't sing, don't sing. Shop Owner has serious matter. Change a door." Little apprentice wiping table desk heard Lotus Fall (*Lian Hua Lao*) coming out to welcome. Opening pawnshop stressed mouth luck most. Since someone sang happy song at door, also inconvenient to drive away hard. Saying took out a note throwing into beggar's broken pottery bowl.

Beggar smiled: "Now changed to paper note. Without a ring of copper coin entering bowl. This song singing all has no energy."

Apprentice smiled: "You still want copper coin! This year month even silver all becomes paper one! Let alone silver ingot silver锞子 (small ingot), even silver dollar can't see a few pieces! This Great Song's world true rare. Daily saying self how rich possessing world. Making half day silver becomes paper money!"

Beside "Head Counter" stared him an eye. Scolded: "You eat full supported (swelled/too full)! Saying these useless fart words. Sweep quickly. Shopkeeper and East Owner in a while coming out."

This beggar seeing apprentice without intention of giving again. Then went towards next family.

"I look his profession actually good", Beside Fourth Counter smiled, "One person eats full, whole family not hungry. Also not laboring heart wasting strength. True giving an Emperor not exchanging."

"You understand what?" Second Counter sneered, "They being beggars also have rules. On top have Big Bone (Boss) managing. Got money first have to honor Big Bone. If you no money to honor, light beating a meal, heavy directly driving you out. At that time even begging has no place!"

"Their this profession, also can't do how long." Head Counter said, "Once Australians arrived Guangzhou then destroyed beggars' old nest! Big Bones all chopped heads! Beggars all exiled to what Taiwan to plant land. Even local, beggars in county city all caught away. Just countryside, still has their a bit place to accommodate body."

"Once this Australians come, fear they also can't stay down."

"Without these people harassing, Master also reduced an expenditure. You don't look down upon this money, true not few!"

"Then why Master still looks Australians not pleasing to eye all day to night?" Fourth Counter asked curiously.

"Who knows? Master thinks much, thinks deep. We don't understand..."

"Why looking not pleasing to eye, isn't because Master Fan..." Second Counter pretended deep said.

This "Master Fan" was Market Owner of Xiaoyao Market. And this Xiaoyao Market's place name also obtained from him. Master Fan big name Fan Xiao. Just named market on own land skin as Xiaoyao Market. Earth buildings on southwest corner of Xiaoyao Market were his family's. Although Li Guangyuan locally was "Local Snake," but this Master Fan sat guarding this Xiaoyao Market, entering peck of gold daily. Financial power abundant. Key was his family also had degree leaning on body. Was "Gentry" in county. Although not as Li Family people many land many, also enough to divide court resist rite (rival) with Master Li locally. Two families although polite on surface, encountering matters always wanted to hook heart fight corner (scheme against) in dark a round.

Arrival of Australians, added some variables to this "Two Strongs" situation again. Australians first time passing Xiaoyao Market, on market for a time was also wind sound crane cry (jittery). Even had Master Fan's family people appearing to maintain, various shops still closed door up board resting for two days. Later Australians issued Peace Notice. Shops on market selected liaison and Australians agreed on Reasonable Burden. Various shopkeepers only then returned to hang sign open business again.

However, Australians stayed in Xiaoyao Market not long time. No more than three five days then left. Afterwards although passing occasionally, never stayed heavily stationed here for long time. Gradually, big guys also more or less forgot their existence. Only heard Master Fan served as Xiaoyao Market "Head Pai Jia." On private face he was Market Owner. On official face he was Australians' Pai Jia. As usual suppressed countryside Local Moneybag Li Guangyuan fiercely a head.

Later again, Australians promoted New Currency locally. Recruited local shops to accept. Also ordered various to receive and use. Not allowed to defy. Silver exchanging Silver Cake (Coin) nothing. Although on weight felt somewhat eating loss, but this Australian Silver Cake fineness good, look also exquisite. Accepting using definitely won't eat loss. But this "Silver Yuan Note" let old Moneybags mumbled.

Inside First Class Big Shops of Xiaoyao Market, Li Guangyuan's Baoyu originally was also one of Accepting Business Houses. Li Guangyuan heard wanting to accept Silver Yuan Note, then firmly resigned this matter. Afterwards was coldly treated by Australians greatly. Implicating establishing Chamber of Commerce on market, as one of biggest business houses Baoyu was just an ordinary "Member Enterprise." Even a "Director" didn't mix on. This also made Li Guangyuan take to heart deeply.

He putting all eggs in one basket joining "Anti-Kun Great Enterprise," stimulation given by these scattered small matters was also a reason.

Apprentices just idly knocking teeth (chatting). Shopkeeper sent a few people from backyard to gate. Let Fourth Counter apprentice lead them walking towards pier direction. Among these few people, leading was exactly Luo Heying and Li Guangfa. They arrived Xiaoyao Market yesterday. Quietly stayed into Li Family's shop on Xiaoyao Market—Backyard of Baoyu Pawnshop.

Today early morning then departed to near Kun Thieves Barracks by river side to spy Kun Thieves' actual situation. Conveniently go look at location selection of new shop again.

Fourth Counter just rose up from apprentice not long. Seeing Master bringing noble guest here. Extremely attentive. Since ancient times Pawnshop apprentice treatment most generous. But also not ordinary person could be competent. Those able to finish apprenticeship becoming formal partners, not only business proficient familiar, on human feeling world wisdom also not comparable by ordinary person.

Asking recently on market had any fresh matters related to Australians. Apprentice said: "Repairing road building house this not count as fresh matter. Instead issued a kind of new money."

Li Guangyuan fiercely stood steps. Surprised said: "New money?"

"Yes, new money." Apprentice seeing Master expression solemn, dare not light heart. Slightly thought said: "This money started using this Monday. Right now on market not much. Shopkeeper originally wanted to come report to East Owner these few days..."
