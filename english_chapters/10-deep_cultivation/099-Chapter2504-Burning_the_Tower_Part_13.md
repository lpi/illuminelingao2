# Chapter 2504: Burning the Tower (13)

Seeing the situation under control, Xue Tu nodded approvingly and walked slowly to Liu Jun's side, gently patting him on the shoulder. Liu Jun's tense body trembled, then suddenly relaxed, bowing his body softly. Xue Tu looked at him with a smile, then suddenly took a step back. With a *clang*, he drew the dragon-devouring treasure sword from his waist and stabbed Liu Jun in the chest. The long sword pierced through his chest and back. Xue Tu took a big step forward, held the sword with both hands, and pushed forward with all his might. with a *hiss*, the blade sank in up to the handle. Then he twisted it with full force using both hands, slowly agitating inside Liu Jun's chest cavity. The intense pain caused Liu Jun to lose all strength. The iron hammer in his hand fell to the ground with a *clang*. His mouth gaped open, staring at Xue Tu with eyes full of despair, malice, and disbelief. Massive internal bleeding spewed from his mouth. At this moment, the two were standing almost face to face. Xue Tu extended his head slightly forward and whispered in Liu Jun's ear with a voice only the two could hear, "Brother need not worry about the old and young at home; I, Xue, will take care of them all." After speaking, he kicked Liu Jun fiercely in the abdomen, using the momentum to pull back with both hands and draw out the long sword. A blood mist sprayed from Liu Jun's chest, and he fell backward with a *plop*. Fearing he might spout nonsense before dying, Xue Tu rushed forward and stabbed again at the throat before stopping.

After killing the man, Xue Tu threw away the treasure sword and said loudly, "Whether Junior Brother Liao was truly guilty is not yet known. Even if there was truly an act of rebelling against the Way and betraying righteousness, the punishment gate should have been opened wide. According to the thirty-two great rules and sixty-four small precepts, whether killing or punishing, the Punisher should have judged fairly based on reason. How could a disciple kill his master, committing such an act of deceiving the master and destroying ancestors? Everyone gets to execute such a petty person. I hope all brothers take this as a warning."

After finishing his speech, Xue Tu lay on Liao Yongcheng's corpse and cried aloud, hitting the ground with his head until his forehead was red and swollen, crying until his voice was hoarse. Only when he was too weak to support himself did several sect leaders and senior disciples come forward to help him up and support him to sit on the round-backed armchair.

Seeing this, Wang Yunshan also prostrated himself on the ground and cried aloud, saying, "Thank you, Senior Uncle Xue, for avenging Master and executing this evil thief. In the future, if Senior Uncle Xue has any command, disciple will surely go through fire and water without declining. Now that the remaning sons of my Red Sun Way are all mediocre and find it hard to take charge of major affairs, I represent the brothers in the Way to make a bold request. I hope Senior Uncle Xue, the capable doing more work, will not decline hardness and suffering and take charge of the affairs of the Red Sun Way on our behalf. In the future, whether establishing a separate household or merging into the Heaven Gate Daoist Spirit Society, we will all listen to Senior Uncle's instructions. I still hope Senior Uncle will not decline, so as to comfort Master's spirit in heaven."

Xue Tu wiped his tears and said, "Since Junior Brother Liao has gone, I naturally will furnish a good funeral. A gang cannot be without a master for a day. Since it is so, I will force myself to do the difficult thing and temporarily take charge of the Red Sun Way's affairs. Matters within the Way will be assisted by Yunshan. When a person dies, the crime disappears. There is no need for large-scale implicating. Pause Junior Brother Liao in the backyard, and wait for matters to settle before entering the earth for peace."

Sitting below, Yang Tiezhou of the Eight Immortals Society and Ge Yaoxian of the Yellow Tassel Society were both trembling in their thighs, sweating profusely, unable to speak. Meanwhile, Guan He of Green Stone Stronghold, Song Dougian of the Buddha Fragrance Society, and Pockmarked Chen of the One Universe Primordial Chaos Dao were beaming with joy and high spirits.

Liao Yongcheng's corpse was carried down by two minions. His head drooped to the side, seemingly watching everything with gray-white eyes, watching demons and monsters run rampant in the world without scruples.

Xu Tong let out a long breath, narrowed his eyes, and silently watched everything before him, a cold sneer hanging at the corner of his mouth.

Xu Tong followed behind Li Baiqing, mixed in the crowd, looking forward. Xue Tu stood in the first position in the center. Wooden Stone Daoist, holding a whisk, stood tall behind Xue Tu. Seeing the situation was settled, Wooden Stone Daoist signaled with his eyes, and Xue Tu waved his hand. Twenty or so minions came, groups of four carrying more than ten wooden boxes in.

The boxes were made of high-quality hardwood, wrapped with iron corners and reinforced with iron hoops. They looked very sturdy. The four minions carrying them also appeared to find them very heavy.

The venue instantly fell into a commotion. Xue Tu didn't keep them in suspense; he immediately took out the keys and instructed the minions to open the boxes.

As soon as the box lids opened, silver light flashed inside. It was actually full of silver dollars! Shining white and bright, dazzling in the sunlight, momentarily blinding everyone.

Since ancient times, wealth has moved people's hearts. A box of silver dollars held at least a thousand pieces! The crowd instantly became excited, and everyone wanted to squeeze forward.

"Don't squeeze! Whovever dares to come up and move wildly, I'll chop off his dog head!"

Guan He, holding a horse-chopping saber, gave a sharp shout, suppressing the somewhat surging crowd.

Xue Tu made a "calm down" gesture and said deeply, "Brothers, do not be impatient. These silver dollars were sent by Governor Xiong. They are pay for everyone..."

As soon as this sentence came out, the crowd was in another commotion. Sects and secret societies mostly operated in the countryside. Although they seemed to have many members, and the leaders had considerable power in the countryside on ordinary days, in reality, the benefits were limited. Firstly, local clans were very strong, and the room for development of sects was very limited. Secondly, the people were poor, and no matter how devout, they couldn't bring out many "offerings." Sometimes, being a leader meant putting in one's own money and grain. So these sects and societies, seemingly with long histories, even some passed down for more than ten generations, were also obscure. In the final analysis, it was all about the word "money."

"Brothers of the various gates who came to the alliance meeting today, as long as you take out the roster, every name on the roster gets three silver dollars, regardless of age or size. This is the Imperial Court's gracious reward to us!"

Another excited commotion in the crowd. Xue Tu added, "As for the various leaders and heads, outside of this reward, there are additional rewards based on rank. The least is three Australian dollars! The most is thirty blocks!"

Now the tense faces of the participating representatives all relaxed. Not only did they relax, but they also bloomed with joy. One name was two Australian dollars. They had at least one or two hundred disciples and followers; at once, they could pocket several hundred yuan. Swallowing half of this gracious reward could still be considered acting with conscience. As for the gracious reward given to them personally, it counted for nothing in comparison. Some people secretly regretted why they hadn't forged a few more names on the roster, so they could have made much more money now. Those with active minds secretly hid the roster, deciding to falsely claim they hadn't brought it and would return to fetch it before collecting the silver dollars. They could simply forge another copy...

Originally, the sect leaders who came to the meeting were somewhat unwilling. Firstly, they feared their power would be annexed by Xue Tu. Secondly, anti-Kun activities carried enormous risks. Now, with shining white silver dollars brought before their eyes, a rush of hot blood went to their heads, and every one of them scrambled to express their loyalty, willing to "smear the ground with liver and brains" for the Imperial Court.

Wooden Stone Daoist thought to himself: *All living beings in the world, bustling and hustling, all come for profit and go for profit. rebelling and starting an uprising is nothing more than this! Stone Elder indeed sees clearly from a thousand li away, laying down this setup of silver and money early on. Otherwise, what could be used to incite this group of ignorant villagers?* Seeing the timing was about right, he signaled Xue Tu with a glance, indicating they could proceed to the next step.

Xue Tu understood and immediately announced the start of the alliance ceremony.

Led by Xue Tu, everyone kowtowed to the Heavenly Emperor's shrine. The master of ceremonies at the side chanted loudly: "Everyone present listen clearly. Today the Heaven Gate Daoist Spirit Society reopens the incense hall, admitting all fellow Daoists into the gate. From now on, we are all brothers together, with no more distinction between each other. Entering my Spirit Society, the Heavenly Emperor protects, and disasters disappear forever. If anyone colludes with outsiders to harm brothers, their entire family will be executed. Announced in advance, everyone obey solemnly."

Then he chanted: "Heroes gather from the four seas afar, smearing blood to ally hearts in this friendship. We generation now become sworn brothers together, loyalty and righteousness shining in the nine heavens for a thousand autumns."

After singing a tune, he added, "Those who enter my society must abide by the society rules. Disciples under the gate must not covet wealth and goods, must not bully men and dominate women, must not privately transmit Daoist methods..."

After reading the society rules, he led the crowd to burn incense and pray, burning paper money in the coin-transforming furnace. Various elaborate formalities—offering incense, praying and bowing, swearing brotherhood, arranging ranks. Just the various songs sung numbered more than a dozen. After all the rituals were performed, he led Xue Tu back to his position to accept everyone's congratulations.

Xu Tong bowed along with the crowd while observing carefully. These types of Daoist sects and spirit societies placed the utmost importance on rituals. Through this series of forms, they enhanced their own sense of mystery and majesty. The rituals were accompanied by various spell performances and divine techniques, giving the participating members a strong physiological and psychological shock. At the same time, relying on various myths and superstitious legends, they hypnotized and brainwashed the believers, making them blindly worship the Daoist sect, thereby achieving the ultimate goal of controlling the believers.

The various rituals finally ended. After tossing about for half the day, everyone was already exhausted and hungry. Xue Tu ordered "Open the banquet," and minions laid out various wine and food like flowing water. Not long after, cups and plates were exchanged in the courtyard, and the cups and trays were messy. The field was noisy and chaotic with shouting and drinking games.

Xu Tong held a wine cup and toasted people with Li Baiqing from time to time, but he was only going through the motions and did not truly drink wine. He had to remain awake and alert at all times. Alcohol would lower his insight and self-control. His gaze cautiously observed the surroundings. He neither spoke nor asked questions, nor did he do anything that might arouse others' suspicion. He only carefully checked and listened, but failed to notice a figure secretly following behind him.

Suddenly, a loud shout came from behind Xu Tong: "Wang Jiangchen, what are you doing here?"

Xu Tong's heart jumped fiercely. Wang Jiangchen was the full name of the alias "Mr. Wang" Xu Tong used in Guangzhou. Xu Tong had performed two missions in Guangzhou under this name. Xu Tong did not turn his head immediately, but turned his gaze behind him along with everyone else. A burly man of twenty-eight or twenty-nine stood there behind Xu Tong, staring at him with burning eyes. Xu Tong first scanned the surroundings before confirming that the person was indeed calling him. He replied blankly, "Were you calling me?"

The man sneered, "I was calling you, Wang Jiangchen."

Xu Tong was stunned for a moment and said, "Eh? This brother, you and I do not know each other. What advice do you have?"

The man shouted, "Wang Jiangchen, are you still going to play dumb?"

Xu Tong shook his head. "This brother, my humble surname is Li, given name Jian. I just arrived in Guangzhou Prefecture not long ago. Presumably, you have mistaken me for someone else."

The man was stunned. Xu Tong denied it to the death, and he indeed had no evidence. Moreover, very few people had seen this Wang Jiangchen, and there were no other witnesses, which made him feel somewhat tricky.

Aside, Li Baiqing stepped forward and said loudly, "Sun Gang, are you ruining someone's innocence out of thin air? My cousin-nephew Li Jian got into a lawsuit in Jiangnan and fled to my place to avoid the wind. What, how does that concern you?"
