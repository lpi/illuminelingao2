# Chapter 2682: The Capital (Part 34)

With the support of a "cheat" for more than a year, Wang Yehao had now successfully sat on the top chair of the Office of Transmission, ranking as one of the Nine Ministers. The Office of Transmission controlled the submission and sealing of memorials from inside and outside the capital. Whether it was transmitting imperial orders, communicating conditions from below, handling official documents from various offices, or suggestions from all quarters, everything gathered here. It could be said to be the most well-informed government office in the court. Therefore, the seasonal gifts and relationship-building fees from officials everywhere inevitably included a share for this place.

When the Eunuch Party was in power, the authority of the Office of Transmission was greatly reduced, and the Document Office of the Directorate of Ceremonial actually replaced its position. Since the current Emperor ascended the throne, the Office of Transmission restored its former status. Wang Yehao's status also rose with the tide.

However, a "meager gift" sent to the residence today by Wang Zunde, the Viceroy of Liangguang, put Wang Yehao in a bit of a difficult position. It wasn't that Wang Yehao had clean sleeves [was incorruptible] and dared not reach out, but because the item listed on the gift list was "Australian Treasures."

He remembered Liu Zhao and Zhou Lezhi returning from Guangzhou and mentioning the Hearthstone Immortal's strange reaction after seeing "Australian goods," and also saying the Immortal told Master Gao that he was also an Australian and tried to find these overseas merchants.

From this view, even if this Immortal Zhou wasn't an "Australian," he at least had a great connection with this group of overseas merchants.

"Go call Liu Zhao and Zhou Lezhi. Avoid Mr. Zhou." Wang Yehao thought back and forth and was still a bit unsure, so he instructed Wang Liang to find people to confirm. "Wait, call Liu Sha over too."

Because Liu Zhao mixed most familiarly with Mr. Zhou, he was arranged to continue serving in the Zhou household after returning to the capital, openly as a guard but actually for close surveillance. Added to the student Zhou Lezhi, the attendant Wang Zhi, and the room-sharing maid Jieyi, Master Wang had practically arranged undercover agents for Hearthstone Daoist inside and out, on the bed and off the bed. It was basically 24-hour all-around monitoring with no dead angles.

Mr. Zhou was not only unaware but also quite satisfied with such an arrangement. After all, in this spacetime lacking modern entertainment activities, having two people who could relatively chat with him was better than facing a room-sharing maid who didn't recognize even a few big characters every day. Currently, he had successfully reproduced epoch-making pastimes such as *Dou Dizhu* [Fight the Landlord], UNO, and Aeroplane Chess, and was setting out to develop high-tech card games like *Sanguosha* [Legends of the Three Kingdoms].

That night, Liu Zhao, Zhou Lezhi, and Liu Sha gathered in the study as appointed. Wang Yehao prioritized confirming the confidentiality of the matter: "You coming out so late, did Mr. Zhou suspect anything?"

"Master rest assured. The whole residence is our people; guaranteed to hide it deadly tight." Liu Zhao replied with a smile. "At this moment, Mr. Zhou should be tossing about Jieyi. After tossing, he will fall asleep and won't wake up until the sun is three poles high."

"What if he doesn't sleep?"

"This small one put some mood-enhancing medicine in his tea—only he will be even more tired afterwards."

"You indeed have some means." Wang Yehao stroked his beard with satisfaction, suddenly thinking of a question. "Speaking of which, why is there still no movement in Jieyi's belly? Go back and remind her; if there is still no joy [pregnancy], the main wife won't be her."

"Okay, subordinate knows what to do." Liu Zhao nodded in promise, looking at Wang Yehao waiting for further instructions.

"This Official called you here today to identify some things." Wang Yehao opened the gift box on the desk as he spoke and asked, "Are these Australian objects?"

By the light in the room, several crystal-clear glass fruit plates appeared before everyone's eyes. Liu Zhao examined them carefully for a long time, then said somewhat uncertainly: "Master, subordinate indeed hasn't seen such glazed glass vessels in the Gao Family shop before. However, subordinate only went once; Zhou Lezhi should have seen more."

"Reporting to the Master, this small one hasn't seen them either." Zhou Lezhi continued Liu Zhao's words. "The Gao Family shop has many rare goods, but indeed never sold such things. But it's hard to say; maybe they hid good goods and didn't sell them loose. However..." He hesitated for a moment and said, "They indeed look very like the goods in the Gao Family shop!"

While everyone couldn't get the main point, Liu Zhao suddenly frowned: "No, this isn't the Gao Family shop's thing. Look, there are words on the bottom of this plate, 'Purple Treasure Studio' [*Zi Zhen Zhai*]!"

Wang Yehao hurriedly took out the other vessels to check; without exception, all had such stamps.

"Have you seen this shop in Guangzhou Prefecture?" Wang Yehao asked, rubbing the stamp on the bottom of the plate.

"Subordinate has not seen it. The whole Guangzhou city knows that Australian goods are sold exclusively by the Gao Family shop, with absolutely no branches." Liu Zhao said very decisively.

"Since Australian goods are only sold in the Gao Family shop, and the stamp isn't the Gao Family shop's, then these are not Australian objects?" Liu Sha on the side listened for half a day and asked somewhat confusedly.

"Master, forgive this small one for speaking too much; these items indeed have extraordinary points." Liu Zhao expressed a different opinion. "Although subordinate is low in position, I have seen good things when on duty in the *Zhenfusi*. Dare I ask if the Master has ever seen such transparent glazed glass cups before?"

"Indeed haven't seen."

"Let alone that the patterns and dimensions of these glazed glass cups don't differ a hair, just looking at the stamp underneath, it isn't something ordinary craftsmen can make." Liu Zhao paused and said in a deep voice, "In my humble opinion, these glazed glass cups must be foreign goods undoubtedly."

"Even ordinary foreign glazed glass vessels are not like this." Zhou Lezhi lived in the suburbs of Guangzhou since childhood and had been to Guangzhou city, having seen barbarians and foreign goods.

"So speaking, perhaps that Australian sea merchant has returned?" Wang Yehao agreed with Liu Zhao's analysis. Moreover, Wang Zunde was just sending some daily human relations gifts; there was no need to lie to him about the origin.

"Subordinate dares not speak rashely. Should we ask Mr. Zhou? Perhaps he has seen them." Liu Zhao suggested tentatively.

"No. If he knows about this, he will definitely want to go to Guangzhou to find people again. We can't let him run away now." Wang Yehao rejected decisively. "Do not mention today's matter to him."

"This small one understands!" The two were about to withdraw when Wang Yehao said: "Brother Zhou stay a moment."

Because Zhou Lezhi counted as Hearthstone Daoist's disciple, Wang Yehao was quite polite to him on the surface.

"How is your study with Mr. Zhou going?"

Almost every time Zhou Lezhi saw Wang Yehao, he would urge homework; it could be considered an old tune played often.

He quickly said: "This small one studies diligently every day. As long as the Teacher teaches, whether I can do it or not, this small one remembers and memorizes it first, then asks for advice when the Teacher is free."

"Doesn't matter what you study," he asked. "You have studied for a year; do you understand one or two of his skills?"

"The Teacher's skills are vast as the ocean; this small one only learned fur."

"En, what he teaches you is mostly arithmetic and *Gewu*, useful but also of no great use—it seems he is unwilling to teach you true skills." Wang Yehao sighed.

Zhou Lezhi's neck felt cold; the meaning in these words seemed very dissatisfied with him.

Once useless, what would be the result? He knew even thinking with his toes.

He quickly defended: "The Master doesn't know; what Mr. Zhou teaches me are all secret studies learned from overseas. Once learned, one has the ability to connect heaven and understand earth. Only this secret study has three major foundations; one must learn them first before learning the secret study..."

"Oh? There is such a thing?" Wang Yehao was half-doubting. "What three major foundations?"

"One is arithmetic, two is *Gewu*, the third is Logic..."

Wang Yehao didn't know what "Logic" was and was half-doubting Zhou Lezhi's words. Because he didn't understand, he couldn't question it, so he could only sneer to express "everything is under control."

Seeing the Master's smile, Zhou Lezhi was even more frightened and hurriedly said: "The Teacher also taught me many administrative gains and losses of past dynasties, and also said..." Speaking here, he felt it seemed inappropriate, so he shut his mouth.

"Also said what?" Wang Yehao pursued.

"The gains and losses of this Dynasty..." Zhou Lezhi stammered. "Words are mostly arrogant and contrary; this small one dares not relay."

This actually didn't exceed Master Wang's expectation. With his precise prediction of the court situation, it was only natural to make piercing comments on court politics.

"What did he say?" Wang Yehao slowed his tone. "Just speak; only you and I are here!"

"He said, he said: Although the Great Ancestor of this Dynasty drove out the Tartars and restored China, in reality, except for clothing and writing, the old institutions of Tang and Song were all forgotten; instead, many evil policies of Jin and Yuan were inherited..."

Wang Yehao listened to his rambling and was secretly surprised. Although these words were mostly unstructured fragments, and some were biased or absurd, many criticisms were things he had thought of or heard others mention when reading in the past.

"Although arrogant and contrary, it doesn't lack some penetrating insight." Wang Yehao said, "After you go back, write these all down and hand them to me every month."

"Yes."

"Study well. In the future, his mantle will be yours."

"Thank the Master for cultivation!" Zhou Lezhi was startled and then delighted.

Sending away Zhou Lezhi, Wang Yehao instructed Liu Sha again: "You go to Guangzhou Prefecture quickly. Investigate the background of this 'Purple Treasure Studio' and the Australians."

"Subordinate departs tomorrow." After accepting the item, Liu Sha said somewhat doubtfully, "Only why didn't the Master let Liu Zhao or Zhou Lezhi go? After all, they are more familiar with the place."

"They have to stare at Hearthstone; can't let him get suspicious."

"Master, subordinate knows I shouldn't ask what shouldn't be asked, but exactly how capable is this Mr. Zhou to require such guarding?"

"Is the Daoist Master eyeing his house with envy?" A trace of a smile appeared at the corner of Wang Yehao's mouth, but it made Liu Sha's back cold.

"Subordinate dares not." Liu Sha denied hurriedly.

"Has the Daoist Master read *A New Account of the Tales of the World* [*Shi Shuo Xin Yu*]?"

"Forgive subordinate's shallowness; haven't read it."

Wang Yehao got up and walked to the bookshelf, fumbled for a while, took out one volume, opened it, and read unhurriedly: "Wei Wu [Cao Cao] had a singing girl. Her voice was the most pure and high, but her temperament was cruel and evil. Wanting to kill her, he loved her talent; wanting to keep her, he couldn't stand her. So he selected a hundred people to be taught at the same time. After a short time, there was another person whose voice reached hers, so he killed the one with evil nature."

After reading this passage, Wang Yehao pulled out a page copied earlier from the desk belly and gave it to Liu Sha. "On this trip to *Guangli*, seek high men everywhere along the way. If you can decode this talismanic spell, this Official won't need that Rough Stock anymore."
