# Chapter 2533: On the Road to Guangzhou

To pass the boring travel time, Zhang Xiao and Lin Motian discussed the situation in Nanhai County all the way. Unknowingly, it was mealtime, and the "grumbling" sounds from their stomachs reminded the two they should go to the dining room. Walking on the deck, they met a young man of sixteen or seventeen supporting a middle-aged man with inconvenient legs also slowly heading towards the dining room.

"Liu Sixian, why didn't you let your father sit in a wheelchair? The wind and waves at sea are big; falling would be terrible." Lin Motian's original profession was orthopedics; seeing this situation, his occupational disease flared up, afraid the middle-aged man would break a bone from falling.

"Chief Lin, it doesn't matter; I wanted to walk myself. This student has lain down for most of his life. Fortunately, thanks to the Chief's miraculous hands bringing back spring, I had the opportunity to stand up. Just let me walk more in the remaining days, using these legs and feet to measure this great land of rivers and mountains."

The middle-aged man speaking was none other than Liu Dalin. According to modern standards, his age of forty-one was just middle-aged. But by the cognition of Ming people, "Since ancient times, people rarely reach seventy"; more than half of his life had passed. His health had also always been poor, so his speech and movements inadvertently revealed the appearance of an old man.

According to the history of the old timeline, Liu Dalin would have died many years ago by now. However, in this parallel timeline, benefiting from the careful care of modern medicine brought by the Senate, he not only extended his life but also recovered some mobility.

With his health improving and his mood good in recent years, Liu Dalin's face didn't retain too many traces of time, looking younger than ordinary natives.

As the number one native VIP client of Lingao General Hospital, Liu Dalin was very familiar with Senators in the medical sector, and Zhang Xiao was no exception.

Zhang Xiao laughed, "Committee Member Liu, the Government Affairs Yuanyuan was worried that you, with inconvenient mobility, might have an accident traveling on a civilian ship, so they let you take the 'Nemesis' with us to Guangzhou. Wind and rain at sea are unpredictable; how about adding another person to support you?" Saying this, Zhang Xiao was about to support Liu Dalin.

"Can't do that, can't do that... How dare I trouble the Chief!" Liu Dalin felt quite "overwhelmed by favor." Before he could refuse, his other arm was already firmly held by Zhang Xiao.

"Committee Member Liu, if you are polite again, we will have to press you into the wheelchair." Lin Motian laughed.

Liu Dalin could only respond with a helpless smile, letting them settle him into the wheelchair.

After taking a seat, he said, " just now I vaguely heard the two Chiefs discussing Xiqiao Mountain, seeming to have intentions to visit this famous mountain. This student also studied there when I was young. If the two Chiefs don't disdain it, this student can be a guide then."

Zhang Xiao was actually not interested in Xiqiao Mountain, but it was inconvenient to brush off his good intentions to his face, so he perfunctorily said, "Good, definitely if there is time!"

Liu Dalin added, "Not hiding it from the two Chiefs, this old man going to Guangzhou this time, besides participating in the activities of the Guangdong Region Advisory Bureau, was also invited by a fellow graduate (*tongnian*). This fellow graduate has a much deeper connection with Xiqiao Mountain than I do."

"You mean Chen Zizhuang?"

Liu Dalin was slightly stunned but immediately understood: with the Australians' intelligence capabilities, they probably investigated this background clearly long ago.

"The Chief truly sees clearly into every detail; it is indeed Chen Jisheng [Chen Zizhuang]." Liu Dalin answered.

Zhang Xiao nodded. "I know a bit about this person Chen Jisheng. He has talent and principles, and must be loyal to the Ming State. Asking him to come out and serve the Senate is probably impossible."

"The Chief is right; he indeed has some 'ignorance of current affairs.'"

"Ignorance of current affairs isn't necessarily a bad thing. I think Chen Jisheng's character is still okay. If you see him, just pass a message for us: My Great Song's laws are all different from the Ming State. We won't force an invitation on him. Just as long as he contentedly stays a rich man and absolutely doesn't harbor other thoughts."

Zhang Xiao knew that when it came to playing conspiracies and tricks, compared to this group of native human spirits, none of them few hundred modern people were good enough to watch. Since they could crush with strength, what the Senate played was open strategy, so they might as well open the skylight and speak brightly.

Liu Dalin repeatedly said yes. "Will definitely pass it on!"

The Senate Special Ship they rode was steam-powered. To improve the quality of Senators' travel, the ship was equipped with a high-class dining room and even refrigeration equipment produced in Lingao. When the wind was calm, fire could be lit in the ship's galley, allowing Senators to eat fragrant hot meals. Of course, if luck was bad and they encountered big wind and waves, to prevent fire, they could only extinguish the stove in the galley. In this situation, eating cold rice wasn't necessary; using the steam on the steam-powered ship to make some steamed dishes and steamed rice was still a simple matter.

Today, the luck of the "Nemesis" was quite good, with calm wind and waves. The food placed on the table in the high-class dining room included: Double Cooked Pork, Mapo Tofu, Roast Lamb, Roast Duck, Tomato Stewed Beef Brisket, Fuqi Feipian [Sliced Beef and Ox Tongue in Chili Sauce], White Cut Chicken, Potatoes, Smashed Cucumbers, and Fruit Salad.

Liu Dalin was invited by Zhang Xiao to dine at the same table. Over the years, the Senate's actions in Hainan had greatly improved local public security and the lives of common people, gaining Liu Dalin's sincere approval. The Senate also treated him as one of their own.

Liu Sixian was originally going to retreat to a small table to eat. He was still a student now and underage. According to ancient rules, he was not qualified to eat at the table with officials. If this were in the Great Ming, this treatment would be equivalent to dining with the Chongzhen Emperor. However, the Senate never had so much etiquette and let him stay.

Zhang Xiao took a piece of roast duck and said, "Back to the topic just now. As the saying goes, hooligans aren't scary; what's scary is hooligans having culture."

Lin Motian summarized, "That is to say, Nanhai, and even Guangzhou, is a base for stubborn forces. Here, and even elsewhere in Guangzhou, there still exist many independent local military forces. Even though Guangzhou opened its gates bloodlessly at the beginning, a storm of blood is unavoidable later. Just like Li Chengdong entered Guangdong without blood on his blade occupying Guangzhou initially, but later fought repeatedly back and forth in Guangdong and Guangxi for many rounds, and even massacred Guangzhou City once."

"May I ask Chief, who is Li Chengdong? When did he enter Guangzhou?" Liu Dalin listened with a head full of fog, especially hearing the word "massacre," his spine involuntarily chilled.

Lin Motian knew he accidentally slipped his tongue and feigned calmness to ask, "You haven't read the newly released novel? It's that sci-fi novel about a parallel world where the Jin Tartars unified the world in the Pre-Song period. Li Chengdong is the general sent by the Tartars to suppress Guangdong and Guangxi."

"This student has never read novels." Liu Dalin knew it wasn't the case, but he had no intention to get to the bottom of it. He just listened to the two Chiefs talk while eating and spoke no more.

Zhang Xiao finished gnawing on the roast duck and picked up a roast lamb skewer, gnawing while saying, "The complexity of Guangzhou's current situation far exceeds ordinary people's imagination. Without absolute military superiority, wanting to establish a foothold is no different from ascending to heaven. In this background, how to insert the Senate's rule into the grassroots in an area like Nanhai County where feudal forces are exceptionally strong is a massive challenge for anyone. Little Hou is too tender and lacks grassroots experience."

"Isn't this a shortage of cadres? No, accurately speaking, it's a shortage of qualified cadres. We can only let Senators go personally!" Lin Motian drank kvass, burped from his stomach, let out a long breath, and enjoyed the leisure moment, exclaiming, "*Seamen, love their bellies above everything else.*"

Zhang Xiao saw Lin Motian intentionally changing the topic, so he shifted the topic to food. "Current conditions are much better than when we first arrived. I still remember eating Spanish Seafood Paella until I wanted to vomit for a while; smelling that scent gave me psychological shadows. Pity this cook's skill is still far behind Li Mei." Zhang Xiao had some regrets. He and Ming Qiu were fellow provincials from Sichuan. Ming Qiu had now retreated to the second line, so Zhang Xiao caught chances to go to Ming Qiu's house to mooch Sichuan food when in Lingao.

Li Mei was a very busy person and rarely had time to cook at home. However, she trained a very good Sichuan cuisine chef team in the Commercial Hall Restaurant. Every now and then, she would call the chefs to her home to host a "family feast" to entertain Senators, which counted as her way of connecting feelings.

"To be honest, I didn't see you as a person picky about food," Lin Motian said.

"But I reserve the right to evaluate food." Zhang Xiao wiped his hands with a napkin and asked, "Do you know why the Old Lord of Heaven created Sichuan?"

"I don't know." Lin Motian answered honestly.

"That is to create chefs for the world!" Zhang Xiao said confidently, even though he never cooked himself whilst in Lingao.

"Sichuan rats being tasty indeed lives up to the reputation."

"Speaking of which, Sichuan cuisine is authentic commoner food, with extensive ingredients and seasoning that goes well with rice." Zhang Xiao was quite proud. "If you changed to other cuisines, it would be quite hard to replicate in Lingao. After all, ingredients aren't easy to obtain."

"As a doctor, I hold reservations."

"Che! Don't eat if you have the guts!"

When the "Nemesis" docked at the Guangzhou Great World Military Pier, the sedan chair of the Guangzhou Municipal Government was already waiting at the Great World entrance. The Provincial-Port General Hospital was located inside the Guangzhou Great World. Lin Motian bid farewell to everyone and returned to his post. Liu Sixian supported Liu Dalin to go a step ahead to the Region Advisory Bureau.

The one who came to welcome Zhang Xiao was precisely Hou Wenyong. Years earlier, Zhang Xiao had seen him in Ma Qianzhu's office. At that time, Hou Wenyong was just a green kid; now he was in his early twenties.

Zhang Xiao felt somewhat strange about his arrival. "Yi, affairs in Guangzhou are piled up like a mountain now. Little Hou, you should be handling ten thousand machines a day managing Nanhai; why did you come to pick us up?"

Hou Wenyong scratched his head awkwardly. "Chief, Nanhai County is not under my management. Senator Little Zhang was transferred to serve as the Director of the Management Committee of Foshan Economic Development Zone. No one could take over her job as Secretary-General of the Municipal Government. Because I originally did secretarial work, Chief Liu transferred me to replace Senator Little Zhang's post. Now the Magistrate of Nanhai County is concurrently held by Chief Liu himself."
