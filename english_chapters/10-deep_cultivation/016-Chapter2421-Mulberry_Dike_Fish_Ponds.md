# Chapter 2421: Mulberry Dike Fish Ponds

"What's there to 'this' or 'that' about," Shen Su smiled. "Wanting it very much in your heart but insisting you can't with your mouth."

Chen Lin was greatly embarrassed and could only say: "Since that's the case, then I'll trouble you."

"That's more like it. I can't stand you people putting on false airs like that," Li Yao'er said. "It's just home cooking here, nothing special. After eating, there are matters to discuss with you."

She instructed the factory's tea room to bring up lunch. The factory food was simple—big pot rice and big pot vegetables. All local produce was used. The Chen family, although a big household, usually practiced thrift in managing the home and wasn't particular about food.

The food was one serving per person, neither more nor less. During the meal, Li Yao'er asked some more about the local customs, conditions, and products. Chen Lin naturally didn't need to hide anything and told her everything. What Li Yao'er cared most about was expanding the mulberry cultivation area.

"Do you know about Mulberry Dike Fish Ponds?"

Chen Lin looked blank. It turned out that this characteristic agriculture of the Pearl River Delta famous in later generations—the Mulberry Dike Fish Pond system, one of the pioneering ancestors of circular economy—hadn't appeared locally yet.

The so-called Mulberry Dike Fish Pond meant planting mulberry trees on the dikes surrounding fish ponds, using mulberry leaves to feed silkworms, using silkworm excrement (*cansha*), silkworm pupae, and so on as fish feed, and using pond mud as fertilizer for mulberry trees. This formed a production structure or production chain of planting mulberry on pond dikes, raising silkworms with mulberry leaves, feeding fish with silkworm pupae, and fertilizing mulberry with pond mud. The two mutually utilized and promoted each other to achieve the effect of obtaining both fish and silkworms.

This model first arose in the sericulture regions of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The Huzhou Mulberry Dike Fish Pond system that can be verified in later generations originated in the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods. The *Shen's Book of Agriculture* written at the end of the Chongzhen reign recorded: "Fish are kept in ponds; the fertile soil can go on bamboo land, the remainder can be used for mulberry. Fish can be exchanged for rice at year's end; keeping five or six sheep provides the capital for planting mulberry trees"—obtaining economic benefits of "both advantages complete, ten times that of grain crops."

Besides obtaining mulberry leaves for raising silkworms, after spring silkworms ended, the Jiangnan region also used mulberry leaves to raise sheep. The income was even greater.

However, this model was much rarer in Guangdong. The news brought by the "informants" sent by the Agricultural Committee to various parts of the Pearl River Delta disappointed them—the Pearl River Delta was not a region with a very developed sericulture industry as they had conceptualized.

The sericulture industry of the Pearl River Delta had its first great development along with the opening of Macau's port and the large-scale export of raw silk. At that time, because raw silk sold well, places like Jiujiang in Nanhai County, Longshan and Longjiang in Shunde County, and Gulao in Xinhui County all saw large-scale sericulture. Planting mulberry on pond dikes also began to appear in these areas at this time—among which the most famous were the Sangyuan (*Mulberry Garden*) Dike and the Gulao Dike.

However, looking at the entire Pearl River Delta, the overall sericulture industry was not large. Only after consulting the Grand Library did they learn that the sericulture industry of the Pearl River Delta had its second large-scale development starting from the Kangxi era of the Qing Dynasty, along with the dramatic increase in foreign trade volume.

The scale of raw silk and satin trade at the end of the Ming was still very small compared to the Qing era. Britain, this biggest trading partner, had not yet come to China. The countries trading with China were actually only Spain, Holland, and Japan. And the end of the Ming happened to be when Fujian's foreign trade ports were most prosperous. The foreign merchants of Fujian obviously preferred to import goods directly from Jiangnan.

Currently, although the Senate's raw silk trade was considerably more than in history, due to Zhao Yingong's operations in Hangzhou, Jiangnan's silk production and export had increased dramatically compared to the original timeline. Jiangnan's raw silk was not only sufficient to meet the demand for trade with Japan but could also roughly satisfy the needs of the Portuguese and Dutch.

The result was that raw silk production in the Pearl River Delta region was further suppressed. The sericulture farmers in Xiangshan County, who weren't much to speak of originally, naturally had no interest in introducing any new production models.

In other words, Li Yao'er's tinkering with sericulture improvement in Guangdong might not harvest much actual benefit. Especially further increases in raw silk production would probably only cause the export price of raw silk to fall further.

Whether it was necessary to develop sericulture improvement and establish a new silk weaving industry in Guangdong was debated at the joint conference convened by the Planning Agency. The final conclusion was that relevant improvements should continue—after all, upgrading the sericulture industry was something that had to be done, and doing it in Jiangnan had too many inconveniences.

So Chen Lin's response was not beyond her expectations.

"Are there many families raising fish locally?"

"Quite a few." Xiangshan had low-lying terrain with crisscrossing waterways, providing convenient conditions for raising fish. The county had quite a few fish ponds.

"Haven't people thought about planting mulberry trees on the pond dikes?"

This question baffled Chen Lin. The village wasn't without mulberry groves—why plant on the pond dikes? Besides, what use would planting so many mulberry trees be?

"The mulberry leaves from local mulberry groves are already sufficient. If occasionally insufficient, we just buy some from other villages," Chen Lin said. "Otherwise, we just plant a few more..."

In late Ming Guangdong, the land-population contradiction was far less acute than in the Qing Dynasty, and the utilization and refined management of land hadn't yet involution-ed to later levels.

Speaking in fashionable theory terms, the Mulberry Dike Fish Pond system itself was also a manifestation of agricultural involution.

Li Yao'er said to Shen Su: "You come and tell Mr. Lin about the benefits of Mulberry Dike Fish Ponds. This is also to test whether your knowledge is solid."

"I understand." Shen Su answered with a smile.

She looked at Chen Lin, then lowered her gaze. Although today was their first meeting, in this brief contact, her impression of Chen Lin was quite good.

This young man, although from a wealthy family, was modest and polite in attitude, composed and refined in manner and speech, neither servile nor overbearing. Compared to that Chen Xuan who had only an ingratiating smile whenever he saw them but was fierce as evil spirits toward villagers—Chen Lin was much more pleasing to the eye.

Shen Su said: "Mr. Chen, this Mulberry Dike Fish Pond works like this..."

In the entire Mulberry Dike Fish Pond system, after mulberry leaves are harvested, they are used to feed silkworms. The silkworm excrement *cansha* and the silkworm pupae left after reeling are used as fish feed. After fish are harvested from the pond, the thick nutrient-rich silt at the pond bottom is dug out and transported to the surrounding pond dikes as fertilizer for mulberry trees. Because the pond dikes have a certain slope, excess nutrients in the mulberry field soil flow continuously into the fish pond with rainwater runoff. The excess nutrients and waste produced in the cycle are recycled repeatedly within the system, causing no pollution to the ecological environment outside the system, and also saving costs in planting and breeding.

A farming household can coordinate and arrange agricultural activities according to seasonal changes. Generally, in the first and second months, they manage mulberry trees and stock fish fry; in the third and fourth months, they fertilize mulberry trees; in the fifth month, they raise silkworms; in the sixth month, they sell; silkworm pupae are used to feed fish; in the seventh and eighth months, pond silt is dredged, and pond mud is used to strengthen and consolidate pond dikes; in the last few months of the year, weeds are cut to feed fish.

"...If there's spare capacity, you can also pick mulberry leaves to raise sheep, earning even more income. Don't you think this is a viable livelihood?"

Chen Lin carefully pondered her words, thinking *who thought up this method! It's truly brilliant.* He mused: "The method is excellent. But this way, families raising silkworms can only raise fish and would have no spare capacity to farm the land."

"After selling fish and cocoons, would you still worry about having no money to buy grain?" Shen Su said. "In our hometown, just raising silkworms alone is enough for a whole family to have clothing and food without worry..."

"Next, we're going to promote Mulberry Dike Fish Ponds in Nansha," Li Yao'er continued. "This matter will still need you to put in more effort."

"This is a good thing benefiting the country and the people. This small one will naturally put in effort." Chen Lin thought for a moment. Although it was a good thing, at the start of promotion, definitely no one would be willing to do it—it was the same when his father promoted silkworm seeds back then. They'd need to find a household to set an example. When everyone saw there were indeed benefits, they would follow.

He expressed his thoughts. Li and Shen exchanged a glance and smiled. Li Yao'er said:

"You're right! Since ancient times, promoting new crops and new technologies has always required a process. The common people must actually see the benefits. Besides, whether new crops and new technologies are suitable for the local area also needs to be tested first. Otherwise, if they're promoted only to fail, wouldn't that harm a large area?"

"The Chief is far-sighted."

"Learned to flatter so quickly," Shen Su laughed.

"No, no, this small one speaks from the heart." Chen Lin's face reddened again. He hadn't had contact with "Australian-style women" like Li Yao'er and Shen Su before and was very unaccustomed to their undisguised way of speaking.

"My, what thin skin..."

Li Yao'er had no mind to listen to her student tease and interrupted: "Think about it—who in the village would be most suitable to be this demonstration household?"

Chen Lin pondered for a moment, thinking the household first couldn't be wealthy—the wealthy had no motivation to change; second, they needed to have fish ponds; third, the family should also raise silkworms...

Thinking it over, he thought of a suitable candidate.

"Chen Ji's family is most suitable."

Li Yao'er made a gesture, and Shen Su immediately took out a leather-covered notebook from her shoulder bag, flipped it open, searched for a moment, then handed the notebook to her teacher.

Li Yao'er looked at it and seemed to nod in satisfaction. Chen Lin was somewhat puzzled, not knowing what they were looking at.

"Why do you think his family is suitable?" Li Yao'er closed the notebook and asked.

Chen Lin replied: "His family has many children and little land, and life is very tight. His family has fish ponds and also raises silkworms. They're skilled hands at both raising fish and silkworms. As long as he's given some benefits, he'll naturally agree."

"Then what benefits would need to be given before he'd agree?"

"As long as he's promised that no matter what the experiment results are, he'll be given enough grain for his whole family to eat their fill."

"Makes sense. But one family is a bit few—need to find at least three or four more."

Chen Lin racked his brains and thought of a few more families. Li Yao'er instructed Shen Su to record all these families.

"We'll go visit these families this afternoon. See the situation—you come along too."

"Yes, this small one will definitely accompany."

Li Yao'er's gaze lingered on him for a moment, then suddenly asked: "I heard you have a younger sister?"

"Yes, my humble sister Chen Yue." Chen Lin thought this Chief's questions really jumped around unpredictably!

"Is she your blood sister?"

"She was originally Second Uncle's daughter. Later the clan decided to have her adopted by my late father as his daughter."

"Your Second Uncle has no heirs—why would he give his only daughter to your father to adopt?" Li Yao'er had always been interested in this question. Because Chen Xuan had mentioned this matter in the past, always gnashing his teeth, saying it was Chen Lin's father and others persecuting him, wanting to make him all alone.
