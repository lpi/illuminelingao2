# Chapter 2490: Stripping the Cocoon (Part 5)

Liang Yuanfu seemed to move slightly, but still didn't say a word.

Xu Tong continued: "When one person achieves the Dao, of course, his chickens and dogs ascend to heaven. Steward Liang, these years, your family has been majestic enough in Guangzhou."

Liang Yuanfu's heart trembled, and his body shivered. *When one person achieves the Dao, chickens and dogs ascend to heaven. What if one person loses power? How should the chickens and dogs handle themselves? Majestic enough... that means the majesty has come to an end.* Thinking of this, Liang Yuanfu's heart was in chaos.

Seeing his body tremble slightly and his facial muscles twitch, Xu Tong thought: *There's a way!*

Initially, the method they envisioned for "pulling out" was "buying gratitude." The selected development targets all had various weaknesses to target. But after querying the specific situations of these targets, they found that relying on buying gratitude couldn't achieve the goal.

The Liang family's "grace" to these people exceeded several generations. It could be said that generations had served under the Liang family "receiving grace." There were not only deep interest bindings but also a massive load of human favor. It wasn't something a few words or petty favors from the Senate could buy. Even a life-saving grace now couldn't outweigh the Liang residence's "accumulated generational grace."

Since they couldn't be made to "receive grace," then they could only do the opposite.

No matter how big or good the ship of the Liang family was, when facing the risk of sinking, probably not too many would be willing for the whole family to perish with the master. Especially those who had grabbed a lot of benefits and had their own small boats.

Xu Tong said slowly: "Steward Liang, when our Australian Song first arrived, the Liang residence extended a helping hand repeatedly. We are grateful from the bottom of our hearts. Now, the Senate reigns over Guangzhou. My Australian Song naturally won't forget old friends, but this old friend seems not to welcome us. Yet we have never made things difficult for the Liang residence. Why? Because we still cherish old feelings; we are still giving him a chance; we are still hoping he turns back. But opportunity is fleeting, and the door won't stay open forever."

At this point, Xu Tong lightly raised his left hand, flashing his index and middle fingers. Yu Laosan saw this and immediately took out a pack of "Holy Ship" from his chest, pulled one out, placed it between Xu Tong's two fingers, struck a match to light it, waved his hand to extinguish the lingering flame, and quietly retreated out again.

Xu Tong gently exhaled a mouthful of white smoke. His face gradually faded into the diffusing smoke. Liang Yuanfu couldn't see his expression clearly, which made him appear unfathomable and elusive.

Xu Tong continued: "As the inner courtyard manager, Steward Liang is deeply trusted by Young Master Liang and presumably relied upon for many things. I, Australian Song, have a saying: power and responsibility are one. Having held power, you naturally have to bear the sin. Presumably, as the inner courtyard steward, you know a thing or two about what the Liang residence has done in recent years. You can weigh the severity of the matters yourself. If there are unspeakable things, your Liang family naturally is involved. You should know that walls cannot block the wind. Was the sorcery and evil spirits incident a while ago really just about those few clowns in the front? Anti-Song speech has secretly flourished in Guangzhou recently; who is adding fuel to the fire? Connecting with gentry in the four countrysides, spying on Australian Song political and military affairs—what is the intention? You know what kind of crime these things constitute under the Usurper Ming. I just don't know how many heads the protagonist of this grand finale will use to fill this deep pit when the time comes?"

Pausing slightly, Xu Tong continued: "The Liang residence has deep benevolence and righteousness toward your family, but is it really worth the future of your family's three generations and dozens of people? Steward Liang is benevolent and filial; presumably, you cannot bear to see your old mother worrying about her descendants on her sickbed. Moreover, right now the Liang residence's evil deeds aren't manifest, and they haven't cast a big mistake yet. Even if incidents occur, there is room for maneuver. Although scattering wealth and breaking the family is unavoidable, we won't go to extremes. My Australian Song has always separated merit and demerit. Considering past contributions and face, we definitely won't effect mass imprisonment and extensive implicating. Speaking of which, this counts as Steward Liang helping the Liang residence rein in at the precipice, fulfilling the benevolence and righteousness of the Liang residence, and preserving the inheriting bloodline for the Liang residence. Since ancient times, wealth doesn't fight power. Don't wait until things are irreversible to make a decision. By then, killing, slicing, or keeping alive probably won't be up to you."

Liang Yuanfu's back was soaked wet. The corner of his lowered silk robe trembled slightly. He opened his mouth, seeming to want to say something, but in the end, didn't say a single word.

Xu Tong stared fixedly at Liang Yuanfu and said: "If Steward Liang understands the greater righteousness, my Australian Song naturally won't treat you unfairly. Whatever conditions you have, Steward Liang may state them clearly."

Liang Yuanfu dodged Xu Tong's gaze. After a long time, he finally stammered: "My Liang family has been servants to the Liang residence for generations, relying on the Liang residence. If, if really... what will be our livelihood in the future?"

A slight smile appeared at the corner of Xu Tong's mouth. He softened his tone: "Three conditions. One, retain all your family's private property; past evil deeds will not be prosecuted. Two, give your Liang family one management position and one ordinary position in the Sanitation Bureau with formal establishment; duties can be assumed after training. Although the monthly money isn't much, it is truly imperial grain. Three, all drugs needed for your mother's treatment will be provided free of charge—I tell you, the root of this malaria isn't easy to remove; one must take it for a period to cut the root."

Liang Yuanfu hesitated: "This, this is only two positions. My Liang family has dozens of people up and down..."

Xu Tong suddenly snorted coldly and said sternly: "Steward Liang, you must recognize your current situation. Could it be that after this matter, you still want to live that life of ordering slaves and maids, wearing brocade and eating jade? Don't forget you are atoning for crimes with merit; don't push your luck!"

Liang Yuanfu shuddered and fell silent again.

Xu Tong stood up slowly, walked to Liang Yuanfu's side, and said: "Steward Liang, my Australian Song has a little story. I will tell it to you today."

Liang Yuanfu looked at Xu Tong with blank eyes, dazed and confused.

Xu Tong said in a deep voice: "One day, two hunters entered the mountain to hunt. Halfway up the mountain, they suddenly heard a tiger roar in the forest. One hunter threw down his heavy load, turned, and fled. The other hunter saw this and said, 'There is only one path down the mountain. The tiger is fast while man is slow. Being caught up is only a matter of time. What use is fleeing like that?' The fleeing hunter said while running, 'I don't need to run faster than the tiger; I just need to be faster than you.'"

After finishing the story, Xu Tong slowly bent down and whispered in Liang Yuanfu's ear: "Steward Liang, obviously, you are not running fast."

Liang Yuanfu jerked his head up, staring blankly at Xu Tong. His heart violently cracked open. He suddenly understood that actually, whether he spoke or not, or even whether there was evidence or not, didn't really matter. It wouldn't have the slightest impact on the outcome of this matter. But once he lost his value of utilization or failed to defect in time before the Liang residence incident occurred, he and his family would inevitably fall into an abyss of eternal damnation.

Liang Yuanfu seemed to be carrying an invisible mountain. His body bent lower and lower like a cooked shrimp. Cold sweat streamed down his face, accumulating into a small puddle by his feet.

Xu Tong stopped looking at Liang Yuanfu, calmly sat back in his seat, picked up the tea bowl, took a gentle sip, and waited quietly.

Liang Yuanfu's inner heart was in a violent battle between heaven and man, but the inertia of long-term master-servant distinction made his lips tremble, and he stammered subconsciously: "Man, man cannot be ungrateful... I, I..."

Xu Tong was silent for a moment, then suddenly slammed the covered tea bowl hard onto the table. *Dong!* The lid jumped high and fell onto the table surface, spinning like a top. The hot water in the tea bowl splashed out at once, wetting Xu Tong's sleeve and also soaking Liang Yuanfu's robe front.

Liang Yuanfu looked at Xu Tong like a fool. At this moment, Yu Laosan walked in quickly, wiping Xu Tong's sleeve with a handkerchief. But Xu Tong didn't even glance at Liang Yuanfu, only saying viciously: "Thing that doesn't know good from bad!" With that, he strode towards the courtyard without looking back.

Yu Laosan shouted loudly at Liang Yuanfu: "Steward Liang, do you really want to be wrong to the end?"

Liang Yuanfu suddenly woke up, rushed over, crawled a few steps on his knees, and hugged Xu Tong's thigh. Snot and tears smeared all over his face as he hissed: "Mr. Wang don't go, don't go. This lowly one, this lowly one agrees. Only beg Mr. Wang to leave a path of life for this lowly one's whole family of old and young. This lowly one will never dare to forget Mr. Wang's great grace and virtue." After saying this, he kowtowed incessantly. Xu Tong stopped, helped Liang Yuanfu up, and said: "Steward Liang, no need for this." Then he signaled Yu Laosan with his eyes. Yu Laosan immediately stepped forward, supported Liang Yuanfu's other armpit, and helped him walk slowly towards the room, comforting him as they walked: "Steward Liang, why make yourself suffer like this? From now on, we are all one family. One family won't speak two families' words. For one's own brothers, everything can be discussed."

After Liang Yuanfu took his seat and his emotions stabilized slightly, Xu Tong said gently: "Tell me casually about the Liang residence's matters first." After speaking, he snapped his fingers at the courtyard. A member of his entourage quickly walked into the room, took out a notebook and a fountain pen from his chest pocket, sat in the lower seat, and began to record.

Liang Yuanfu looked somewhat withered. After a while, he finally began to confess in a low voice: "Since cannonarding Guangzhou, Young Master Liang has sent people to secretly compile a book called *Record of Broad Knowledge of Heaven's Affairs* (Tian Qing Guang Wen Lu). I don't know how many volumes this book has, but I guess there is at least a whole big book chest. He never uses Guangzhou clerks to compile this book, only sending people to recruit scholars from refugees from other places. After carefully checking their backgrounds, he selects those with clean and reliable backgrounds to transfer to the Guangzhou residence. After a year or two, these clerks and their whole families are sent back to their original registered residences for settlement. There is no news or contact from these people afterward. This book is never shown to others, and I have never seen it; I only vaguely heard him mention it..."

"Young Master Liang has several close relatives and friends in the Yuyuan Society. This lowly one once heard him say that this would be his literary foundation for the future..."

"A while ago, the Young Master stayed overnight at an outer residence. At night, I heard him seemingly talking to someone in his room, but the strange thing is I never saw anyone enter or leave the door..."

Two hours later, Xu Tong stopped the questioning. He walked behind Liang Yuanfu, patted his shoulder gently, and whispered: "See, it wasn't that hard, was it?"

After speaking, he said to Yu Laosan: "Fetch a basin of water and let Steward Liang wipe his face."

Liang Yuanfu raised his head. He had never felt the sunlight so glaring. The pale light made him feel waves of dizziness, as if the whole world had turned upside down. He supported himself on the wall, walked out of the courtyard door with stumbling steps. His desolate back figure went further and further away, as weak and helpless as an old man in his declining years.
