# Chapter 2593 - Investigation (Part 16)

Zheng Xiaoyu's successful "fall into corruption" greatly encouraged Lu Cheng and the others. Now the investigation team had grasped two breakthrough points: one was Bailing Tang, the other Jubao Tang. The team inferred they were likely the head and tail of this ring. Bailing Tang was responsible for gathering drug sources, while Jubao Tang handled distribution.

Their inference was soon partially confirmed. From a medicine peddler secretly arrested while frequenting Jubao Tang, the team recovered various drugs. Not only did the Lushi Powder contain compound ingredients, but several other medicines also contained substances not derived from traditional medicinals. When sent to Zheng Xiaoyu for identification, he too was shocked.

Besides certain biochemically synthesized antibiotic preparations, he'd detected opium components in multiple medicines.

Opium was a powerful sedative with potent analgesic, antitussive, and antidiarrheal effects. In the old timeline, it once had a "miracle drug" reputation and was badly abused. However, because it genuinely worked, it had long been a controlled substance.

The various preparations the Senate produced from Indian-sourced opium as pharmaceutical raw material were under the same controls—with strict regulations on usage scope and dosage. But now, it had been detected in multiple medicines sold by this peddler.

As a health school graduate, he naturally knew what this meant. Lu Cheng immediately reported the situation to Zheng Mingjiang by telegram.

Receiving the telegram, Zheng Mingjiang had somewhat expected the forged prescriptions and false drug claims. But clearly things weren't that simple. This wasn't just an "Australian drug" leakage problem—it also involved controlled substance abuse.

Opium's introduction and addiction problems allegedly began in the Ming dynasty. Its medicinal properties were possibly already known to a few at the time, just not widely—hence no abuse phenomenon had emerged.

"How strange—who's been spreading these secrets?" Zheng Mingjiang felt this was even more serious than "Australian drug" leakage.

"Send Lu Cheng a telegram." Zheng Mingjiang told Guo Huiwen. "Tell Lu Cheng not to rush to close the net—let out more line to catch the big fish. Especially clarify where the drug channel source is."

Lu Cheng subsequently sold a batch of prescription forms with recorded serial numbers to He Jun through Zheng Xiaoyu. Then came silent surveillance of where these prescriptions would go.

The peddler the investigation team caught was surnamed Qian and didn't have much intelligence, but from his mouth, Lu Cheng did learn how this network operated.

According to Peddler Qian's confession, all these peddlers sourced from Jubao Tang. There were about ten types of "miracle drugs," mainly for reducing swelling, relieving pain, suppressing coughs, and stopping diarrhea—some more effective, some less.

By trade conventions, though peddlers were small-scale operators, once they'd "established business relations" (long-term cooperation), pharmacies would give them credit limits. If not settling at three festivals, at least overlapping payments. But Jubao Tang's drugs were never sold on credit—always cash.

Cash on delivery aside, prices were quite expensive. However, Jubao Tang had one policy: once someone's sales reached a certain level, they'd receive one to ten percent "rebates." But simultaneously, if monthly sales couldn't reach a certain level, they'd no longer sell to you.

Under this incentive, all peddlers seeking greater profits transported medicines far away to wholesale to other peddlers, earning the price difference and rebates—essentially becoming wholesalers.

Under Lu Cheng's team's questioning, they learned that Peddler Qian alone purchased several hundred yuan worth monthly. One could imagine how large Jubao Tang's business was.

Because Australian drugs were effective and business was booming, many peddlers and merchants wanted a piece. Though Jubao Tang selling Lushi Powder was no secret, not everyone could buy. You needed two "established business" peddlers' recommendations as guarantors to buy genuine "Australian drugs."

No wonder when they'd sent someone to buy, the product didn't match—there was a procedure. Lu Cheng thought Jubao Tang certainly had business acumen.

"What's Jubao Tang's owner's background?"

"I've heard he's surnamed Quan. Mr. Quan is also local, originally also in the pharmacy business."

This "Mr. Quan" was named Quan Youde. From his grandfather's generation, the family had been active at this medicine market. But they weren't "pharmacy operators"—they were broker-middlemen.

Of course, his family's broker role couldn't compare to the "official brokers" at county seats, prefectural cities, or major land and water docks, lording over merchants with their "broker licenses." To broker at the Grotto Heaven medicine market required judgment no less sharp than professional drug merchants, plus the ability to predict market fluctuations.

The Quan family had painstakingly operated at the Grotto Heaven medicine market for three generations, building some reputation. In Quan Youde's generation, though his pharmaceutical knowledge was inferior to his father and grandfather, he was eloquent and well-connected—quite influential at the medicine market.

Quan Youde had been selling "Lushi Powder" for nearly a year now. Originally, he had no storefront, but as business grew, he opened Jubao Tang. Of course, he never admitted it contained "Australian drugs"—only claimed he'd obtained a "proven formula" from overseas people, which he'd formulated himself.

"...Actually, everyone at the medicine market knows his shop has no self-made medicines. Everything's obtained from various pharmacies, just repackaged. The secret is Australian drugs from who-knows-where..."

Seeing Peddler Qian had nothing new to offer, Lu Cheng ordered him temporarily detained and instructed her subordinates:

"Tomorrow send two people to follow him. Have him continue selling medicine as usual. Don't cut off the wholesale channel and alert them."

Though Zheng Xiaoyu had made breakthrough progress with He Jun, his work hadn't advanced much. Despite secretly selling two prescription pads per his sworn brother's request and receiving fifty yuan compensation, in the month or so since, He Jun hadn't requested more prescription forms.

This was strange. According to his account, using several hundred forms monthly was easy. Had they not even used fifty? Or did they have other channels obtaining more prescription forms?

Zheng Xiaoyu was secretly anxious, but he vaguely sensed He Jun wasn't a core member of the ring—probably just one channel for obtaining drugs. Completely acting on orders. Even if he asked, he probably wouldn't get useful answers.

Moreover, they were only "sworn brothers" based on mutual interest. Though they got along well enough normally, there was still a barrier between them. Even if He Jun knew the truth, he might not dare tell him.

As the investigation stalled, his heart grew anxious. Though Zheng Mingjiang hadn't said anything and the investigation team hadn't obtained other major leads, he still felt uneasy, fearing Elder Zheng would consider him useless—earning an evaluation of "talks big, lacks ability."

But he couldn't proactively approach He Jun, lest he reveal flaws. He could only silently await developments.

Lu Cheng's side was equally anxious. Especially regarding Jubao Tang—after Yuan Shuzhi went in, no other news had come out. And this Jubao Tang, though seemingly ordinary, actually had extremely tight internal and external security. Non-regular customers and outside merchants could only enter the storefront—advancing even an inch further was impossible.

Though she could turn the captured Peddler Qian and use various "connections" at the Grotto Heaven medicine market, even if these people got in, they couldn't contact Yuan Shuzhi. Even if he obtained useful information, he couldn't transmit it in time. The only option was intensifying surveillance of Jubao Tang.

Yuan Shuzhi's current mood matched theirs—burning with anxiety.

The longer he kept accounts at Jubao Tang, the clearer it became that this shop had problems. But he had no way to notify the outside investigation team about these potential issues. At Jubao Tang, he might as well be in prison. Good food, good drink, good sleep every day. They even sent him a woman weekly for "entertainment." But besides that, he couldn't even leave the courtyard. Whether the "manager" who occasionally appeared, the "assistant" constantly by his side, or the "woman" who appeared weekly—none ever said an extra word. Yuan Shuzhi might be thick-skinned as a city wall, smooth-talking, someone who "could make conversation even with a rock," but facing them, no matter what he said, he only received cold expressions.

"I've really entered the tiger's den and wolf's lair this time!" Yuan Shuzhi murmured.

Having lived over fifty years, his social experience was quite seasoned. He knew Jubao Tang's owner must be engaged in something shady. What passed through his hands was all important secrets. As for what shady business—that was easy to guess: the fake drug case.

Though the ledgers didn't reveal the full picture of the fake drug case, the original running accounts clearly showed how large their business was. Though he didn't dare take notes, his ability to memorize by rote had been honed since childhood. Just the running accounts that had passed through his hands involved amounts exceeding two hundred thousand yuan—a figure terrifying enough to kill.

He did his best making the tax ledgers compliant. Yuan Shuzhi knew that with the Senate's current fiscal and tax capacity in Boluo and Huizhou, no problems would be found in his ledgers—unless an Elder personally led an inspection team. Naturally, Jubao Tang's business wasn't clean; dirty money needed to be "laundered"...

Then recalling how he, a complete stranger, had been actively recruited. The manager had specifically asked about his background, and upon hearing he "had no family burdens," his face had seemingly shown satisfaction...

Thinking this through, Yuan Shuzhi felt his hair stand on end: wasn't this obviously intending to silence him when the time came?
