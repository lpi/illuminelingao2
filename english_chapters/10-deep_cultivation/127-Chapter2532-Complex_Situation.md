# Chapter 2532: Complex Situation

"I understand; factor endowments determine the laws of economic development." Lin Motian looked thoughtful after hearing this. "But she must have a reason for choosing that place."

"I know the reason. To be honest, this also relates to our current situation." Zhang Xiao said, "One is that the Ministry of Agriculture and light industry departments also have plans to establish a cotton textile industry. So her going there actually represents the opinions of these two departments. After all, Xiangshan has a lot of sandy land; growing other things won't work, but growing cotton is passable."

"This is the mindset of 'herding one sheep is herding, herd two sheep is also herding.'" Lin Motian laughed.

"Hehe, our Senate has always had this tone. Always wanting to slap five flies dead with one slap." Zhang Xiao smiled bitterly.

"It's just prone to indigestion."

"Indigestion is certain. Look at our current situation. It's said we took all of Guangdong and Guangxi, creating a miracle. Actually, it can also be said that the human heart is not satisfied like a snake swallowing an elephant; the current situation is unable to advance or retreat." Zhang Xiao sighed. "At the beginning, I was very opposed to starting the Guangdong and Guangxi strategy so early—at least 'turtle' for another four or five years to lay a better foundation in all aspects. We wouldn't be attending to one thing and losing another everywhere like now."

"Turtle-ing naturally has benefits, but also downsides. As for what downsides, some words are inconvenient to say too much." Lin Motian smiled quite implicitly.

"Even if you don't say it, I probably know." Zhang Xiao also smiled. "After all, people are not machines; everyone has selfish motives. Distribution is also a big problem, so, the factions in power are anxious to make the cake bigger."

"It's good that you understand." Lin Motian actually also had opinions on the timing of launching the Guangdong and Guangxi strategy—launching a mainland campaign too early actually significantly diluted the whole set of barely passable health and medical care they had struggled to establish. Not to mention the huge pressure of preventing and treating infectious and endemic diseases that came suddenly after the mainland strategy.

"Enough idle talk. Let me tell you why Xiangshan is very unsuitable." Zhang Xiao said, "The Pearl River Delta is currently still in the process of silting up. The current coastline is very different from four hundred years later. The coastline is roughly in the northern Zhongshan area, which is the Xiangshan of the Ming Dynasty. The Eighteen Sands of the West Sea in northern Zhongshan had all formed into flat fields after the Song Dynasty, while the Sixteen Sands of the East Sea have essentially floated up to become fields by now. However, although there are large areas of sandy flats producing in the range of Xiaolan, Guzhen, Nantou, Henglan, Huangpu, Gangkou, Sanjiao, Minzhong, etc., in the north, residential points are very scarce. Only Xiaolan, Guzhen, Haizhou, Big and Small Huangpu, etc., which are close to the edge and have higher terrain, developed significantly after villages were built in the Song Dynasty. As everyone knows, Mulberry Dike Fish Pond is a labor-intensive production method. Mulberry gardens must be close to silkworm rooms, and cannot be too far from residential points. You know what this means. In addition, the Sixteen Sands of the East Sea is in an area of continuously floating sandy fields, without hills as barriers, and is greatly threatened by salty tides. Most importantly, the sandy fields in this belt are owned by foreign landlords. Powerful families from Panyu, Nanhai, Xinhui, and Shunde counties all go to Xiangshan to occupy arable land, registering their household registration with the land in the aforementioned counties. Although local farmers may have long built dikes for reclamation, landlords and powerful families collude with the government to buy large tracts of floating sand flats at low prices, often designating the land already reclaimed by farmers as ownerless wasteland and seizing it for themselves."

Speaking of this, Zhang Xiao turned the conversation back: "But then again, I can understand why Li Yao'er didn't choose Xiqiao."

"Why? Stop keeping people in suspense."

"Because the Ming person Fang Hao said: 'Xiqiao is not the Xiqiao of Lingnan, but the Xiqiao of the World. Xiqiao is not the Xiqiao of the World, but the Xiqiao of the World of Later Generations'!" Zhang Xiao answered with a serious face.

"The water is very deep? The hole is very big?"

"The depth of the water, the size of the hole—one pot cannot hold it."

In the early years of the crossing, due to his interest, Zhang Xiao assisted Senators like Zhang Haogu and Li Zhuoxian in compiling Ming Dynasty historical materials, so he had a fair understanding of the situation in the Pearl River Delta.

Guangzhou people gathering firewood on Luofu Mountain call it East Qiao, and gathering firewood on Jinshi Mountain call it West Qiao [Xiqiao]. Hence the saying "Southern Yue famous mountains number Two Qiaos." Xiqiao is located in the region where the West River and North River waterways flow. It is a typical Lingnan water village. Within the territory, river networks interlace, with more than ten river creeks totaling over one hundred kilometers in length, connecting villages within the territory into one piece, and accessible externally to Foshan, Guangzhou, and other places. Xiqiao Mountain produces stone materials and tea leaves, marketed far and near through waterways and rural markets. In the Ming and Qing periods, there were a total of seventy-eight rural markets within the whole territory. Even compared with the jurisdiction of Lingao Special City under the Senate's rule, it is not inferior, showing the extraordinary influence of geographical conditions on commercial prosperity.

The economic base determines the superstructure. During the Zhengde and Jiajing reigns, academies and study houses stood in great numbers on Xiqiao Mountain. Among them, the most famous were called the Four Great Academies: Dake Academy and Yunguk Academy founded by Zhan Ruoshui, Shiquan Academy founded by Fang Xianfu, and Sifeng Academy founded by Huo Tao. The four academies flourished due to the advocacy of learning by Fang, Zhan, and Huo. during this period, famous scholars appeared in large numbers in Guangdong, and the four academies became an important place for lecturing and traveling for Guangdong scholar-officials for decades thereafter. Qing scholar Liu Zixiu commented: "When Master Zhan held the lecture seat, people from five directions gathered to ask about their studies. The name of Dake in the mountains almost stood like a tripod with Yuelu and Bailu; hence Xiqiao was called the Mountain of Neo-Confucianism." Fang Xianfu recorded the scene of him comparing notes with Zhan Ruoshui and Huo Tao in Xiqiao in his *Manuscripts Left from Xiqiao*: "Three academies stood like a tripod; the three of us often went back and forth. During the time of lecturing, we cultivated ourselves in seclusion for more than ten years." When Wang Yangming wrote to Zhan Ruoshui, he said: "Shuxian [Fang Xianfu]'s ambition and integrity are far above the vulgar custom. Although I haven't spent much time with Weixian [Huo Tao], I knew he was a loyal and trustworthy man at first sight. But I heard you don't meet often, why? How fortunate for heroes to be born at the same time and in the same place, yet you let time pass in vain and easily lose this great opportunity. This makes people of later generations feel pity for people of later generations!" It is visible how high Wang Yangming's expectation for the three's discussion of learning was, hoping they would cherish the opportunity and gather often to leave an eternal佳话 for the Confucian forest of later generations.

The common characteristics of these people were being masters of Neo-Confucianism and having prominent official careers. Zhan Ruoshui served successively as Minister of Rites, Personnel, and War in Nanjing, founded the "Ganquan School" of Neo-Confucianism, and was called "Learning of Wang and Zhan" together with Wang Yangming's "Yangming Learning." Huo Tao, along with Fang Xianfu and Liang Chu, were collectively called the "Three Grand Secretaries" of Nanhai County in the Ming Dynasty.

Throughout the Ming Dynasty, there were more than 290 official and private academies in Guangdong, far exceeding the sum of the Tang, Song, and Yuan dynasties. Nanhai County alone had eighteen. Although implicated by political struggles in the Ming Dynasty, private academies across the country were banned and destroyed during the Jiajing and Wanli reigns, and the number of academies in Guangdong fell back during the Tianqi and Chongzhen reigns, with the trend of lecturing declining. However, the significance of the existence of academies was to train reserve teams for the feudal ruling class, while also undertaking the role of imperceptibly influencing the people and the whole society, transforming people and guiding customs, and promoting feudal ethics. The academy's regulations, rules, and charters, and even the couplets, stone inscriptions, and plaques of the academy all projected certain values and educational functions, influencing generations of students and people, having a major impact on their personality, morality, and temperament. In the early years of Jiajing, Guangdong Education Commissioner Wei Xiao changed Guanyin Pavilion, Wuxing Temple, Yingzhen Temple, Tianzhu Temple, and Renhuang Temple in Guangzhou Prefecture into five academies: Lianxi, Yichuan, Mingdao, Chongzheng, and Hui'an, worshipping Zhou Dunyi, Cheng Yi, Cheng Hao, and Zhu Xi. The academy's sacrificial activities were open to society. Besides people inside the academy, officials, gentry, scholars, and common people also had opportunities to participate. People of different social classes participating in the academy's sacrificial activities were actually accepting ethical and moral education and the baptism of Confucianism. The influence of academy sacrifice far exceeded the scope of mourning sages and inheriting academics; it can be said to have played a role similar to Western churches.

Guangdong people, who had been deeply influenced by Confucian culture for more than a hundred years in the mid-Ming Dynasty and created their own ideological and cultural traditions, no longer regarded themselves as Southern Barbarians. They could discuss Dao and learning with the top Neo-Confucianists and also exchange poems and songs with literary giants. Accompanying the decline of the trend of lecturing was the rise of the literary trend, with Guangdong poetry societies flourishing. From Jiajing to the late Ming, there were more than ten big and small poetry societies in Guangzhou Prefecture City. Their founders were more or less connected to Xiqiao Mountain, and Xiqiao also became a refuge for Guangdong literati and scholar-officials in later chaotic times.

Another important social change was that starting from the mid-Ming Dynasty, a trend of rural militarization appeared in Guangdong. After the outbreak of Huang Xiaoyang's Uprising, the Ming court could not suppress it and had to seek help from local powerful families. Led by local gentry, some villages and towns quickly formed local military organizations and engaged in a desperate confrontation with Huang Xiaoyang's rebel army. After Huang Xiaoyang's Uprising was suppressed, what followed was the reorganization of local order and the redistribution of local power. The famous Foshan Town stood firmly on the side of the court in this turmoil. As a reward, their deities were titled and worshipped, and the control of local powerful families over the locality was further expanded.

Jiujiang in Nanhai also utilized the danger of mountains and rivers to participate in the suppression of Huang Xiaoyang like Foshan. Huang Xiaoyang attacked Guangzhou unsuccessfully, scattered to loot, and attacked Jiujiang by water. Jiujiang people guarded Li Mountain, Ma Mountain, and Zhen Mountain, defeating him. After Huang Xiaoyang died, Li Mountain was renamed "Zhongliang [Loyal and Good] Mountain," and Jiujiang also received rich rewards. In the first year of Jingtai, Ming Emperor Daizong bestowed Nanhai Jiujiang as "Rulin Xiang" [Confucian Forest Village]. Due to continuous turmoil and rampant bandits, the phenomenon of rural militarization in Guangdong reached its peak at the turn of Ming and Qing. Local villages built walled stockades widely for self-protection, forming the characteristic of "no village without a stockade," greatly enhancing the strength of local armed forces.

The people catching fish fry in the West River were Tanka people. The Ming court forcibly registered them into household registration and levied fish tax rice. However, a large number of Tanka households along the river participated in Huang Xiaoyang's uprising activities. After the failure of the uprising, these Tanka people fled one after another, breaking away from the Ming court's household registration control. By the Hongzhi reign, Tanka households had fled almost completely, and there was no way to collect taxes. In this situation, Vicoroy of Liangguang Liu Daxia received an edict to summon Jiujiang people to contract the fish ports on both banks of the West River, spanning five or six hundred *li* from Fengchuan to Gaoming, with eight or nine hundred fish ports. Since then, Jiujiang villagers monopolized the right to catch fish fry, forming a very large non-governmental force from then on.
