# Chapter 2746: The Capital (Part 98)

The noisy hall fell silent. For an instant, even the faint crackling of charcoal could be heard clearly.

Since learning Shuntian Prefecture would unseal Delong, everyone knew Leng Ningyun would definitely come tonight. Yet even so, their hearts trembled.

This bringer of doom had finally arrived!

Leng Ningyun was fair-skinned and refined in manner, always impeccably polite. Though his accent was somewhat hard to understand, he always spoke calmly and evenly—no one had ever seen him lose his temper.

By all accounts, such a scholarly-looking person should have nothing to do with "doom." But since his safe return, that gentle smile now seemed sinister in memory.

Manager Shen knew this best. He'd thought Leng Ningyun was dead and gone. Even if he returned, he'd be dejected. Never expected him to come back bouncing with life. Not only returned but reopening!

Since he dared reopen, he had cards to play. This was what worried Manager Shen most. Leng Ningyun knew his cards clearly; he knew nothing of Leng Ningyun's.

After all, he had the Short-Hairs behind him!

Leng Ningyun entered the hall and immediately felt the warmth. He smiled. "It's so warm in here!"

The servant smiled ingratiatingly. "The fire's been burning since last night, waiting for you gentlemen!"

Leng Ningyun said, "No wonder there's not a snowflake on the roof—they've all melted." He unfastened his cloak's ties and shrugged his shoulders slightly. The sable-trimmed feather-gauze cloak immediately slid off, caught by a quick-eyed servant who backed out of the room.

One glance showed all eight managers were present. In the past, he'd come with the minor peers, arriving only before nightfall. Today was his first time at the major peers' gathering. He felt a slight satisfaction: The capital's banking landscape would be rewritten from today.

Manager Cao had already risen to greet him. Leng Ningyun hurried to return the gesture. A flurry of greetings and bows followed, exchanging New Year wishes. Then everyone took their seats according to rank.

Servants immediately brought fragrant tea. This tea was neither Longjing nor the Fujian jasmine common in the north but Songluo tea from Korea—the King's own reserve, extremely precious.

The capital's wealthy loved exotic rarities from afar. The pleasure house had certainly gone to great lengths.

Just as they were about to speak, servants brought fruit. Fruit wasn't rare in the capital's winter—it was an ice cellar trade, which had spawned a sideline: cellar fruit.

Fruit merchants purchased large quantities of seasonal fruit, then selected those with intact skins to store in ice cellars. In winter, they'd bring them out to sell at several times the profit. But these were mostly hardy fruits like native apples, hawthorn, and pears. Since the Shanhai Five Routes infiltrated the north, "off-season fruit" from Hainan arrived continuously via refrigerated ships cooled with ice blocks.

When this truly off-season fruit debuted in the capital, the wealthy households went wild with enthusiasm. Even a bunch of grapes or a banana at one tael, a pineapple or watermelon at three or four taels—each shipment sold out instantly.

Pleasure houses were money pits—naturally not afraid of expense. The fruit served was genuine "Qiongzhou fresh fruit"—as for who controlled Qiongzhou nowadays, no one asked.

Large milky glass plates held emerald and crimson watermelon slices, golden pineapple slices, and plump purple-black grapes. After long hours in heated rooms, everyone's mouths watered at the sight. The Leng Ningyun matter could wait—first, moisten their parched throats.

"This Qiongzhou fruit is truly refreshing," Qiao Wannian praised. "It's warm there year-round with no winter, so they can grow watermelons and grapes. But why are they all so succulent, the flesh so fine, the juice so abundant, so sweet on the tongue... no watermelon anywhere compares..."

17th-century watermelons were already widely cultivated, but their flesh texture and sweetness fell far short of specially bred varieties from the old timeline.

"And you can't find seeds in this watermelon—amazing, amazing!" Manager Lu laughed, spitting out a few white watermelon seeds. "The watermelon is fully ripe, but the seeds are still immature! How was this grown?"

"That's why they say the Short-Hairs... have ingenious crafts that steal heaven and earth's work!" Qiao Wannian sighed. "What a pity."

"Pity what? Are you hoping the Short-Hairs will fight for the court?"

"If we'd handled things properly back then..."

Manager Cao immediately cut him off: "No discussing state affairs!"

Qiao Wannian quickly said, "Yes, yes, won't discuss!" He turned to chat with Leng Ningyun instead. "Manager Leng, you must have been terrified by this ordeal! Fortunately, you escaped safely—congratulations indeed."

"Yes," Leng Ningyun smiled. "Thanks to the escort masters' efforts. Otherwise, I'd have been picked clean, bones and all!"

"Those bandits are truly despicable. Who knows their background—daring to be so brazen right at the Emperor's feet!"

Qiao Wannian's words were just courtesy, but Manager Shen's face clearly showed discomfort.

"Indeed! The authorities surely won't tolerate such madmen. I believe they'll be caught and brought to justice soon!"

"Yes, they had too much audacity!"

"Without executing a good batch, they won't know their place!"

...

The managers added their agreement. Whatever their feelings about Leng Ningyun, as "property owners," they felt kinship regarding kidnapping—there but for fortune go we.

Manager Shen's expression grew even worse. Though he tried to hide it, Manager Cao, that thousand-year fox, saw through him instantly. He secretly cursed Manager Shen as dishonorable.

Though none present were innocent souls, colluding with bandits was something Manager Cao strongly disapproved of. He'd vaguely heard rumors that Manager Shen was "unclean" in this affair. Today, seeing his expression, he was certain Manager Shen was involved.

Breaking vows to eat meat was one thing. But failing to get meat while getting yourself stinking—Manager Shen felt contempt.

After these pleasantries, Manager Cao felt it was time to get to business. After all, Delong was still a "member unit." As chairman, he should show some concern.

"Manager Leng, having escaped this disaster—is Delong reopening tomorrow..."

"Tomorrow we'll open for business as usual." Leng Ningyun said without hesitation. "This time, because of my troubles, the shop was sealed for many days, suffering heavy losses. If we don't reopen, I'll probably have to pack up."

"Heh, Manager Leng jokes." Manager Cao smiled and continued. "Opening for business—are you fully prepared?"

"No one's ever fully prepared in business..." Leng Ningyun deliberately sighed. "Honestly, our funds are tight."

Everyone was stunned. They'd expected him to boast about how flush he was, maybe even play an "empty city stratagem" to bluff. They hadn't expected him to so openly admit his funds were tight.

"Oh? I hear outside opinions of Delong aren't good." Manager Shen deliberately brought up.

"Yes, I've heard too. Many major depositors are planning to withdraw and redeem the moment Delong opens. There might be a run then. And if your funds are tight, should you fail to pay out, there'll be trouble that's hard to resolve."

Though this was about running on him, both spoke truth, not slander. Everyone's eyes in the hall fell on Leng Ningyun's face.

"Having suffered outside for many days and then been sealed by authorities, there's naturally concern out there. But fortunately, with the banking guild's support, I'm sure to turn danger into fortune and weather this storm."

Everyone was stunned again: What approach was this?

Seeing their bewildered faces, Leng Ningyun continued slowly. "If Delong is run into the ground, I'll certainly lose face. But the banking guild won't look too good either."

"How strange. If your shop fails, what's it got to do with us?" Manager Qin sneered.

"All fifteen of us in the banking trade, all under the Emperor's feet—all for one, one for all. Why distinguish between yours and mine?" Leng Ningyun smiled unconcerned. "Speaking of which, I came early today precisely about this matter."

Manager Shen was about to speak, but Manager Cao cut him off and said pleasantly: "Whatever Manager Leng needs, please say. Whatever the guild can help with, we'll certainly make the effort."

"Manager Cao is too kind!" Leng Ningyun said. "As the guild knows, Delong's funds are tight. Once we open, we may struggle to manage. I'd like to ask for guild assistance—perhaps a little short-term lending."

Dead silence filled the hall. No one expected Leng Ningyun to open by asking to borrow money!

True, short-term lending among money trade peers was commonplace. There were same-day clearings and loans lasting a year or eighteen months. Naturally, they'd had such dealings with Delong.

But with Delong's current situation—not just precarious but relations with the major peers, if not hostile, certainly not "harmonious."

Not kicking them when they were down was already respecting some "past sentiment." Expecting to borrow funds to weather a run was pure fantasy.

Sure enough, Manager Cao immediately looked troubled. "This... I'm afraid there's... difficulty..."

"Oh? What difficulty?" Leng Ningyun said. "As I understand, at year's beginning all houses have loose funds. Lending one or two ten thousand each shouldn't be a problem. Cash or notes—either is fine."

His attitude was quite aggressive—nothing like the modest gentleman and scholar of before. Manager Shen was secretly alarmed. Seeing Manager Cao hemming and hawing, he couldn't help jumping in: "Whether our funds are loose or tight is none of your business!"

But Leng Ningyun completely ignored him. He simply said: "This lending won't be empty words. I'll pay interest at double the highest previous daily lending rate, counted by the day. Delong will issue notes to everyone. In just seven or eight days, Delong will redeem them. As for the loan itself, cash or notes from any peer will do—interest calculated the same."
