# Chapter 2705: The Capital (Part 57)

Liao Sanniang's heart darkened, and she frowned. She looked at the big man and said to Little Bazi, "Call Old Feng over. He has a cold heart; he'll surely be able to 'persuade' this brave hero."

After speaking, Liao Sanniang looked up at the road ahead. Both ends of the dirt trail were empty; under the shade of trees, the road twisted and stretched towards unknown destinations in both directions.

The convoy halted. Old Feng walked up to Liao Sanniang, took half a step forward, bowed, and waited for instructions.

Liao Sanniang glanced at the big man lying on the ground and said to Old Feng, "Sneaking around after us like this, he's definitely up to no good. Brother, question him firmly. Find out what they're plotting. We're halfway there and can't afford delays, so make it quick."

Old Feng nodded slightly. "My Lady, rest assured."

Old Feng turned and waved to two guards beside him. "Lend a hand."

The two guards came over, and the three of them scooped up the man and dragged him into the bushes by the roadside not far away.

Liao Sanniang remained expressionless, watching the three coldly. Torture was the fastest method.

Liao Sanniang raised her chin at Little Bazi. "Go invite Brothers Zhao and Liu here for a conference."

A moment later, a scream rang out from the bushes, but it was cut short halfway through, as if the mouth had been gagged.

The figures of Old Feng and the others were obscured by the shadows of the bushes; their actions couldn't be seen clearly from the outside. Only the cigarette butt dangling from Old Feng's mouth flickered in the darkness, marking their location.

Liao Sanniang didn't wait long. Old Feng's efficiency was always high and never disappointed. He walked back quickly.

Liao Sanniang glanced at him with a slight query in her eyes, wondering what method he had used.

Old Feng spat out the cigarette butt and smiled. "These filthy methods aren't worth soiling your ears with, My Lady. A man's urethra is the most tender part; threading a steel wire into it makes him forget his ancestors and parents." After speaking, Old Feng casually tossed away half a length of bloody steel wire.

Liao Sanniang frowned in disgust and asked, "Where are they from?"

Old Feng replied, "As Little Bazi said, they are a few deserters who have gathered some local ruffians and bandits from the surrounding countryside. Thirty men in total, doing this 'no-capital private trade' everywhere. We were just unlucky enough to run into them today. This man is a scout. Just now, when we stopped for water and rest at the roadside shop, he saw our deep wheel ruts and surmised the cart carried valuable goods, so he started tracking us. There were two originally; one went back and forth to report. When we passed the fork just now, the other one went back to report, leaving only this one to tail us. The scout confessed that the bandits have already set up an ambush ahead, split into two groups, front and rear. They plan to wait until we are in the middle, then charge from both ends, intending to rob us by force."

Hearing this, Liao Sanniang felt slightly reassured. Rural bandit gangs usually consisted of five to ten men. Fifty was a threshold; exceeding that number would accelerate aggregation, quickly reaching hundreds or thousands, giving them the capability to raid prefectures and counties.

Running at around thirty men meant they were in a growth phase—a small-scale roving gang that possessed a basic cadre and the conditions to grow into a "vibrant" social organization.

Liao Sanniang brushed a stray hair from her temple and asked, "How far is the ambush site?"

Old Feng said, "Just past the next intersection."

Liao Sanniang hadn't expected the enemy to be so close. She narrowed her eyes, involuntary feeling a bit tense.

Behind her, Little Bazi grumbled in frustration, "Inside the city, we met idlers trying to swindle money; outside, we meet these random bandits. Why are we so unlucky?"

Liao Sanniang snorted coldly. "It's not that we're unlucky; we've just bumped into this chaotic world. Such things are common. Being close to the capital, there are no large bandit armies here. Further away, in Shaanxi, Henan, and Sichuan, government troops run amok and local bandits riot—that is truly lawless. They slaughter villages in broad daylight, killing thousands without it being a major event. What we have to deal with from the start isn't just these few kidnappers, but this chaotic world itself. Escort bureaus are of little use in peaceful times and hard to survive in chaotic times; in the end, they are but a trivial crack in the river of history. But for just these thirty bandits to try and take us down—that is underestimating us too much."

Liao Sanniang turned her face to look at Zhao Liangjian. "Brother Zhao, what do you think?"

Zhao Liangjian was a lean, muscular man of about thirty, wearing a rolled-brim felt hat, a blue short jacket, and leggings wrapped in a blue and white fish-scale pattern.

Zhao Liangjian looked up at the sky. "It's already the hour of Wei (1-3 PM). We've traveled this far; if we turn back, we definitely won't make it before the city gates close. We'd have to stay overnight outside the city. Moreover, all the pretense of leaving the city would be wasted. Once interested parties learn our details, it will be even harder to transport silver out next time."

Liao Sanniang nodded. "Indeed. The reason these deserters recruit local bandits is to collude like wolves and jackals, using local convenience to hide their tracks—merging with civilians to enter, turning into bandits to leave, and spying on government news. If we don't pass this intersection now, coming back next time will only draw more attention and incite even more greed in the thieves' hearts."

Liao Sanniang then looked at Liu Chang and asked, "Brother Liu, what do you think?"

Liu Chang was in his twenties, with a square, broad face. He wore a *wan*-character headscarf, dark blue clothes with the hem tucked into his belt, black leather boots, and ox-hide bracers studded with copper rivets. Hearing the question, he replied in a muffled voice, "Whatever Lady Sanniang and Brother Zhao decide, I will follow."

Liao Sanniang continued, "Laden with silver, the mule cart can't move fast. In a moment, when the bandits see we aren't arriving, they'll gather and attack from the rear to sweep us up. We'd have no way to avoid them and be forced to fight, losing the initiative. It's better to strike first and break through. If we truly can't beat them, we won't linger in battle; we'll retreat temporarily and leave the silver cart to them. They have few people; this cartload of silver can't be carried away on shoulders or by hand, so it will become a burden tying their hands and feet. While they fight over the silver, we can kill our way back to maneuver. Just don't easily lose any men; death ends everything."

Zhao Liangjian nodded. "We've covered most of the journey. Once we break through this pass, it's twenty *li* to the estate. Fifteen against thirty—we can fight."

Little Bazi asked from the side, "How do the bandits dare to be so rampant, robbing in broad daylight?"

Liu Chang shook his head and interjected, "Within the jurisdictions of various prefectures and counties, boundaries are drawn. When bandit cases occur on the borders, officials push responsibility onto each other because they don't answer to one another. It's hard to assign blame, so they follow bad precedents and drift along. The government cannot control the thieves, which is why so many bandits gather and whistle together. The ones who suffer are just the common people. As for the bandits, they believe in seeking wealth through danger. They kill people like cutting grass and have hearts like iron. They are the most crazy and evil, impossible to judge by common sense. Let alone robbing a mule cart, it wouldn't be strange for them to kill officials and burn yamens. Is there anything such people wouldn't do?"

Liao Sanniang said to Old Feng, "Go question that man in detail again. Check if his statements match up. The most important thing is that the numbers must be correct."

Not long after, Old Feng returned and reported that there were no errors.

Liao Sanniang looked at everyone. "The thieves are ambushing from front and rear. One group of eighteen or nineteen is blocking the road ahead; another group of ten is flanking from behind. We will split into two. Brother Zhao and Brother Liu, escort the cart and proceed as if nothing is wrong. When you reach the ambush site, Brother Zhao, stop and call out the 'dart code.' The thieves won't understand the black slang, so just shout in plain language. If the thieves come out, Brother Zhao and Brother Liu will rely on the cart, leading the fellows to form a formation and fight them. If they don't come out, hold your ground. Little Bazi and I will circle from the side and attack the smaller group from behind—playing the oriole behind the mantis. As long as we break one route, the other group won't be able to stay hidden and will panic and retreat. At that point, you strike from the side. Once the thieves retreat, do not pursue; instead, hurry on your way."

Zhao and Liu were stunned. Zhao Liangjian said, "You two are going to fight ten men?"

Liao Sanniang lifted the hem of her clothes and patted the short gun at her waist. "I have a repeater gun. Its sound and light steal souls; under its thunder and fire, I don't fear the thieves won't lose their nerve."

Zhao Liangjian and Liu Chang wanted to say more, but Liao Sanniang waved her hand. "No need to discuss; it's settled. The woods are deep and dense; too many people would be hard to deploy and become a burden. Two people are enough."

Seeing Liao Sanniang so confident and knowing her great skill, Zhao and Liu ceased arguing and nodded, going back to prepare.

Liao Sanniang called Old Feng over, took another revolver from the bundle on her horse, and shoved it into Old Feng's hand. "Brother Feng, among those transferred from Guangzhou, only you have trained with short guns. Take this gun and hold the line."

Old Feng worriedly said, "Lady Sanniang, it's dangerous over there. You should take them all."

Liao Sanniang glanced at Zhao and Liu, forced the short gun into Old Feng's hand, and said, "Only when my own people are close and you, Brother, hold the line, can I be at ease."

Old Feng looked at Liao Sanniang for a moment, nodded silently without declining, and whispered, "Lady, set your heart at rest."

Liao Sanniang whispered instructions: "When the fighting starts, if we are winning, don't use the gun. Open fire only if we are losing."

Old Feng grunted assent, tucked the short gun under his clothes, and returned to sit on the mule cart.

Old Feng touched the short gun in his bosom, pulled out a rolling paper, carefully sprinkled tobacco on it, rolled a cigarette, and lit it. He blew a smoke ring; the hand holding the cigarette was steady, without a single tremor.

Having finished the arrangements, Liao Sanniang said no more. She took off her wide outer cloak, revealing the dark blue tight-fitting combat suit underneath. On her feet were a pair of wedge-heeled soft combat boots—special issue from the Special Reconnaissance Team, possessing them was a privilege.

Liao Sanniang adjusted her gear. A belt was tied horizontally across her abdomen; a leather strap hung diagonally from her left shoulder, holding seven steel darts; and the revolver was tucked at her right waist.

She stood on tiptoes, bounced twice in place, and did a few stretching and twisting motions. Feeling ready and unencumbered, she walked to her horse, unhooked the double sabers, and hung them at her waist.

Liao Sanniang licked her lips. Her face was covered in frost, her voice cold enough to penetrate bone as she said coolly, "Bazi, we're going to kill people. Are you scared?"

Little Bazi untied the mud pellets and threw them aside. He took a pouch of iron pellets from the donkey's back, took one out, nested it in the slingshot's leather pocket, and stretched it twice. Then he drew the elbow-length steel knife from his waist, wiped it on his clothes, bared his teeth, and said, "On the Jianghu road, fearing death doesn't make a hero. Just go forward and kill those mother-fucking thieves."
