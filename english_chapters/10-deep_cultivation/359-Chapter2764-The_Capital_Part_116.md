# Chapter 2764: The Capital (Part 116)

Yang Tianliang came out of Yang Gonggong's residence, feeling his legs weak but also relieved of a heavy burden. Touching the envelope in his bosom, he realized he wasn't dreaming.

Unexpectedly, his adoptive father not only didn't detect his conspiracy but was also so generous. That's right, presumably this old thing also knew his days were numbered and had to rely on him, the adopted son.

Should have been like this earlier! Yang Tianliang thought, why make me toss about like this!

However, giving twenty thousand silver at once, the old thing was really generous. Never mind, wait until he gets to the Directorate of Imperial Horses, then curry favor well with Wang Zhixin. Afterwards, if this old thing breathes his last smoothly, let it be; if he refuses to breathe his last, sending him to the Western Heaven then won't be too late.

Before that, might as well perfunctory this old fellow again.

He indeed had a few bottles of "Nanyang Aphrodisiac Wine" in his hands, all obtained from Liu Sha, said to be very effective. He tried one, and it was indeed very effective. Presenting it to Yang Gonggong just like this, he was somewhat unwilling.

However, him wanting the medicinal wine was a good opportunity. Use the medicinal wine to finish him off in the future. Anyway, this medicinal wine is just a bottle; what's inside is up to him to decide.

Thinking of medicinal wine reminded him of Liu Sha. This person's whereabouts being unknown was always a hidden danger. Yang Tianliang felt vaguely uneasy in his heart, but thinking again that very few people knew about his relationship with Liu Sha, as long as he didn't fall into Australian hands, it wouldn't matter.

Pondering in the sedan chair, suddenly the sedan chair paused and stopped. Yang Tianliang was stunned, lifted the curtain and asked: "What happened?"

But no one answered. The little eunuch who came out with him was not by the sedan chair.

Looking carefully, outside was not a street, but some unknown "factory" (*chang*). There were many kinds of "factories" inside and outside the Capital City, all places where various yamen piled materials. Such as Red Silk Factory, War Chariot Factory, Wood Factory, Manure Factory, etc. These "factories" occupied a large area. Apart from a few guards, very few people came on weekdays. They were very desolate places in the city.

Yang Tianliang had been in the Capital since childhood and served in the palace. He had been to many such places. But this place was very strange.

He was greatly shocked, immediately realizing he had been tricked! Just as he was about to run wildly, his body was held firmly. Two "sedan bearers" twisted his left and right arms, causing pain to the bone. Unconsciously, he screamed miserably, unable to move his whole body.

Someone kicked him hard in the crook of his knee. Yang Tianliang involuntarily plopped down, kneeling in the muddy snow. He was extremely terrified and said: "Good fellows, good fellows, don't use force..."

The four "sedan bearers" ignored him, only searching him silently from head to toe. Seeing the envelope on his chest being searched away, Yang Tianliang secretly felt heartache, but also felt relieved. It seemed the other party came for wealth, so his small life was safe.

At this time, the leader asked: "Are you the Manager of the Sutra Factory, Yang Tianliang?"

"Yes, yes, it is precisely ourself (*zanjia*)." The other party came prepared, so naturally, he couldn't deny it. Yang Tianliang remembered Liu Sha taught him that when encountering such things, one must absolutely not look up at people's faces, only lower the head and beg, "Silver, you have already taken. Beg good fellows to raise your hands high..."

"Silver, keep it for yourself; it's useful on the road." The leader said slowly, "Bright people don't speak dark words. Brothers have no grievance or enmity with you. Sending you on the road today is entrusted by someone. When you arrive at the Yin Cao Di Fu (Underworld), don't hold a grudge against brothers."

Only then did Yang Tianliang know that the comers were not highwaymen but came to take his life. He instantly went limp on the ground and wailed: "Don't do it! Don't do it! I have silver! Silver! However much they give, I give double, add another ten thousand taels. No, twenty thousand, is twenty thousand enough? Even more I can scrape together... Raise hands high, raise hands high... Spare life..."

While begging for mercy, his body shook like a sieve. He had the heart to resist but was twisted by key joints and couldn't move.

The four ignored him completely, dragging and pulling him into an empty room. A rope had already been hung on the beam, with a long bench placed underneath. There was also a clay fire basin beside it.

The leader lengthened his tone and shouted: "Come! Serve Eunuch Yang on the road! Ascend to Ultimate Bliss early."

The remaining three responded in unison: "Yes!" They clumsily sent Yang Tianliang onto the long bench and put him into the noose. Yang Tianliang's face was ashen, struggling desperately, but still couldn't escape. His neck was forcefully noosed, and instantly the long bench was kicked to the ground. Only Yang Tianliang's body was left struggling and twitching in mid-air.

The four watched silently by the side until the body in mid-air had no more movement. Someone checked the pulse and announced loudly: "Eunuch Yang has become an immortal!"

The people aside immediately lit a fire in the fire basin, melting a set of paper figures, sedan chair, and horses in it, and added a string of tin ingots.

The leader tore open the envelope containing the bank note and took out the note inside. Where was this any Delong bank note? It was a netherworld bill printed with "Fengdu Currency" and "Treasure Note Twenty Thousand Ingots"!

He threw the envelope and netherworld bill into the fire together. The dancing flames gradually swallowed the paper.

The news of Yang Tianliang "hanging himself" did not cause much concern in the palace. There were tens of thousands of eunuchs serving in this palace. Many people died every year, and suicides were not few. The death of a person made less of a splash than the death of a cat or dog of a master in the palace.

However, Yang Tianliang was, after all, the Manager of the Sutra Factory and the adopted son of the Seal-holding Eunuch of the Bell and Drum Division. Therefore, the funeral was held quite grandly. The eunuchs of the Bell and Drum Division from top to bottom inevitably had to give funeral gifts. For those intending to drill, it was an even better opportunity. As for other big eunuchs, looking at Yang Gonggong's face, they more or less had to give some. After a funeral, deducting expenses, about a thousand taels could be netted.

While handling the funeral, Yang Gonggong called over a personal eunuch to look after the aftermath matters.

"...Go and take over the lodgings in the palace and outside with people. Don't rush to flip through the things inside. Seal them all up for inspection later."

"Yes, Old Ancestor."

"Reward the maid paired with him fifty taels of silver. If she is willing to go home, report a sudden death for her and let her leave the palace. If not willing, stay in the palace to continue serving." Yang Gonggong lay face up on a "Nanyang Rattan Couch," saying slowly, "If you like the few women in his mansion, keep them all."

"Old Ancestor is joking; how can this slave afford to feed..." The eunuch was apprehensive and fearful.

"What, dislike the monthly money for being little?"

"Dare not, dare not," the eunuch said hurriedly.

"I say you can afford it, you can afford it," Yang Gonggong sneered. "What do you worry about?"

"Yes, yes, fully rely on Old Ancestor's cultivation!"

"How many years have you followed me?"

"Tianqi Year Five. Not long after this small one entered the palace, I was assigned to Old Ancestor's name."

"So, it has been quite a few years." Yang Gonggong nodded and looked carefully at the kneeling person, laughing, "A monkey cub! How old?"

"Slave is twenty-eight years old."

"Really young." Yang Gonggong let out a sound like a sigh, "You followed me these years. Although the things done were not big, they were all very proper."

"Thank Old Ancestor for the praise! All are what slave should do."

"Hehe, ourself doesn't praise people for no reason." Yang Gonggong laughed, "Like this, I promote you now."

"Thank Old Ancestor! Thank Old Ancestor!" The eunuch kowtowed repeatedly.

"Don't rush!" Yang Gonggong waved his hand, "Your Big Brother Yang is gone. Ourself and Eunuch Cao of the Directorate of Ceremonial have agreed on his position. I give you ten days. Go to the Sutra Factory and fetch a copy of the *Little Infinite Life Sutra* for me. After success, go and take this errand."

"Yes, thank Old Ancestor. Slave will definitely not fail Old Ancestor's grace!" The eunuch was overjoyed and kowtowed several more times.

Going to the Sutra Factory to fetch scriptures seemed like a running errand, but in reality, it was a test for eunuchs who wanted to be promoted. If they could successfully obtain the scripture, it meant their skills and interpersonal relationships were sufficient to cope with higher job assignments.

Of course, this opportunity was not given casually. Yang Gonggong had observed the personal eunuch in front of him for a long time, basically considering him extremely secure.

"From today on, you change your name to Yang Tianbian."

"Yes, thank Old Ancestor for bestowing the name!"

Although the name was changed, Yang Gonggong was not anxious to accept him as an adopted son. First, Yang Tianliang's "bones were not cold yet"; second, he was also afraid, fearing raising another "white-eyed wolf." Yang Tianliang had "shared tribulations" and was still unreliable, let alone a newcomer who had been with him for only just over ten years?

He had secretly observed this spare tire Yang Tianbian for many years, believing he could do things and counted as loyal. But usually, he never showed favor to this person. First, if the adopted son found out, he might find an opportunity to lay a poisonous hand; second, to see his temperament.

Now it seemed this person could endure loneliness. He did many things and didn't get many benefits, yet never complained about the Yang Gonggong father and son. He was a very cautious person.

Now, Yang Tianliang was dead. Someone had to continue doing those important errands for him. Although the years were a bit short, there was not much room for choice now.

He was a person over sixty, and his time serving in the palace was not much. Muddling along for a few more years, inevitably he would have to "retire." Yang Tianliang's death was a great loss to him, but he really couldn't imagine what this harbored malicious adopted son would do.

Now that he committed suicide, it counted as unloading a troublesome matter from his heart.

Seeing Yang Tianbian still kneeling in front of him, he suddenly remembered a matter and said: "You go to Deong Bank tomorrow and meet Shopkeeper Leng."

Yang Tianbian was overjoyed. This was the second great news today. He knew this Shopkeeper Leng of Delong was one of Yang Gonggong's money bags. The interaction between the two sides was extremely close. Before Yang Tianliang died, except for the recent half-year or so, he was always responsible for docking and passing messages.

Calling him to meet now, didn't it mean that this errand also fell into his hands!

"Yes," Yang Tianbian asked: "Slave goes over, do I need to pass any message to him?"

"Just say, the past things are all past. Ask Shopkeeper Leng not to be too haggling. What he helped ourself with, ourself naturally remembers."
