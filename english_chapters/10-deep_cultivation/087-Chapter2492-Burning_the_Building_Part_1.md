# Chapter 2492: Burning the Building (Part 1)

Outside the east gate of the Liang residence, more than ten sturdy mule carts fully loaded with grain, rice, and miscellaneous goods were parked in a disorderly manner, with shafts and sides adjacent to each other, crowded together and unable to move. With hands on his hips, Liang Yuanfu stood in front of the residence gate, reprimanding the incompetent gatekeepers while gesticulating to direct several gatekeepers to clear the road. The neighing of livestock, the shouting of cart drivers, and the cursing of gatekeepers intertwined, creating a noisy chaos in front of the gate. An endless stream of male servants carried rice and grain in straw bags, fresh fish in baskets, and fruits and vegetables in large crates into the residence warehouse or moved them into the kitchen. Stewards and village heads verified the accounts handed in, and several young servants skilled in calculation checked the numbers non-stop, shouting them out from time to time. Accountants quickly wrote off the incoming and outgoing entries. Everything seemed busy and full of vitality.

An inner courtyard servant walked quickly to the gate, found Liang Yuanfu, and said: "Steward Liang, the Young Master asks. He mentioned earlier that the Uncle-in-Law said he sent someone to exchange for a Lingbi stone ornament, the appearance of which is quite extraordinary. He said it would be brought along this time. The Young Master has been concerned about it and asks if it has arrived. If it has arrived, there is no need to store it in the warehouse; just have people carry it directly to the Yiwen Pavilion. Also, call the person sent by the Uncle-in-Law to come along for a meeting."

Liang Yuanfu repeatedly said: "Arrived, arrived." He immediately turned around to arrange things. Not long after, two strong servants were seen carrying a two-foot-high Lingbi stone and its base with a large pole. Together with the servant from the Liang family's in-laws, they followed the young servant toward the inner residence.

The Liang residence was a large mansion with heavy walls and layered courtyards. At every gate passed, the young servant took out a wake-up pass for the guards to check. As heavy gates closed behind them one by one, the noise outside gradually subsided and finally disappeared completely. The quiet and deep inner courtyard seemed to cut off all disturbances from the mortal world, making one feel as if they were in two different worlds.

After walking for a long time, they passed through a moon gate with a plaque inscribed "Yiwen Pavilion" and arrived in a spacious large courtyard. The young servant led everyone to carry the Lingbi stone straight into the room, then immediately retreated. Those serving here were all middle-aged maids; not a single man was seen. Liang Cunhou had been waiting here for a long time. Seeing it, he immediately stepped forward, unable to wait to circle around it for quite a while, before smiling with uncontrollable joy: "Dragon scales layered, gullies winding, coiled chimera standing bone-like, naturally formed. This stone is a great unpolished jade, lacking much artificial affectation. It is truly a good object! Uncle has taken pains."

After speaking, he smiled at the in-law family servant and said: "Are Uncle and Aunt well?"

That servant was over thirty years old, eight *chi* tall, tall and burly. His appearance was very honest and mature. A short mustache under his jaw added a touch of majesty. Hearing Liang Cunhou's inquiry, he hurriedly stepped forward to bow and said: "The Master and Mistress are in good health. They only say they miss the Young Master. If the Young Master has leisure, please come to the residence for a short stay."

Liang Cunhou said: "We are relatives; that's easy to say. Is there a letter?"

The servant said: "There is. Young Master, please look." After speaking, he took out a letter from his chest and handed it over, continuing: "In addition, the Master and Mistress have many family matters for this slave to pass on orally to the Young Master, only fearing the matters are too trivial and the Young Master might be impatient."

Liang Cunhou smiled and said: "No hurry. I have nothing to do today; you can tell me slowly." Then he waved his hand to the corridor and said: "I don't need service here. You all withdraw from the courtyard. I will chat with him for a moment." The maids responded "Yes" and bowed to leave.

Liang Cunhou walked to the door and slowly closed the room doors with both hands. The bright morning sunlight became narrower and narrower between the two door panels, finally turning into a line left outside, only casting some dappled light and shadows through the window lattice. The room seemed to suddenly cool down. Liang Cunhou didn't look at the Lingbi stone again. He walked slowly to the table and sat down, his expression looking desolate and tired.

The servant straightened his body and walked to the corner of the room. The projected spot of light divided his body diagonally into two halves; his lower body was illuminated by sunlight, while his upper body was hidden in darkness.

Liang Cunhou asked the servant in a low voice: "Qiaoyan, have those four scribes been sent away?"

The man called Qiaoyan answered in a deep voice: "They have been sent away. Recently, the Baldies intensified their checks. Fortunately, Second Brother Yun planned early; otherwise, I'm afraid there would be trouble. Only one of them showed a lot of suspicion when Second Brother Yun tested him with words. Afterward, we searched secretly and found he had hidden a catalogue of *Tian Qing Guang Wen Lu* and half a volume of handwritten draft text. Under torture, we learned this scoundrel intended to report to the Baldies. Second Brother Yun had his whole family stabbed, scuttled the boat, and sank them all into the river. Second Brother Yun tested the other three, and there were no flaws. They have now been sent out of the Liangguang region. Young Master, rest assured; there will be no loose ends."

Liang Cunhou seemed somewhat melancholy and whispered: "Why bother? I didn't wish for this originally."

Qiaoyan said: "Those who achieve great things do not stick to trifles. The Young Master should know not to lose the big because of the small."

Liang Cunhou sighed lightly and said: "I know. It's just that others died because of me in the end. My heart is uneasy; it just adds to my sentimentality."

Liang Cunhou zoned out for a while, then suddenly asked: "Qiaoyan, are you afraid?"

Qiaoyan was silent for a moment, then said: "Five years ago, when the Baldies shelled Guangzhou city, I had business and wasn't at home. The Baldies unleashed fire meteors. That night, fire rain filled the sky, burning half the sky red. One fire meteor flew into my house. Beams, pillars, beds, cabinets, clothes, quilts, firewood, and grass all ignited. This fire couldn't be extinguished; it stuck to the body and attached to the bone. Later, I heard neighbors say that in an instant, the whole courtyard was on fire, and the whole family was burned. Only an old slave escaped. I came back and dug out my parents and wife. They were all burned into black charcoal, unrecognizable. My wife was holding two children, burned into a lump; I broke my palms but couldn't separate them, so I buried them in a heap. Since then, I haven't been afraid." Qiaoyan's voice was slow and flat, with no fluctuation in tone, as if he were recounting something completely unrelated to himself.

Pausing slightly, Qiaoyan continued: "Since becoming an adult, what I've been doing all these years is planting stolen goods, making false accusations, and killing people like cutting grass without a sound. I know doing these things shortens one's life span. I just didn't expect the retribution to fall on..." His voice stopped abruptly, with no further sound.

After a long time, Liang Cunhou sighed lightly and said: "Qiaoyan, do you think we can succeed?"

Qiaoyan seemed to think for a moment, then shook his head and said: "Although I know a little reading and writing, I am ultimately a coarse man who only knows fighting and killing. I don't know these things and can't think them through. But if there are a million people in the world resisting the Baldies, I will definitely be one of them. If there is only one person in the world resisting the Baldies, I will be that person."

Liang Cunhou smiled with a sense of loss and said: "Those who uphold justice are often dog butchers; those who break hearts are always scholars. Although you have no learning, you have a body of good character!"

A trace of cold mockery hung at the corner of his mouth as he said: "Right now, the Liang residence still looks glorious and magnificent from the outside, but in reality, there are internal troubles and external aggression. The Baldies' steps are rigorous, like a national grandmaster laying out a game of Go, linking tightly thread by thread. Now the Liang residence is being stared at closely by the Finance and Taxation Bureau. The dark door business, this large source of wealth, is about to be fed to the vicious dog of the Finance and Taxation Bureau! The Australian detectives are also staring at my place every day without fail. Just looking at the few vendors in front of the door—do they really take me for a dead man? Those who used to boast of their integrity and pride no longer come to visit. In the past, when talking about the Baldy situation in the study, every one of them would 'sacrifice their bodies for the national crisis, regarding death as going home.' But when trouble actually arrives, each one's words do not match their deeds. They fear the Baldies like tigers, terrified of being implicated. No wonder people often say, scholars rebelling won't succeed in ten years."

Qiaoyan said: "The Young Master need not feel sorry for himself. Second Brother Yun read *Tian Qing Guang Wen Lu*. He said the success or failure of conquering the Baldies in the future will depend entirely on this book. He said there is no other person in the world with such insight."

Liang Cunhou shook his head gently, smiled a bitter self-mocking smile, and said: "Just some presumptuous words, that's all. When I first learned of the Baldies, I felt their conduct was very different from our China. but I didn't think deeply about where the differences lay, only saying it was strange skills and ingenious devices. Later, the Baldies occupied Lingao, and their wolfish ambition began to appear. Until Governor Wang attacked Qiongzhou. Before raising troops, Commander He actually knew almost nothing about the Baldies. After landing in Qiongzhou, scouts and spies didn't go more than half a *li* out of the camp. The battlefield was completely screened by the Baldies. He knew nothing about the Baldies' armor, guns, cannons, battle formations, or grain and baggage. It was exactly like a blind and deaf person fighting someone with sharp ears and eyes. During the battle, the soldiers had no will to fight, advancing and retreating without measure. Only thus led to the defeat at Chengmai. Sun Tzu said: Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles. Not knowing oneself, and even less knowing the enemy—how could there be any reason not to be defeated? Later, the Baldies invaded Guangzhou Prefecture, burning, killing, looting, and acting violently and tyrannically. Their conduct became increasingly arrogant. At this point, the ambition of Cao and Mang was completely revealed. In grief and indignation, I wrote *Eleven Memorials on the Qiongzhou Defeat Strategy*, listing all the causes of defeat. Whenever I think of this, I can hardly sleep day or night, hating that I cannot take a three-foot sword into the hundred-ren city to die for the country in righteousness."

At this point, Liang Cunhou looked dejected, then continued: "I felt deeply the harm of not understanding the Baldies' situation, so I conceived the idea of compiling a collection on the Baldies, which is this *Tian Qing Guang Wen Lu*." Speaking of this, Liang Cunhou pointed to a large room outside the window and said: "That room is filled with Baldy books. Whatever is sold on the market, I buy them all. At first, I couldn't make heads or tails of them. After reading for a long time, I found some ways. For instance, this public financial report—one can get a glimpse of the Baldies' economic ways. If compared year by year, one can know the increase or decrease of the Baldies' income. Combined with military intelligence, one can slightly know how much the Baldies' military funds are. Also, the railway of this iron-wheeled vehicle—where it is built, where stations are placed, whether built, repaired, or stopped—all has profound and hidden meanings. I won't elaborate on them to you. Moreover, the Baldies have a method of unifying a hundred into one. In times of events, various ministries can immediately unify authority and responsibility, commanding like an arm using fingers, forming a combined force. Thousands of threads and loose ends are all coordinated. One hundred can defeat a thousand; a thousand can defeat ten thousand. The Baldies call it a 'system'."

Pausing for a moment, Liang Cunhou said again: "Also this 'Investigation of Things' (Gewu). The Baldies' learning of the Investigation of Things is different from Mr. Yangming's 'Wang School' of Investigation of Things. The Baldies pursue even the most trivial learning to the end. Each person only chooses one path to learn, called a 'major' or 'profession.' Therefore, the Baldies have many specialists. The words of the sages encompass broadly and can discuss world affairs, so we have many generalists. But generalists are hard to be precise, so the Baldy artisans are far superior to ours. What is more worrying is not that we are unwilling to learn, but that we cannot learn and don't know how to learn. Books on chemistry, physics, mathematics, etc., are placed on the desk. Every character is recognizable, but the text is incomprehensible. Even studying until hair turns white, one can only learn without understanding. The secret of the Baldies' rich country and strong army lies entirely in this. One can only sigh in vain."

Liang Cunhou said again: "I collected all these miscellaneous studies in this book and added detailed annotations, just to present it to the Holy Son of Heaven one day. When the Heavenly Army suppresses the rebels, having preparation beforehand will allow seizing opportunities as events occur. Resolute decision-making in moving troops and handling affairs will allow having a well-thought-out plan, ensuring everything goes smoothly."
