# Chapter 2720: The Capital (Part 72)

After arriving in the capital, Little Qian spent some money and quickly found out everything about Liu Xiaobian.

Liu Xiaobian's duty at Nanyuan was once every five days—he would stay in the garden for five days, then repeat the cycle. The day his body was discovered wasn't one of his duty days. He was a bachelor with no relatives besides his sister and brother-in-law to look after him. He was often away from home for ten days at a time, so the neighbors thought nothing of it.

Relying on his brother-in-law's influence, Liu Xiaobian had an easy time in the outer city. People from all walks of life had to give him face. Thus, his behavior was wild and reckless, and both ordinary citizens and *Jianghu* people had a very poor opinion of him. Naturally, he didn't have any real friends—just a few fair-weather drinking buddies who hung around him when he had money and scattered when he didn't.

If he had any family aside from his sister and brother-in-law, it was only a half-door prostitute by the riverside in the outer city, with the stage name "Jiulixiang" (Nine Miles of Fragrance), his old sweetheart. Little Qian posed as a pleasure-seeker and found Jiulixiang. He claimed to be a friend of Liu Xiaobian, sent by him before his death to deliver two taels of silver to his sweetheart.

Jiulixiang was skeptical because Liu Xiaobian had practically no friends, and had plenty of debts outside. How could such a loyal friend suddenly appear? But since there was silver to be had, she wasn't about to quibble. Little Qian ordered wine and food, and they chatted over drinks. After a few cups of wine, Jiulixiang told him everything about Liu Xiaobian.

Most of it was meaningless. But from her, Little Qian learned several important things.

First, Liu Xiaobian had been working at Nanyuan for half a year. During the first two months, he often expressed a desire to quit and would frequently sneak out. Jiulixiang had advised him several times. But starting in September, he suddenly became very enthusiastic. Not only did he show up on time for every shift, he never slacked off again.

Such enthusiasm was, of course, because "money moves mountains." Jiulixiang said Liu Xiaobian's job wasn't an official government position, just a hanger-on role with no salary to speak of. As for the monthly embezzled money and rice and "tribute," it didn't amount to much. Plus, the castrated men housed in Nanyuan formed cliques and gangs and weren't easy to deal with. For someone like Liu Xiaobian, who was used to idling and gambling, this obviously held little appeal.

But starting in September, he suddenly became flush with money. Not only did he pay off his debts everywhere, he gave Jiulixiang a ring and earrings. Every month, he gave her one tael of silver for food and drink.

"One tael a month as pocket money—that's what a senior clerk at a big shop in the inner city would get. I also thought it was strange, where he got all that money. I asked him, but he just said he'd met a benefactor who was helping him, and his job was now very lucrative."

"Oh, what benefactor? Who would help him like that? Nanyuan is a backwater."

"Exactly. Several managing eunuchs from Nanyuan also come to our place. They're eunuchs, but they still put on airs—claiming they wear the imperially bestowed 'Flying Fish' robes. I don't care if it's flying fish or salted fish; when it comes to money, they're stingy as can be," Jiulixiang complained. "So I said I didn't believe it. That dead ghost said it wasn't the managing eunuchs of Nanyuan. When I pressed him, he wouldn't say more, only that it was some eunuch."

This was a crucial lead. If the benefactor helping Liu Xiaobian was a eunuch, he must be connected to the Leng Ningyun kidnapping case. The one who directed Liu Xiaobian to lead people to rob with Martial Yama was most likely him.

"The eunuchs working at Nanyuan are all 'black' eunuchs from the palace—those who fell out of favor and were banished to this desolate garden. How could they be called benefactors?"

"Whether he's in favor or not, he didn't say, and I don't know. But having money is real. Ever since he met this 'benefactor,' he always had several taels of silver on him, eating, drinking, and carousing everywhere—who knows which dog hole he crawled into!"

Jiulixiang's words carried resentment, implying that Liu Xiaobian probably had other women on the side.

That wasn't Little Qian's concern. What he cared about most was who Liu Xiaobian's benefactor was. He remembered that Third Master Qin had arranged the Nanyuan job for Liu Xiaobian through a palace eunuch, so he asked who that person was—had Liu Xiaobian ever mentioned him?

Jiulixiang said she hadn't heard him mention it, only knew it was a powerful eunuch in the palace.

"What's his surname?"

"I never heard him say. But Third Master Qin is close to a eunuch surnamed Cao. They often interact. It was probably through his connections."

By this point, Jiulixiang was tipsy to the point of collapsing. Her bleary eyes seemed to drip water as she cooed, "With such a lovely evening, why talk about such boring things? Come..."

Little Qian spent the night at Jiulixiang's. The next day, he quietly left a tael of silver and slipped away. He met up with Min Zhanlian and reported the intelligence he had gathered.

"...I think we should make Nanyuan our priority target for investigation. This garden is very large but has few people. It's entirely possible to hide someone there."

Though Nanyuan was outside the city, it was right next to the capital. As a royal garden, its status was exalted, and ordinary people weren't allowed inside. Yet it had been neglected for so long that management was lax. With a guide familiar with the place, one could come and go freely. Even without a guide, there were many places where the walls had collapsed. Inside, the grounds were vast, dotted with lakes and marshes, with lush vegetation, remaining in a primitive state.

Both Min Zhanlian and Heliansheng knew this was a good place to hide a hostage. But the problem was also its size. The altars, temples, and gardens in the capital all covered large areas, and Nanyuan's area was second to none—its perimeter wall was 120 *li*, many times larger than the capital itself. Without a clear lead, searching for someone inside would be like looking for a needle in the sea.

"You know as well as I do that Nanyuan is boundless. We have so few people. Even adding Heliansheng's people, it would take at least a month to sweep through Nanyuan." Min Zhanlian frowned. "Nanyuan is one thread. Go investigate it. Also see what else you can squeeze out of Third Master Qin—especially that Eunuch Cao who got Liu Xiaobian the job. Best if you can dig into his background."

Little Five arrived in Tongzhou and began investigating Liu Sha's background. But this man's origins were quite mysterious. Although he traveled frequently between the capital, Tongzhou, and Tianjin, no one knew whose master he actually served. His lips were extremely tight; he never mentioned a word about his employer. He spent money generously, acted decisively, and maintained good relationships with both officialdom and the *Jianghu*. Though he had no "territory" and did no "business," he was a "big shot" on the scene. Little Five and his two subordinates worked for two or three days but came up with nothing.

Seeing the situation was difficult, Little Five feared that continuing to inquire would alert Liu Sha. He had his subordinates stop making inquiries and just keep watch on Liu Sha's woman's residence, monitoring his movements at all times.

After two or three days, Little Five noticed something unusual. Liu Sha's activities in Tongzhou weren't actually mysterious. Every day, he went to four or five teahouses to meet and chat with different people. Though he couldn't hear exactly what they were saying, the people he met were mostly local ruffians of Tongzhou; sometimes there were also people from Tianjin.

This frequent meeting with people to some extent confirmed Min Zhanlian's guess.

If so, Manager Leng might not even be in the capital—perhaps hidden in Tongzhou, Tianjin, or even Zhangjiawan, for all they knew. Little Five thought. After all, misdirection was nothing new to these people. This would explain why Heliansheng had spent so much manpower and resources in the capital but came up with nothing.

But this alone wasn't enough to confirm that Liu Sha was a member of the kidnapping gang, because other illicit trades had similar needs.

If this were an ordinary person, with his flying-thief skills, he could infiltrate the mistress's house and investigate. This residence was Liu Sha's base of operations in the Tongzhou area; there must be something important stored there. But this man was from the Imperial Guard background and had been in the *Jianghu* for years. Infiltrating would surely leave traces and arouse suspicion. Besides, this wasn't about stealing gold, silver, or a specific item; searching for clues in the dark of night was inconvenient.

Just as the investigation in Tongzhou reached an impasse, a rather sudden piece of news came from the outer city: Second Master Qin was dead.

This Second Master Qin was the clan brother of Third Master Qin, the sitting tiger of the outer city. Unlike his younger brother, this elder brother ran a legitimate business, traveling between Zhangjiakou and Tongzhou each year, trading frontier goods. Not a great merchant, but a prosperous household.

Doing business beyond the frontier required dealing with Mongols, local officials, and garrison soldiers. Since the court had gone to war with the Eastern Barbarians, frontier trade was effectively "illegal." Long-distance trading carried great risks on the road. So Second Master Qin was no ordinary merchant—he not only kept a group of fighters but also had martial skills himself. He was quite a figure in the area north of the capital.

Such a prominent man had inexplicably died in the moat north of the capital. When he was fished out, they found he had been strangled. Most horrifying of all, his tongue had been cut out while he was still alive.

Such treatment was a very clear warning. The news immediately caught Li Rufeng's attention. The killer of Second Master Qin was certainly a member of the kidnapper gang. The reason was obvious: he had specifically come to report that he had encountered Leng Ningyun on the road to Haidian on the outskirts of the capital. The kidnappers were probably using this to intimidate all relevant witnesses.

But Second Master Qin's report had been nearly ten days ago. If the kidnappers wanted to kill to warn, why wait until now? Li Rufeng was quite puzzled. Second Master Qin's report on Manager Leng's whereabouts wasn't secret. Second Master Qin himself had no intention of hiding it.

Could it be that Second Master Qin had discovered some other secret, and that's what brought about his death?

Most strange of all was Third Master Qin. This sitting tiger of the outer city wept bitterly at the memorial hall, swearing to catch the killer and avenge his brother. But after returning home, he did nothing at all. He didn't even go to the teahouse anymore, staying at home every day, claiming he was "too grief-stricken and had fallen ill."

"Little Qian, now you need to focus more on Third Master Qin," Min Zhanlian said. "He's definitely hiding something!"
