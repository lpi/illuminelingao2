# Chapter 2573 - Heated Debate (Part 1)

Zhao Xunru sighed and said: "Mengliang, since your clan has received Ming stipends for generations and enjoyed imperial favor, why have you degraded yourself to serve the bandits?"

This was quite an impolite remark. Those present didn't take offense, however—after all, Liu Dalin had already stated his position, so their side needn't hide behind pretenses either.

Liu Dalin's expression didn't change. He said: "Since the First Emperor unified the realm, the Western Han enjoyed the state for 210 years, the Eastern Han 196 years, the two Jin merely 156 years, the great Tang only 290 years, and the Southern and Northern Song combined 320 years. From the founding by our Taizu to now, the Great Ming has lasted exactly 270 years. The burdens have accumulated past the point of return, the dynasty totters in wind and rain. Within, peasant uprisings spring up everywhere; without, the Tartars pound at the passes. Troops are added daily yet cannot repel the enemy; taxes increase monthly yet cannot meet national needs. These are the signs of a dynasty's end. In this chaotic age, the Senate rules Qiong and Yue with ambitions for all under heaven, seeking to rescue the people from fire and flood, spreading grace to the four directions. Though I was a Ming minister, I was not minister to one family alone, but minister to all under heaven. I am willing to speak for the common people—though I sink to hell, I shall have no regrets!"

Yao Dian stroked his white goatee and said in a slightly hoarse voice: "Even if you, Mengliang, are full of learning, the Australians only gave you the title of Chief Consultative Councillor. Your orders never leave the Consultative Bureau—you're not even equal to a fake-Kun yellow-haired child. How can you do great deeds to save the common people? Truly casting pearls before swine."

"Ha ha ha..." Hearing Yao Dian's words, Liu Dalin laughed helplessly. "What do you mean, 'full of learning'? That's just us bragging about ourselves. Who knows there's always a sky beyond the sky, people beyond people? When the Senate first arrived, I too saw them as giant pirates from overseas, using profit to entice ruffians, imitating the Portuguese occupation of Macau. Qiongya is at the ends of the earth, the furthest reaches of our realm—culture not flourishing, products not abundant, bandits rampant. The county school's few mu of thin farmland couldn't even support a handful of students. Successive county magistrates, though aspiring to improve, were trapped and helpless, ultimately accomplishing nothing. After the Holy Ship descended, in just a few years, the bandits of Qiongzhou were swept away completely. The people prospered and taxes were sufficient. Moliaxuan rang with reading voices, and the remote backwater of Lingao became an earthly paradise. Such achievements of overturning heaven and earth—what virtue or ability do I have to claim even an inch of credit? It was all accomplished by the Chiefs leading a group of young people."

As he spoke, Liu Dalin unconsciously pulled a round metal object from his robe. He had developed the habit of checking the time while in Lingao. With a press of a button, the glass-inlaid metal lid flipped open to reveal moving hands—a mechanical self-winding pocket watch, only half a palm in size. Everyone was familiar with Western clocks and Australian clocks, but what they usually saw were enormous standing clocks. To compress a standing clock into such a tiny case—what divine craftsmanship! This item must certainly have been a gift from the true Australians. The Australians' treatment of Liu Dalin was generous indeed.

Though they had all heard through various channels of the Australians' miracles in Lingao, hearing it from the mouth of a classmate friend who had served the Baldies for many years had a completely different impact on these old fellows in their fifties and sixties.

Chen Zilü said: "It seems Mengliang intends to be a lobbyist for the Australians."

Liu Dalin tucked the pocket watch back into his robe and said: "The word 'lobbyist' doesn't quite apply. It's just that the people under heaven are suffering, and someone can do good things for them, so I too wish to contribute a small effort. The people's peace and contentment is the great way of governance."

Zhao Xunru sighed in admiration: "Mengliang's heart is truly magnanimous—willing to serve as a supporting role for the people's welfare."

"What can these sick old bones of mine accomplish? This world belongs to the young." Liu Dalin waved his hand. "An Australian sage once said: 'The world is yours, and also ours, but in the final analysis, it is yours. You young people are full of vigor and vitality, like the sun at eight or nine in the morning. Hope is placed on you.'"

He Wuzhou said: "Rough words but true reason. When Ouyang Xiu met Su Dongpo, he also said: 'Reading Su Shi's works, I can't help but sweat with excitement. How exhilarating! This old man should step aside and let him lead the way.'"

Yao Dian said: "I've heard that Australian schools don't teach poetry and classics. They prioritize literacy alone—merely elementary education. How can they accomplish what we scholars cannot?"

Before Liu Dalin could speak, Chen Zizhuang spoke up: "Brother Shengjin has truly been away from worldly affairs for too long. The Australians came from Australia, calling themselves descendants of the Song who preceded us. Though in remote wilds, they haven't forgotten their roots and also have poetry, classics, and histories. Their learning is: literacy first, then arithmetic—this is the foundation of Australian secret arts. When students are older, they're taught various specialized studies called 'physics,' 'chemistry,' 'engineering,' 'agricultural technology.' The classics of masters and histories become separate subjects, only briefly surveyed. After graduation, students become farmers, workers, or soldiers, each placed accordingly. Before being employed as cadres, they must be taught by true Australians—this is called 'training.' Only then, with orderly systems and strict regulations, can they be directed as easily as one's own arm."

Liu Dalin was somewhat surprised. He hadn't expected Chen Zizhuang's understanding of the Senate to be so deep. He said: "Jisheng's words are quite accurate. The difference between our dynasty's official system and Ming's is that officials and clerks are unified. As the saying goes, 'fierce generals emerge from the ranks, high ministers rise from the counties.' All officials start as junior clerks. Since ancient times, imperial power hasn't extended below the county level. Floating officials govern a region for only a few years, while grassroots affairs are all controlled by local clerks. With no hope of advancement and no imperial salary, clerks exploit their positions for private gain, becoming local tyrants and bringing disaster to their districts. The Ming chaos has the clerks' contribution as well. Once officials and clerks are unified and clerks can become officials, those with future prospects will naturally restrain themselves."

Chen Zizhuang wasn't moved by Liu Dalin's reasoning. He said: "In my view, the Australians' method of selecting talent has nothing particularly brilliant about it. It's nothing more than the National Academy's selection system—an established method our dynasty already has."

He glanced at Yao Dian and Zhao Xunru and continued: "Brother Shengjin once served as Director of the Personnel Ministry's Document Selection Office, handling examinations and selections of civil officials by rank, listing, testing, screening, promotion, and transfer. Brother Housheng also came from the Personnel Ministry background. You must know the evolution of our dynasty's official selection process."

Yao Dian nodded while stroking his beard. "Indeed, Jisheng's observation is astute. When our dynasty's Taizu founded the nation, he established the National Academy to gather talents from throughout the realm. Academy students were divided into official students, meritorious nobility, and commoner students. Official students and meritorious nobility were sons of imperial and high official families. Commoner students were metropolitan examination failures who entered the Academy, or tribute scholars sent up from local government schools. Student qualifications, residence requirements, daily schedules, and practical training systems all had detailed regulations. The National Academy had specialized instructors who managed and supervised students' studies and lives. Students needed special imperial permission for leave or withdrawal. The Academy was divided into six halls in three tiers. Beginning students who had mastered the Four Books but not the Classics resided in the Zhengyi, Chongzhi, and Guangye halls. After eighteen months of study, those whose writing was clear and fluent advanced to Xiudao and Chengxin halls. After another eighteen months, those who had thoroughly mastered classics and histories with excellent composition advanced to Shuaixing Hall. Upon reaching Shuaixing, they accumulated points. The method: in the first month of each quarter, test one essay on one's Classic; in the second month, one discourse, plus one edict, proclamation, or memorial; in the third month, one essay on classics and history plus two legal judgments. For each test, those whose reasoning and composition were both excellent received one point; those strong in reasoning but weak in composition received half a point; those with errors received no points. Those accumulating eight points in a year graduated and received appointment. Those falling short continued studying in residence."

"Correct. Mathematics, astronomy, hydraulics, and other specialized subjects were all taught at the National Academy," Zhao Xunru continued. "I believe the practical training system was indeed a practical method. After completing their studies, Academy students were assigned to various government offices for hands-on experience in political affairs. After one or two years of practical training and satisfactory performance evaluations, they were sent to the Personnel Ministry awaiting appointment. This system was strictly enforced during the Hongwu and Yongle reigns and selected many talents for the court. After Xuande, as the imperial examinations flourished, the National Academy's selection system gradually fell into disuse. Yet officials in specialized positions like the Ministry of Works and Ministry of Revenue, particularly low-ranking ones, still must be Academy graduates handling practical affairs—this is because jinshi officials are unfamiliar with specific technical matters."

Liu Dalin said: "Knowing good methods exist yet failing to use them—this is the path to defeat."

Yao Dian said: "Currently, Academy students' quality is notoriously low—this is common knowledge. Moreover, the Academy teaches so many specialized subjects that students cannot fully understand Confucius's subtle teachings. How can they be appointed to high office?"

Liu Dalin smiled calmly: "Subtle teachings—can they be eaten? Can they repel enemies?"

"The current holy Son of Heaven is diligent and intelligent. He's merely been deceived by treacherous ministers. If he can steel his resolve and reform to become strong, the Great Ming still has hope for restoration." Chen Zizhuang said. Clearly, having once received the gift of shad fish from the Chongzhen Emperor and nearly entering the Grand Secretariat, he still held high hopes for Chongzhen.

"I fear this is Jisheng's wishful thinking," Liu Dalin said. "The root cause of the National Academy's decline—was it in the Xuande or Chenghua reigns? No, it was planted in the twenty-sixth year of Hongwu, when Emperor Taizu established the evaluation method for educational officials, using examination pass rates rather than annual tributes to assess instructors. Thus, instructors were bound to send their best students to the examinations to meet evaluation targets, and government school education pivoted toward examination preparation. During the Jingtai and Chenghua eras, the court was short of funds and opened a path of 'purchased enrollment'—Confucian scholars who contributed a set quota of grain and horses could enter the Academy. Purchased students only wanted to use the Academy as a stepping stone to officialdom. How could student quality be guaranteed? A short-sighted bad policy that lingered for two hundred years.

"By the twenty-ninth year of Hongwu, the six halls' students could no longer be distinguished by level. The advancement point system became a mere formality, and students simply waited their turn for practical training. The practical training system Brother Housheng mentioned, without point-based evaluation, had long become a matter of seniority. Most Academy students were provincial or metropolitan examination failures. After years of going through the motions, wasting time, aging and exhausted, how could they outperform jinshi upon taking office? When evaluating officials for promotion, how could they surpass jinshi? The Academy's accumulated burdens were insurmountable. By the Jingtai era, Ma Sheng and other non-jinshi officials were expelled from the Hanlin Academy and assigned provincial posts in Yunnan and Fujian. From then on, the custom formed that non-jinshi couldn't enter the Hanlin, non-Hanlin couldn't enter the Grand Secretariat, and high positions in the Northern and Southern ministries and court agencies required jinshi qualifications. All of you are jinshi—are you willing to let Academy students enter the Hanlin alongside you?"

When push comes to shove, buttocks determine brains. In the end, no one stood up to say "I'm willing" with a straight face.

Seeing the atmosphere turn uncomfortable, He Wuzhou smoothed things over with a laugh: "Ha ha ha, I thought we were all half in the grave, but it seems our blood still runs hot like young men's. Apparently we're all hale and hearty in old age. Since we still have fire in our bellies, why don't we have Mengliang tell us about the Australian military system? Our knowledge is limited to rumors. Anyone claiming to truly understand Australian affairs can't match Mengliang."
