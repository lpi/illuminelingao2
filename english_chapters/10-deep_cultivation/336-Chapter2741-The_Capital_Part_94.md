# Chapter 2741: The Capital (Part 93)

Wu Kaidi smiled. "Master, have you lost your head? Preparing gifts for the ladies of the house should be left to the two young ladies."

"Oh, right, right. I'm being silly." Leng Ningyun tapped his own forehead. "I'll go right now."

"One more thing." Wu Kaidi reminded him. "Mr. Li has done business with Lingao for years. What Australian goods hasn't he seen? The ordinary items I can prepare here probably won't interest him. Best to have something novel..."

"Right, Old Wu, you're correct." Leng Ningyun thought: Though Li Luoyou had a vulnerability, he was after all a merchant tycoon who navigated deftly between the Great Ming and the Later Jin. Reportedly a Catholic too, who was thick with the Portuguese. Back when the Senate held only the corner of Lingao on Hainan, he'd dared to invest. His vision, resolve, and courage far exceeded ordinary people's. What hadn't he seen? Just pressuring and threatening him for help would likely cause resentment—this old fox had kept the Senate at arm's length these past few years. Business continued, but the relationship was neither warm nor cold.

Though gifts weren't the decisive factor, sometimes they could serve as a catalyst or lubricant. Leng Ningyun immediately became serious. Returning to Yiqiang Studio, he took out Li Luoyou's file box from the archive cabinet.

It contained not only all his correspondence and records with Li Luoyou since arriving in the capital, but also all information the Foreign Intelligence Bureau had gathered on this person. Including details mentioned by Gu Baocheng during his activities in Lingao. Though fragmentary, they often touched on his private life, interests, and many other personal matters—especially precious.

Reading through carefully, he discovered Mr. Li had a chronic condition: vertigo.

Though doctors at Baireng Hospital had never measured his blood pressure, from Gu Baocheng's descriptions, observers' accounts, and his household servants' regular purchases of Suhexiang Decoction and Danshen Pills, he very likely had cardiovascular disease—possibly hypertension.

But Suhexiang Decoction and Danshen Pills had limited effectiveness for hypertension. Earlier, Baireng Hospital's pharmacy had specifically produced Danshen Drip Pills to improve efficacy, maximizing active ingredient concentration. But results remained unsatisfactory, until the pharmaceutical factory extracted reserpine from Rauvolfia and snakeroot plants—finally producing a truly effective antihypertensive.

Reserpine had significant side effects and was no longer a first-line antihypertensive in the new timeline, but in the 17th century, it was a genuine wonder drug. Liu Dalin's survival this long was largely due to accessing this medication in Lingao.

Leng Ningyun didn't have hypertension, but considering the capital's official and wealthy classes were mostly elderly, such geriatric conditions should be quite common. So he'd specially prepared some for building relationships.

However, giving medicine to others was quite risky. Especially for powerful and wealthy families, who regarded doctors as beneath notice. If the medicine worked like an elixir, fine; but if something went wrong, one would be blamed. So Leng Ningyun rarely gave it as gifts.

This time, he decided to use this "ultimate weapon." Li Luoyou had seen the world and was relatively accepting of new things. Giving this gift should win his favor.

He returned to the inner residence and called for Yanhong: "Bring the Liver-Soothing Pills. Prepare a three-month supply and deliver it to the inner study."

Reserpine that left Lingao came in Chinese medicine pill form. Besides reserpine, it contained eucommia, cow bezoar, danshen, and other herbs. It bore the Runshitang trademark, was named Liver-Soothing Elixir, came in small porcelain bottles, one bottle per month's supply.

Then he instructed Hexiang: "Go to the inner study and open the hidden compartment."

The hidden compartment in the inner study was designed as a curio cabinet, but sealed behind a wall, seamlessly fitted. Without unlocking it, one wouldn't know what was inside.

Opening the cabinet door, the variously sized compartments stored rare and precious objects seldom seen in the world. These were mostly used for gifts and relationship-building. Many came from Hong Huangnan's Lingao luxury brand "Línkof," though everyone still habitually called it "Shop 82."

These items were either wrapped in mulberry paper or stored in exquisite small boxes and pouches of various materials, with labels uniformly attached.

"This is for selecting gifts for Mr. Li Luoyou. Four items. One is medicine. For the other three, help me think."

"Is this the Mr. Li of Liaohai Trading?"

"That's him."

"This is difficult." Hexiang was also at a loss.

If just seeking costliness, there were many options. If seeking novelty, there were plenty of Western and Australian goods. But Li Luoyou was both wealthy and worldly. Things that would impress him were truly few.

She selected several items from the compartment and piled them on the table.

"Mr. Li is a worldly man who probably uses quill pens regularly. How about this fountain pen?"

Hexiang took out an exquisite small gilded leather box. It was a high-end fountain pen called "Mercury" from the Línkof and Technology Ministry's Taibai Observatory co-branded Stardust Generation I, produced by Shop 82. Not only had the nib material been significantly upgraded with notable improvements in wear resistance, but the barrel material had also advanced considerably, crafted from lapis lazuli with fine gold and silver inlay work. Extremely luxurious. The deep blue color was profound as distant space, with shimmering silver points on the surface like countless stars.

"This will do. As far as I know, Mr. Li often uses Western script."

"Then there's this." Hexiang took out a mulberry paper package and carefully opened it. Inside was an elaborate leather case containing a spring-driven gold pocket watch with jewel bearings. This was a genuine Lingao product, made less than a year ago.

Pocket watch production had begun two years earlier. But the initial watches, limited by materials and craftsmanship, were comparable to horse-hoof alarm clocks. Besides military and industrial applications, most people weren't interested in this clunky, imprecise device.

By contrast, this newly produced gold watch was very close to 18th-19th century pocket watch dimensions. The case was made of 75% gold, 12.5% silver, and 12.5% copper—beautifully colored with sufficient strength. The dial was white glass enamel; hands and numerals were blued. Inside the case was an inlaid fired enamel painting.

"Only four of these watches were sent from Lingao. None have been given out yet. You can't see them anywhere else. Heavy enough, right?" She carefully handed over the watch in its box, adding, "Be careful not to break it."

"Beautiful!" Leng Ningyun took it and examined it. "He really likes watches."

Li Luoyou was quite interested in timekeeping devices. He'd also purchased European pendulum grandfather clocks. But portable timekeepers like pocket watches didn't exist at the time. So when he saw the wristwatches worn by Senators, he expressed great interest, repeatedly offering to purchase one at high prices. At the time, since wristwatches couldn't be locally produced and both finished products and parts relied entirely on old-timeline stock, they were tier-one controlled items. That request couldn't be fulfilled.

"One more item. Speaking of rare things, a telescope probably doesn't count anymore, and he surely has a globe..."

"He has plenty of scientific instruments at home—Western and ours. Don't waste brainpower on that." Leng Ningyun was somewhat worried. Other things would interest him even less.

"How about another health medicine then? A matching pair." Hexiang said. "Since he has hypertension, his heart probably isn't good either. Runshitang's 'Musk Heart-Protecting Elixir' would be perfect."

"Good. Too extravagant might seem too formal."

"As for gifts for the concubine, that's easier." Hexiang said. "Looking at the files, this Madam Qiao is already middle-aged. The storeroom has premium donkey-hide gelatin made to tribute specifications."

"Good. What else?"

"Something more precious: a pair of sapphire earrings from Zizhen Studio."

Gemstones weren't highly valued in 17th-century China. Though used in jewelry, they weren't considered particularly precious. The main reason was limited cutting and processing capability—they couldn't achieve the multi-faceted cuts of later eras that created reflections and the dazzling "fire" effect.

After Zizhen Studio introduced new cutting techniques and technology, gemstone prices rose steadily. In just a few years, entirely new aesthetic tastes had spread to Jiangnan and the capital.

"Then fabrics." Hexiang began organizing the items on the table. "The storeroom has fine poplin and Xiangyan silk. Four bolts of each should be enough."

Both textiles were new products from the Senate's textile industry. The latter went without saying—it was a famous Guangdong product. Originally developed only in the early Republic era, it had now appeared ahead of time. The former, though called "poplin," was actually neither poplin nor silk, but high-count plain-weave cotton made from combed cotton at Guangzhou's textile factories. Light and smooth in texture, similar to silk.

With gifts prepared, the messenger Wu Kaidi had sent to deliver the visiting card returned, saying Mr. Li had time on the fourth and could meet.

"Still at Madam Qiao's residence?"

"Yes, but their steward said the Master isn't feeling well. He asks that you keep it brief."

This old fox really doesn't stand on ceremony! Leng Ningyun cursed silently.

"What's Madam Qiao's status beside Mr. Li?"

"If you're asking about favor, Li Luoyou's concubines don't have 'favor' to speak of." Wu Kaidi said. "His household is known for strict family rules—being a concubine is practically like being in prison. But this Madam Qiao has been with him over twenty years, so the relationship is deeper than with other concubines. When he's in the capital, he always stays at Madam Qiao's separate residence. Even during New Year, he only stays at the main house until the third."

"That's quite eccentric!"

"Not at all," Wu Kaidi laughed. "His parents and first wife have all passed. His children have grown and established their own families. There's nothing to do at home, but he has many brothers, nephews, and cousins who come daily for greetings, asking for positions and help. He finds them annoying. So he hides in the separate residence for peace and quiet."
