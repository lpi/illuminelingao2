# Chapter 2578 - Elder Du's Jealousy (Part 1)

News that Zhang Jiayu had successfully "sought medicine" and, through a stroke of fortune, become Zhang Xiao's "staff aide" quickly spread through the Shen'ao Study Society. It immediately caused a small sensation and also attracted much envy and jealousy. After all, the scholars gathered here, aside from a few with the purpose of "seeking knowledge," mostly harbored hearts full of ambition for fame and fortune, preparing to use the Study Society as a stepping stone to leap the dragon gate.

Now this young licentiate, just by seeking medicine, had won an Elder's appreciation and was immediately elevated to his side—this practically opened the door to advancement through favoritism.

Though advancement through favoritism had occurred throughout history, in the eyes of scholars and most officials it was a genuine pejorative, belonging to "breaking the rules." So while most people greatly admired Zhang Jiayu's talent and courage, they were quite displeased that he'd risen to a Chief's side through such means.

Naturally, there were also those who defended Zhang Jiayu, but these people were in the minority in the Shen'ao Study Society. For a time, the Society was abuzz with discussion.

This talk reached Cui Hantang's ears. Seeing public opinion in an uproar with signs of splitting the Society, he felt he should come out to calm the scholars' emotions. During the weekly "lecture" session, he brought this matter up and clarified that Zhang Jiayu was currently only an intern staff aide, not the "councillor" everyone was saying, much less a civil servant.

"...Moreover, I have to clarify one point. This young Zhang isn't following behind Zhang Xiao all day. Right now he's mainly staying at the hospital attending to his old mother. This is, uh... filial piety, yes—supreme filial piety! Zhang Xiao also saw this and gave him this opportunity. In the future, if he wants to be a civil servant in our Great Song, he'll still have to pass the examination. It's not like Zhang Xiao can make someone an official with just one word!" Then he changed tack: "You shouldn't complain either. Actually, this is great news for you all. It shows our Great Song Senate's Elders highly value the Study Society—look, isn't Zhang Jiayu an example?"

Advancement through favoritism broke the rules, which made everyone dislike it. But if it could fall on one's own head, that was another matter entirely. Cui Hantang's words temporarily calmed the students' emotions.

Seeing the students stop talking, Cui Hantang returned to his own "quiet room" and cursed to himself:

"Damn you, Medicine Master Zhang—you actually dare steal this Daoist's catch! If you weren't an Elder and I didn't have any Miao people around, I'd definitely put a gu curse on you. No, I can't swallow this anger. I must go have a word with you. Even if I can't get Zhang Jiayu back, I at least need to vent."

With that, he cracked his knuckles—crack, crack—and prepared to tidy up and go find Zhang Xiao for a chat, to give those skinny-as-a-stick shoulders of his a good patting.

But just as he was about to go out, he thought it over—he couldn't just let him off so easily. When you got down to it, he and Zhang Xiao were both Elders. They couldn't actually come to blows. Even giving him a hard time and making him need plasters for a few days wouldn't satisfy the hatred in his heart. Best to give Zhang Xiao something to worry about long-term...

---

He suddenly thought of his "cooperation partner." This Little Du was a "famous person collector," always planning to bag the "Three Loyalists of Lingnan." Of course, in Cui Hantang's view, Du Yibin's ideas were somewhat fantastical. But fantastical wasn't his concern. Zhang Jiayu being taken by Zhang Xiao—once Little Du knew, he'd certainly be very unhappy. He might as well contact him for some mischief-making.

With that thought, he immediately drafted a telegram and sent it to Du Yibin in Enping via the telegraph office.

"Goddamn it!" Du Yibin in Enping received this telegram and slapped his thigh hard. "My Jiayu got snatched by you?!" Then he tossed the telegram aside and loudly ordered: "Quick, prepare a boat for me. I'm returning to Guangzhou!"

Zhang Jiayu had originally come seeking him. Who'd have thought Zhang Xiao would pick up the slack? He had to find a way to get even.

Du Yibin looked at the fat Daoist's telegram with a "betrayed" expression: originally he'd already planned out how Zhang Jiayu would work for him, then have Zhang Jiayu believe in New Daoism and become a devotee, then make an appearance at some jiao ritual—that way old Cui would be fooled too. A perfect plan! But because he'd forgotten to bring his personal seal, he'd been snatched by Zhang Xiao. What the hell was this? At this thought, he decided to severely punish his life secretary tonight—who told her to forget his seal?

As for the staff around Du Yibin, they were all completely baffled. No one knew who this "Jiayu" was. Seeing Elder Du's behavior, they thought it was some romantic affair.

Having had someone snatched, he naturally wasn't willing to accept it. Daoist Cui's telegram meaning was very clear: inviting him to go raise a ruckus together.

But how exactly should this ruckus-raising work? Du Yibin was stumped. He couldn't carry on like Daoist Cui, all bold and unrestrained, with an "I'm just a rough fellow" or "straight up villain, take my axe!" attitude. There had to be a proper rationale.

After much thought, he decided Song Yingsheng was most suitable for this kind of thing. So he summoned him and explained the whole story.

"Zhang Jiayu is indeed an outstanding talent. Following County Magistrate Zhang wouldn't be wasting him." Song Yingsheng put on a regretful expression. "However, he simply wasn't fortunate."

These words were perfectly balanced, offending neither side, while also soothing Du Yibin's emotions.

Du Yibin didn't understand Song Yingsheng's tactics. Finding his words reasonable, he sighed:

"You're right. Unfortunately, among so many people in the Study Society, few of his age can compare. Such fine talent got taken by Zhang Xiao—I can't swallow this!" Du Yibin said huffily.

Song Yingsheng wasn't familiar with Zhang Jiayu—he was a Jiangxi talent who'd only served as Enping County Magistrate in Guangdong. Zhang Jiayu in Guangzhou was merely a licentiate with not much reputation to speak of. But this telegram had moved three Elders to all look favorably on him, plus this Chief Du's thinly-veiled jealousy—clearly he must be an outstanding young talent.

"Daoist Cui is unhappy. I'm also very unhappy. I'd originally planned to request him to come to me after he passed the civil service exam, but since he's already with Zhang Xiao, there's no way to ask for him back. Mr. Song, do you have any way to let that fat Cui—I mean Daoist Cui—vent some steam, and also make Zhang Xiao pay something?"

Song Yingsheng silently grumbled, thinking even if he were Guangdong's number one talent, it wouldn't warrant going this far! Really undignified!

He thought for a moment and said: "Since this matter is already settled for now, this student thinks there's no need to rush. If we go raise a ruckus now, we'd only damage harmony."

"Harmony my ass!" Du Yibin blurted out. Seeing Song Yingsheng's astonished face, he quickly said: "You keep talking!"

"Yes. Since Chief Zhang has already made him an intern staff aide, this matter isn't finalized yet—after all, a staff aide isn't an official. Um, Great Song civil servant." Song Yingsheng said.

"Mm-hmm. And then?"

"I recall the Chief telling this student that after Great Song civil servants pass the examination, they must all be assigned through the Cadre Department..."

"Exactly. Though some positions are designated, they still have to go through assignment procedures."

"That's it then." Song Yingsheng said. "This Zhang Jiayu will definitely pass next year's civil service examination. But if Chief Zhang wants to use him, he certainly won't have him apply for a specific designated position—nine times out of ten it'll be the 'administrative civil servant' general category..."

"Mr. Song, I didn't expect you to understand our Great Song's civil service system so well..." Du Yibin was somewhat surprised.

"These examination, selection, and appointment systems, though each dynasty has its own rules, are actually much the same. The Senate is no exception." Song Yingsheng smiled.

"You're right—this 'civil service examination' of various countries was originally copied from the imperial examinations." Du Yibin blurted another sentence, again exposing certain secrets without realizing it. "And after passing?"

"Since he's passed, the destination of these administrative civil servants, I've heard, is in the Cadre Department's hands. Even if Chief Zhang is a noble Elder, he probably can't interfere in such appointment matters, right?"

"Right, right, that makes sense!" Du Yibin understood his meaning. Zhang Xiao's so-called "intern staff aide" was essentially trying to claim the person early. But he was still an ordinary citizen now. Once he passed the civil service examination, he'd become the Cadre Department's "civil servant awaiting assignment." Exactly where he'd be assigned and under whom—that wasn't for Zhang Xiao alone to decide. He and Cui Hantang could work contacts to snatch the person back. Zhang Xiao would have nothing to say about it.

"Mr. Song, you're truly as talented as Zhuge Liang. Impressive, impressive." Du Yibin praised repeatedly.

Song Yingsheng thought to himself: finally fooled him again! This Chief's working ability was acceptable, but his political ability was really lacking. He knew very clearly that intercepting Zhang Jiayu after the civil service examination had very little chance of success. It was just a way to temporarily ease his mind. He guessed Chief Du still harbored some unwillingness, so he decided to add a bit more.

"Though Zhang Jiayu is temporarily gone, the Chief can still lock the barn after the horse has fled. Why not reply to Daoist Cui and have him select one or two students from the Study Society to serve as the Chief's staff aides? The Chief is about to take up the post in Zhaoqing—having a few more people to advise would certainly be useful. This way, not only would you win over the hearts of the Society members, you'd also attract more people to join the Society."

"But there's no one in the Society who can compare to him..."

Actually, whether there truly was no one, Du Yibin himself didn't know. But none of the Society members had a bigger reputation than Zhang Jiayu—that was certain.

"Even if there isn't, the Chief can still reap the benefits of buying a horse's bones for a thousand gold pieces. In the future, when recruiting talents, you'll be able to win people's hearts."

Du Yibin, having gotten this idea, felt somewhat better. Thinking it over, he asked: "Nothing going on in the county lately, is there?"

"Everything in the county is peaceful. Besides, aren't you about to be transferred to Zhaoqing, Chief?"

"I'll go back to Guangzhou for a bit," Du Yibin said. "Keep an eye on things for me these few days. Also, start preparing for the move."
