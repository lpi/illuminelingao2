# Chapter 2499: Burning the Building (Part 8)

"If only they could get us some Type 34s. Who the f**k wants this modified gadget called Type 36!" Wu Mu looked at the scene on the training ground, rather unhappy.

The Training Director beside him dared not join the conversation. He knew there was a big controversy about this matter within the Senate.

Regarding the issue of pistols, actually, both the Political Security and Police departments had quite a few complaints. Compared to the Fubo Army and the National Army, they frequently contacted and used revolvers. But after several years of actual combat testing, the effectiveness of the 1630 version revolver was widely questioned. These questions concentrated on the power of the pistol. There were even reports claiming that hitting enemy soldiers wearing thick cotton clothes several times at close range failed to knock them down. It completely failed to achieve the effect of penetrating ordinary armor within 20 meters as claimed by the Weapons Research Group.

However, the problem was dragged on. An obvious reason was that things like pistols were not an urgent task for the Ordnance Department. Until the Sun Umbrella Special Case occurred in 1634. During the post-event review, the National Police, Political Security Bureau, and the military criticized the existing military and police equipment, especially expressing many dissatisfactions with the Type 30 pistol. They believed not only was its ammunition lethality weak, but a more fatal shortcoming was the slow reloading speed, which caused heavy casualties among action personnel and almost led to the failure of the arrest operation.

Under the fierce pressure of the Senate, the pistol improvement project was quickly passed in the Planning Academy. To avoid repeating past mistakes, it was decided that two groups would carry out design work in parallel.

The final result was the production of two models, namely the 1630 Modified—which is the so-called Type 1636 they just received now—and the completely reborn Type 1634.

The design concept of the Type 1636 was still based on the Planning Academy's style of "waste utilization." In fact, the Type 1636 and Type 1630 did not change much. Changes were only made in ammunition specifications and mechanical mechanisms. Most of this pistol model was made by recycling and modifying the Type 1630s produced in the past. It was completely an attitude of not stopping until the surplus value was squeezed dry.

As for what the Second Weapons Group designed, it was more advanced because it was designed based on full metal cartridges from the beginning. Although it failed to get rid of black powder, at least it had comprehensive improvements in ammunition safety and ballistic performance.

The Type 1634 was actually based on the S&W No. 3 pistol as a blueprint, equipped with a more reliable safety mechanism and optimized ergonomic design. Its break-open frame and automatic shell ejection rod design greatly improved the speed of reloading and filling, making it very convenient to use. The prototype gun quickly entered the testing stage and was finalized as the Type 1634 revolver at the end of the year, abbreviated as "Type 34 Pistol."

The blueprint for the Type 34 pistol cartridge was also the .44 Russian (11x25mmR) bullet. While ensuring stopping power, it took into account that recoil was within a bearable range. coupled with the heavy weight of the whole gun, the controllability of the Type 1634 pistol shooting was quite laudable. An episode occurred during this: The Planning Academy proposed to use paper cartridge bullets similar to the Type 1636 based on inherited inherent ammunition specifications to save copper material. But the Navy and Marine Corps fiercely opposed this suggestion, pointing out that paper cartridges stored in pistol cylinders were easily dampened in maritime operating environments. moreover, issues of self-ignition prevention and loading speed were still not solved. What was the point of equipping another kind of revolver then?

Finally, considering that the tension of copper material supply had greatly eased after monopolizing trade with Japan, and continuing to use past old designs would also affect the service life of the gun, the Planning Academy finally decided the Type 34 .44 caliber pistol cartridge would adopt full copper cartridge cases and Boxer primers to facilitate cartridge reloading.

It can be imagined that due to cost relations, the Type 34 was not widely equipped. The first batch to receive equipment was the Fubo Army General Reconnaissance Bureau and the Senate General Guard Bureau. Later, Navy and Marine Corps officers and some officers of the South China Army were also equipped. As for the National Police and Political Security Bureau, these two departments, what they got was this Type 36 with a new face but old content.

Naturalized citizen cadres generally dared not complain about the Senate's decisions, but the complaints among Senators were unreserved. The Training Director himself had participated in many light weapon shooting and tactical trainings undertaken by the Special Reconnaissance Team and had seen many real "Australian Goods," so he also had criticisms about this modified Type 36. Seeing the superior's disgusted face, he naturally understood his psychological activity.

A clerk walked over quickly and said to Wu Mu: "Director Wu, Section Chief Yang is waiting for you in your office. There is a situation to report to you." Wu Mu nodded and walked quickly to the office.

With a *bang*, Wu Mu pushed the door and entered. Yang Cao and Xu Tong in the room had been waiting for a long time. seeing him enter, they bowed slightly as if to stand up. Wu Mu pressed his hand down to signal them to sit, then took a seat and asked: "What is the situation?"

Yang Cao said: "That batch of purchased things in the city was sent away."

Wu Mu immediately became spirited: "Oh? Who received the goods?"

Yang Cao said: "It was externally hired carts and people. They unloaded at a village twenty *li* away from the city. After being parked for two days, they were picked up."

Wu Mu said: "Found out the destination?"

Yang Cao said: "Very difficult. Among the receivers were local *Dan* households (boat people) who are very familiar with local river channels and bays. Our people have limited knowledge of the local river situation and couldn't follow. to avoid exposure and also for safety, people were withdrawn. However, there is a major discovery."

Wu Mu said: "Tell me."

Yang Cao said: "There were Heavenly Soldiers among the people receiving goods."

Wu Mu was surprised: "Heavenly Soldiers?"

From this name, he probably already knew this was a secret society organization. The Political Security Bureau probably learned about some such organizations in their understanding of local social conditions. However, secret society organizations had never been flourishing in Guangdong and Guangxi since ancient times, far less powerful than their northern counterparts. Because local clan forces were very strong, secret societies could hardly win over bottom-layer commoners through the means of "mutual aid," so they didn't become a climate.

Yang Cao said: "It is a local Daoist sect called the Heavenly Gate Daoist Society. When it arose is unverifiable. It has existed in the countryside since ancient times and spread widely. Members call themselves Heavenly Soldiers. During combat, heads are tied with red scarves, knives wrapped with red ribbons, spears gathered with red tassels, and bodies draped with local cloth strips written with 'Daoist God Disciples Protected by Heaven and Earth.' Members are mostly Hakkas, *Dan* households renting sandy fields, landless hired laborers, artisans, and so on. Initially, it had the nature of uniting for self-protection. After the shelling of Guangzhou, bandits rose in swarms. The Heavenly Gate Daoist Society took advantage of the situation to grow under the name of 'defending soil and resisting bandits.' They successively knocked out three bands of bandits of dozens of people—Yitang Feng, Pushan Hu, and Guo Longbei—dominating a region and gaining great fame, attracting a large number of personnel to join. It is a landlord armed force in the hands of local forces. These people usually live and farm in the countryside, no different from ordinary commoners. They only gather when there are matters. So it is difficult to identify them usually."

Wu Mu already started to having a headache because this kind of organization was not simple bandits. The structure was loose and extremely "civilianized," making it very hard to distinguish. If there were no criminal acts, it was also not good to directly adopt coercive measures.

"...After we occupied Guangdong, they did not confront the Senate and also cooperated with our local work. So our usual work didn't touch their organizational activities."

Wu Mu waved his hand: "Is there intelligence on specific structure and organization?"

"This is the relevant intelligence." Yang Cao handed over the prepared dossier. Wu Mu flipped through it. The introduction content about this secret society was very brief.

"...The head of the society is called Heavenly Gate Marshal, internally called Seat Marshal, also called Helmsman or Helm Master. The deputy is called Chief Seal, also called Assistant Helmsman, assisting in leading congregation members of various sides. Below the Society Head, it is divided into eight gates. The Merit Gate is the head of all gates, also in charge of personnel promotion and demotion; the Punishment Gate manages sect rules and commandments; the Grain Gate manages finance; the Executive Gate manages general affairs; the Ritual Gate manages ceremonies; the Wind Gate manages reconnaissance and reporting; the Soldier Gate manages killing and fighting. It possesses certain organization but is overall relatively loose. Society heads of various villages basically act on their own. It has strong superstitious color, fooling commoners with gods and ghosts. Key positions in the society are basically held by important figures of local forces. Wealthy households and gentry often join to serve as society heads to seek safety or expand strength. Big disciples in charge of various gates are called Teaching Disciples, who must clear their backgrounds and pass grand ceremonies before they can officially hold positions in the society."

Judging from the materials, this organization had no serious crimes. Even the scale of "wealth accumulation" consistent with such organizations was not large. If there was a biggest problem, it was frequent involvement in local armed fights. And local armed fights were interwoven with local clan conflicts and conflicts between locals and Hakkas. It was also hard to say who was right and who was wrong.

It was really a strange thing how such an obviously bottom-layer-oriented secret society could collude with a genuine local gentry like Liang Cunhou.

"Liang Cunhou very likely made friends with some local power factions in the local periphery through the Martial Team, and these secret societies in their hands are the armed forces he covets. Since we implemented public security rectification in the Liangguang region, after two consecutive periods of rectification, bandit and pirate groups in the Pearl River Delta region have basically been completely cleared. It is no longer feasible to construct armed forces through the traditional method of contacting bandit classes. So Liang Cunhou put his mind on them. Their anti-court color was originally relatively weak; in their bones, they still think the Great Ming is orthodox."

Yang Cao paused and said: "But overall, their organization is not very tight, and internally it is not a monolithic block. Many well-off wealthy households only want to organize able-bodied men to guard their native land, fearing other forces intervening locally would increase burdens, and unwilling to wade into the muddy water of anti-Song. This gives us great room to carry out winning-over work. In the countryside, some gentry moved closer to us in time, actively expressing willingness to act as our ears and eyes. Among them, there is no lack of Teaching Disciples of the Heavenly Gate Way. This allows us to obtain some valuable intelligence. This was provided to us yesterday by Li Baiqing of Old Li's Walled Village in Dongguan." After speaking, she handed a letter to Wu Mu.

Wu Mu took it and looked carefully. It was a hard paper card 8 *cun* long and 4 *cun* wide. Written on top: Public Alliance Precious Card. Written in the middle:

Reporting to Heavenly Emperor
Summoning generals to dispatch troops
...
Heaven and Earth as witness
Ghosts and Gods as proof
Written below: Meeting at X place on X day X month to discuss grand plans together. Heavenly Gate Daoist Society Seat Marshal: Xue Tu bows in greeting to await all brothers.

Wu Mu flipped it over and looked a few times: "This is their internal gathering card?"

Yang Cao said: "Yes, and it is a formal alliance public card, very rare. unless there are major matters, it will not be issued lightly. This time, all Great Heads of various counties received the public card. This Xue Tu is currently the Chief Helm Master of the Heavenly Gate Way."
