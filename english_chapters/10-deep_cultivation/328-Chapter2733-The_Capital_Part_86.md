# Chapter 2733: The Capital (Part 85)

Before he could finish speaking, he felt a wave of dizziness and some nausea. Li Rufeng hurried to say, "Chief, the drug's effects haven't worn off yet. You should drink this soup first and rest well. Since you're out of danger, there's no rush."

Leng Ningyun nodded weakly. "You're right."

Li Rufeng returned to the office. He sent someone to deliver the letter while handling the matters at hand. The wounded needed a doctor; the two fallen escort masters needed coffins; they also had to find a place to report to the authorities for an inquest before the bodies could be coffined. Heliansheng had both face and connections in the capital—none of this was difficult—but proper procedure had to be followed.

He was busy when an escort master quietly approached and whispered, "Chief Escort, Little Bazi is fading. Would you like to see him?"

"I'll go right now."

His heart tightened. He immediately set aside his work and went to a side room in the back courtyard.

Little Bazi was propped up on the *kang*, his upper body bare. Though bandaged, blood was seeping through in large patches. Beside the *kang* sat the innkeeper's wife, constantly wiping the blood foam from the corners of his mouth with a hot towel.

"What's the prognosis?"

"The lung meridians are damaged. Even Hua Tuo would have no solution," the doctor said in a low voice. "If not for the wound medicine stopping the bleeding temporarily, he wouldn't have lasted this long."

"The bleeding can't be stopped now?"

"No. The meridians are damaged. Even the best wound medicine is useless now," the trauma doctor said helplessly. "If you have anything to say, say it quickly. I think he still has something on his mind."

Li Rufeng nodded and dismissed the doctor. He came to the bedside. The innkeeper's wife said Little Bazi's mind was drifting—sometimes lucid, sometimes confused.

"Did he say anything?"

"He said he wants to see his godmother."

"Anything else?"

"He said his parents are calling him to come over in the courtyard." The innkeeper's wife said uneasily. "This child is probably about to depart. He doesn't even have proper clothes."

"Go tell the innkeeper to prepare clothes and burial items for Little Bazi. Add one more coffin."

He'd still held a thread of hope for Little Bazi's injuries. But seeing blood foam coming from his mouth, he knew there was no saving him now.

He called softly, "Little Bazi! Little Bazi! I'm Chief Escort Li."

To his surprise, Little Bazi actually opened his eyes. They were bright and alert. Seeing Li Rufeng, a look of joyful surprise spread across his face.

"Chief Escort!" he said softly. "Grand Manager Leng..."

"Safe." Li Rufeng nodded, speaking gently. "How do you feel?"

"Much more comfortable than before. Breathing easier." Even as he spoke, blood foam flowed from the corner of his mouth. Li Rufeng quickly wiped it away. "Just now I dreamed of my parents. They wanted me to come over. I said, how could that place be as good as Lingao? Lady Sanniang told me Lingao is paradise on earth... ordinary people have food to eat and don't get bullied... My parents even got angry..." At this point, he actually smiled faintly.

"Yes, yes," even iron-hearted Li Rufeng felt his eyes moisten slightly. He knew this was the final rally before death. "When you're better, we'll go to Lingao together and see..." He steadied himself. "In this rescue of Grand Manager Leng, you earned the highest merit! If not for you, Senator Leng might have been harmed by the villains. When Liao Sanniang hears, she'll be so pleased—not in vain that she took you as a godson."

"I was just afraid... *cough cough cough*..." Little Bazi coughed up more blood foam. He looked weary. "Just afraid, afraid I'd disgrace my godmother..."

Li Rufeng wiped away the blood foam. "Don't worry. With you as her godson, she'll have something to boast about for a long time."

Little Bazi smiled faintly. "That's good, that's good." He closed his eyes. "I'm tired. This time, I earned the top merit..." His voice gradually faded to nothing.

Li Rufeng sat beside him for a long while. He watched as the color slowly drained from his face. He tested for breath at the nose—already stopped. He heaved a long sigh and stood up, just as the innkeeper's wife came in with clothes.

"Find two people. Draw a basin of hot water and wash him before dressing him."

"This child—what a pity."

"Being an escort master, a 'striker.' This is the end you get!" Li Rufeng sighed with emotion. "Trading your life for the safety of the wealthy and their money! May he be reborn into a better life."

News of Leng Ningyun's rescue was transmitted within 24 hours to all teams operating in and around the capital, and also to Lingao and Guangzhou.

The person was back safely—naturally a good thing. Normally, the matter would have ended there. Even without finding the mastermind, the Foreign Intelligence Bureau had no intention of digging deeper or "eradicating evil completely." After all, in the current historical environment, such things weren't unusual. There was no need to spend too much manpower and resources to eliminate them. As for the tangled relationships involved, they couldn't be bothered to sort them out.

But Min Zhanlian's squad's discoveries excited both the Foreign Intelligence Bureau and the Political Security Bureau. Because this matter not only involved political conspiracy but also the "Stone Elder Group" that had long troubled the Senate. Especially now that there was direct evidence proving the Stone Elder Group was behind this kidnapping.

With this development, the original Senator kidnapping case was immediately upgraded to an extremely important case. Under orders from the State Council, the Foreign Intelligence Bureau and Political Security Bureau dispatched additional capable personnel to proceed to the capital for investigation.

Unlike before, when no Senator was sent, this time it was decided to assign a Senator to come directly to the capital to command operations, using the clues exposed by the case to capture the Stone Elder Group in one sweep.

But for Leng Ningyun, who had just escaped danger, his most pressing matter was restoring Delong's commercial reputation.

After he was kidnapped, Wu Kaidi had avoided a run on Delong and prevented its collapse through a "proactive seal." It was a brilliant move.

But the aftereffects were quite severe. Though the seal was initiated by the authorities, as a manager allowing such a situation to occur could be called "poor management"—a serious blow to commercial credibility. This was directly reflected in Delong's banknotes. The market exchange rate had fallen to only one-seventh of face value. And it was dropping every day, trending toward worthlessness.

The immediate tasks were: first, to unseal immediately, resume all exchange business, and rebuild market confidence; second, to gather enough silver to weather the coming run.

The latter worried Leng Ningyun more. After years of operation, Delong had outstanding deposit slips and banknotes worth four or five hundred thousand taels. Once they reopened, many depositors, simply worried about Delong's stability, would certainly rush to redeem. 

From Wu Kaidi, he learned that during his captivity, Shanxi House had bought over one hundred thousand taels worth of Delong notes at low prices. Adding other depositors, a rough estimate suggested that once a run started, it would be hard to survive without three hundred thousand taels of silver.

Right now, they had less than half that amount. They needed to gather more silver.

"The one hundred thousand taels in deposits from Eunuch Yang will probably be withdrawn the moment we open." Wu Kaidi smiled bitterly. "He's already sent people to give me a heads-up. In reality, we can only redeem about fifty thousand."

Leng Ningyun's brows furrowed deeply. He said nothing. Though he didn't have the ledgers in hand, he knew the bank's operations by heart. Wu Kaidi probed, "Should we ask headquarters for help? Get some silver transferred from Tianjin or Dengzhou?"

"I'm afraid headquarters can't help either. Never mind Tianjin and Dengzhou branches—even if they emptied the Guangzhou vault for me, they couldn't come up with one hundred fifty thousand taels."

"What about the Reserve Bank?" Wu Kaidi said.

"They're having difficulties too." Though Leng Ningyun wasn't in Guangzhou, he was well aware of the Reserve Bank's current over-issuance of silver yuan notes. They were barely keeping their own heads above water.

But he couldn't say this to Wu Kaidi, lest it shake his nearly blind faith in the Senate.

The two spent hours in the study calculating over and over, racking their brains for where else they could gather silver. Suddenly, Wu Kaidi said, "I do have one idea, though it's not exactly proper."

"What idea?" Leng Ningyun was curious.

"Didn't you once say that the anti-counterfeiting measures on Ming banknotes are beneath contempt?"

Leng Ningyun, clever as he was, immediately understood.

"You mean counterfeit Shanxi House's banknotes?"

"Exactly! We make a few and show them. Tell them not to run on us, or else we'll flood the market with millions of Shanxi House notes and bring everyone down together!"

"As an idea, it does have merit. But how do we identify which customers are from Shanxi House?"

Wu Kaidi was momentarily at a loss.

"This option is only for when we have no other way out," Leng Ningyun shook his head.

"Then what else can we do?"

"There's only one way." Leng Ningyun said. "Go negotiate with them."

"Negotiate?"

"Negotiate." Leng Ningyun affirmed.

"But your ordeal this time—Shanxi House was involved. Now that you've returned safely, they have a chance to bankrupt Delong through a run. Why would they agree? This is seeking skin from a tiger."

"What you say makes sense. But I've returned safely. The conspiracy has failed. This must be a big blow to the Shanxi men. In the end, they're just after money. Kicking someone when they're down is risk-free. But if it comes to real confrontation, they might not have the guts."

Seeing Wu Kaidi still didn't quite understand, he continued: "Think about it. How many forces did they secretly mobilize for this kidnapping? And still, I came back. And I'm going to keep running the bank. Aren't they afraid I'll tear off all pretenses with them too? I'm not just some merchant from Guangdong. Behind me stands the Short-Hairs!"

"Exactly. It's the same idea as your counterfeit notes. You want to push me into the river; I'll drag you in with me, and we'll all drown together!" Leng Ningyun said fiercely. "Right now, the table is only half-flipped. If they really bring down Delong, aren't they afraid the Short-Hairs will retaliate? Maybe we'll 'invite' them to be our 'Gods of Wealth' too."

At this, Wu Kaidi felt as if the clouds had parted. He said happily, "You're right, boss! What do we have to fear?! At worst, we send the Special Reconnaissance Team to pull back their covers!"
