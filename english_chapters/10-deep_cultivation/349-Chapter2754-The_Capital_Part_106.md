# Chapter 2754: The Capital (Part 106)

The audience, originally intended for half a *shichen* (one hour), actually extended to nearly one *shichen* (two hours) under the questions and answers. It was only when Wang Dehua came over to whisper a reminder that there were other arrangements later that Chongzhen realized so much time had passed.

At this moment, his mood was very high. Yang Sichang had just offered a strategy to wipe out the roving bandits, and now a person who "knew the Kun" had fallen from the sky. It seemed that the restoration of the Great Ming was the will of Heaven!

The key was that this person not only "knew the Kun," but from the conversation just now, it could be seen that this person was clear-headed and meticulous in thought—a truly practical and capable talent!

Such a person would definitely be of great use when the time came to suppress the Kun!

Thinking of this, he said: "Zhen already knows about the matters you spoke of. You will certainly be given an explanation."

"Thank you, Your Majesty, for your profound grace!"

"You know the Kun situation deeply. Staying in the position of an Inspector is truly a waste of talent." The Emperor thought for a moment, "The Imperial Court has issued a decree to select talents without sticking to one pattern. It is a pity you are not a *Xiaolian* (Filial and Incorrupt / Provincial Graduate)..."

If he were a *Juren* (Provincial Graduate), promotion would be easy. Sun Yuanhua was a *Juren* and became the Governor of Denglai a few years ago.

"It is always this humble subject's incompetence." Qian Taichong felt a burst of wild joy; it seemed the Emperor not only wanted to uphold justice for him but also wanted to promote him.

"You may withdraw..." The Emperor said, then suddenly remembered something, "Where is your lodging now?"

"This humble subject originally lived in the Fujian Guild Hall in the Capital."

"Go back there to stay as before. Do not leave the Capital without a decree."

This meant there would be a decree later. Qian Taichong, both excited and terrified, knelt down and kowtowed, then withdrew.

Coming out of the palace, the Jinyiwei officers escorting him were very polite and sent him back to the Fujian Guild Hall in a small sedan chair. The manager of the guild hall had been feeling uneasy ever since he was taken away, fearing that some "unresponsive" matter would be interrogated and implicate the guild hall. Seeing the officers send the person back in a sedan chair at this moment, he finally set his mind at rest.

Before leaving, the officers also instructed him to "take good care of Master Qian." The manager agreed repeatedly. Watching the officers leave, the manager couldn't suppress his curiosity and asked about the experiences of the past few days.

Qian Taichong was full of joy and originally wanted to spit it all out, but thinking that this matter involved the Emperor, he should still be cautious in his speech. If a comment of being "frivolous" reached the Emperor's ears, he wouldn't be able to escape it.

He said immediately: "There is now a prospect for the matter I came to the Capital to handle."

He had been delayed in the Capital for more than half a year to handle affairs, leaving early and returning late every day, and hadn't seen a smiling face more than a few times in several months.

The manager suddenly realized and cupped his hands: "Congratulations, congratulations! Presumably, Master has found a channel this time! Things are easy to handle with a channel!" After speaking, he lowered his voice and asked, "I'm afraid it's a big shot in the court?"

"Exactly! Exactly!" Qian Taichong couldn't suppress the joy in his heart. "I accept your auspicious words!"

Qian Taichong was in high spirits upon meeting a happy event. Seeing that it was still early, he asked the manager to order some wine and dishes; he wanted to organize his thoughts while drinking.

The manager was very capable. Before long, a fellow brought wine and dishes in a food box. Since he was drinking alone, there were only four small dishes, two dishes to go with rice, and a plate of "rolls."

At this moment, snowflakes were fluttering outside the window; heavy snow was falling in the Capital again. Qian Taichong simply left the window open, admiring the snow and drinking by himself. This was the first time in years he felt so at ease. Not only because he had gained the Emperor's attention, but also because the Emperor had the intention to deal with the Kun scoundrels.

The Zheng family's current predicament was ultimately caused by the Kun scoundrels. As long as the Kun scoundrels' momentum declined, the various scattered branches of the Zheng clique would naturally compete overseas instead of fighting in Zhangzhou Bay.

In today's audience, the Emperor was very interested in the Kun scoundrels and asked for a lot of news about them. Qian Taichong discovered that although the Kun scoundrels had already taken the land of two provinces and their momentum far exceeded that of ordinary bandits, the Emperor knew very little about them.

True, he thought. Let alone the Emperor sitting high at the top, even in Fujian, which was now a "frontline" province, Kun goods had long been everywhere. Kun ships loading cargo could be seen at the docks in Zhangzhou and Quanzhou—though nominally they were all guest merchants of the Great Ming.

But the officials and gentry mostly knew nothing about the Kun scoundrels. At most, they only knew clichés like sturdy ships and sharp cannons, or exquisite appliances.

As long as the Imperial Court was determined to suppress them, mobilizing a great army for a southern expedition to destroy the Kun scoundrels might not be achievable, but it shouldn't be difficult to dampen their arrogance slightly. After all, the Great Ming was a colossus; how could mere Kun scoundrels be mentioned in the same breath?

At the height of his drinking, Qian Taichong already vaguely had various illusions of entering the court to offer congratulations as a meritorious minister, receiving the Emperor's rewards, and returning home to bring glory to his ancestors...

Suddenly, there was a gentle knocking on the door. Qian Taichong thought it was the manager and said: "The door isn't bolted, just come in."

With a "creak," the double door opened. The person who entered was not the manager, but a strange young man.

He lived in the guild hall for peace and quiet, unlike inns where people came and went, and idle people entered rooms everywhere.

Qian Taichong was a bit dazed from drink and asked after a while: "Who is the gentleman?"

The young man smiled slightly and said: "We are strangers."

"Since we are strangers, why visit late at night?"

"Although strangers, we have a common enemy."

At this point, Qian Taichong sobered up halfway, immediately realizing that this person did not barge in randomly but came prepared. Unknowingly raising his guard, he said: "This student doesn't know what you mean..."

"Mr. Qian, you have been in the Capital for eight months; I don't need to say more about why you came. Today's audience in the Yufang Pavilion means your great ambition can be fulfilled. Congratulations."

This time, the wine Qian Taichong drank turned into cold sweat, instantly oozing out from his back. The feeling of tipsiness dissipated completely. He asked sternly: "Who are you?!" As he spoke, he tried to reach for the precious sword behind his back.

"Mr. Qian, don't panic." The young man smiled. "I have no malice in coming here. Just some matters I wish to discuss with you."

Qian Taichong's brain spun fast. He had just had an audience with the Emperor today, and this person knew about it that night. Obviously, he was not an ordinary character; maybe he was from the Factory Guard (Dongchang/Jinyiwei), or perhaps a noble eunuch?

"What does this have to do with Your Excellency?"

"Sir knows the Kun situation deeply. The Imperial Court will definitely have great use for you when employing troops in the future. But has Sir ever thought about the military strength when Governor Wang attacked the Kun scoundrels back then?"

"The military strength was powerful."

"Did the Kun scoundrels have today's grand situation back then?"

"Far inferior to today."

"Since it is so. If the Imperial Court employs troops, why does Sir think it won't repeat Governor Wang's disaster?"

This question pointed straight to Qian Taichong's heart. He was someone who had fought the Kun scoundrels and stayed in Lingao for two years; of course, he knew that today was not like the past. Compared to a few years ago, the Kun scoundrels were even more powerful.

Back then, with a mere county's land and a few thousand infantrymen without even armor, they annihilated more than twenty thousand elites of the Guangdong official army. Now they have occupied Liangguang. At sea, north to Tianjin Wei and south to Guangzhou Prefecture, the flags of the Kun scoundrels flutter everywhere, and the fleet billowing black smoke enters uninhabited realms.

Even if the Imperial Court can mobilize an army of one hundred thousand, so what?

Thinking of this, he suddenly sat down heavily, the fine wine and delicacies before him becoming tasteless.

He hesitated, looked up with some doubt, and asked: "What is your intention in saying these things, sir?"

A flash of light suddenly appeared in his mind, and he said with a tremble: "Could it be, could it be, could it be you are a Kun... scoundrel!"

In this instant, the panic of fleeing during the defeat at Chengmai, the fear of being captured, the humiliation of being escorted to Lingao for hard labor, the shock of witnessing the power of the Kun scoundrels... all floated up!

Probably seeing the fear in Qian Taichong's eyes, the visitor sighed slightly and said: "I am not a Kun scoundrel; Sir, please relax. I came today with a few heartfelt words."

"Yes, yes, please enlighten me."

"Sir's hospitality..."

Qian Taichong then came back to his senses and hurriedly said: "Sit, please sit. Forgive me, forgive me."

Only then did the young man take a seat. His demeanor was very calm. Seeing that Qian Taichong was still somewhat distracted, he smiled and said: "Sir, do not be suspicious. I am irreconcilable with the Kun scoundrels. Knowing that Sir has the heart to resist the Kun, I came to chat."

Qian Taichong finally settled down, wiped the cold sweat from his forehead, and said: "Sir came... indeed too suddenly..."

"Kun scoundrel spies and informants are everywhere in the Capital; I had to act like this." The young scholar whispered, "There are no outsiders here; we can talk in secret."

"I wonder about Sir's name..."

"My surname is Le," the young man said. "Of course, it is a false name."

Such frankness made Qian Taichong stunned. He heard the other party continue: "I am an old acquaintance of the Kun scoundrels. I hate the Kun scoundrels to the bone. I have to be like this."

Qian Taichong expressed understanding immediately and asked about the purpose of the visit again.

"Sir had an audience with the Emperor today and spoke much about the inside information of the Kun scoundrels. Presumably, Sir also understands the Emperor's intention."

"Yes, the Emperor seems to have the intention to punish the Kun." Qian Taichong said, "The Kun scoundrels have now become a heart's disease of the Imperial Court, but the gentlemen of the Imperial Court are still ignorant and haven't seen the big picture clearly!"

"Sir speaks correctly. Until, this act of punishing the Kun must absolutely not be done!"

Qian Taichong was puzzled: "Since they are a heart's disease, why can it not be done? The Kun scoundrels occupy Liangguang, collecting all the money, grain, and population of Liangguang. Given time, their power will become stronger. If the Imperial Court appeases them blindly, won't the Kun scoundrels become unstoppable in the future..."

"Sir speaks correctly. But if the official army punishes the Kun, there is ten deaths and no life! How much money, grain, and troops does the Imperial Court have now to withstand such a setback? Once the elites are lost, and the roving bandits and Eastern Barbarians rise again taking the opportunity, where will the Imperial Court go to raise money and grain and train troops again?"

Qian Taichong was speechless for a moment. With his experience and knowledge, he naturally couldn't say the Imperial Court would definitely win. but psychologically he was still very resistant to the outcome that the official soldiers would definitely be defeated. He hesitated and said: "It won't come to that, right?"

Thinking again, form the time Wang Zunde was defeated at Chengmai until now, fires rose in four places and smoke in eight directions for the Imperial Court. Not counting small groups of roving bandits and mobs, just the roving bandits in the Central Plains, the chieftains in the Southwest, and the Jianzhou outside the pass meant fighting almost every day. How many elite soldiers could be left? If defeated in Guangdong, and the elites drawn from various places were completely lost, the subsequent situation could be imagined.

Thinking of this, he couldn't help but be stunned, muttering: "Punishing the Kun is defeat, defending is also defeat. What is to be done?"
