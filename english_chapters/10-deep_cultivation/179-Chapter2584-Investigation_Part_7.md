# Chapter 2584 - Investigation (Part 7)

Several dozing passengers nearby showed displeasure, and a few unfamiliar villagers in front and back even started scolding: "What brat is this, making such a racket!"

"My chickens aren't laying in their coop—can you afford to pay for that?!"

...

A man who looked like a medicine peddler, carrying a medicine basket and hung with various odds and ends, explained from the side: "This seems to be the fool son from that landlord Huang Danna's family!"

Of course, Yuan Shuzhi had no idea whether there was a landlord named Huang Danna in Huangxi, much less whether this was his fool son.

"Fifteen wen to Tangxia!" The boatwoman collecting fares quoted a price.

The fool first pulled out several one-wen and two-wen paper notes to buy a ticket. The boatwoman naturally said it wasn't enough. The fool then kept digging out money. This time what he produced was a somewhat familiar-looking paper bill. Old Yuan didn't see it clearly, but it seemed to be a silver dollar certificate—except the denomination was ten yuan.

This was rare indeed. After the Senate abolished the tael and switched to yuan, the purchasing power of one silver dollar was quite substantial. Yuan Shuzhi's formal monthly income was only a few yuan. In daily life, people mostly used "fen" and "wen" notes.

Yuan Shuzhi frowned. In his memory, he'd never seen a ten-yuan silver dollar certificate. The largest denomination paper money he'd normally see was one yuan, and a one-yuan note was equivalent to a thousand wen. Ten yuan was a huge sum.

Where did this ten-yuan denomination note come from? He couldn't help but feel puzzled.

"Is this enough money?" The fool waved the note and was about to hand it to the boatwoman when suddenly a man who looked like a peddler snatched the money, saying urgently: "Brother, I'll pay your boat fare—just give me that note!"

He'd been cursing the fool very enthusiastically just moments ago, but now suddenly wanting to pay for someone—the rapid change in attitude left the entire boat astounded.

The medicine peddler suddenly said: "Hey there, what kind of money are you holding? Let everyone take a look!"

The peddler just stuffed the money into his robe, ignoring him—looking exactly like someone who'd found a bargain treasure.

A man with short Baldy hair wearing an "Australian jacket" seated at the back of the boat then said leisurely: "Brother who's exchanging money, that note is a new ten-yuan bill issued by the Great Song. One note can exchange for ten big silver dollars. You should have some conscience—you can't swindle this young fellow!"

"Where'd you come from, butting in on what's none of your business!" The peddler cursed, looking completely unreasonable.

The short-haired Australian-dressed man smiled slightly and said: "When I see injustice, I naturally intervene." As he spoke, he took out a waist badge and flashed it.

The peddler sneered: "You think waving some badge can scare people?"

The medicine peddler beside him took the badge, looked at it, and exclaimed in alarm: "You're from the Great Song's Directorate of Intelligence?!" Then he quickly urged the peddler:

"Since ancient times, commoners don't fight officials. Say less! This is a Great Song official!" With that, he passed the badge over.

The peddler took the badge and looked at it, showing a guilty but unwilling-to-back-down expression. He stiffened his neck and said: "Who knows what kind of office that is! So you're saying this note is really worth ten big silver dollars?" He handed the badge back to the medicine peddler, who immediately returned it to the fake-Baldy man. The whole process was swift, like a butterfly flitting through flowers.

"It's absolutely real." This "Australian cadre" had a composed air. "You can pay for this young fellow's ticket, but you can't just cheat him out of his money."

But the peddler still looked unwilling to concede, saying: "You say it's worth ten yuan so it's worth ten yuan?! This ten-yuan note never existed on the market before. He just pulls it out to buy things—who knows if it's real or fake? I'm spending fifteen wen helping him buy a ticket, exchanging for a note of unknown authenticity—I'm doing a good deed!"

The fake-Baldy man now seemed unable to watch any longer. He stood up and said: "Since that's the case, I'll authenticate it for you. Please everyone be witness. Brother who's exchanging money, let me see the note."

The peddler hesitated: "You're not trying to trick me, are you?"

"I'm a Great Song official. How could I trick you?" The fake-Baldy man had a righteously indignant expression.

Only then did the peddler take out the note.and hesitantly hand it over, adding: "Be careful—don't damage it."

The fake-Baldy cadre took the note, pulled a magnifying glass from his satchel, held up the bill against the light, and searched for something. Before long, a blurry crane appeared in the backlit paper. He immediately called out: "See that? This is the anti-counterfeiting mark on the new notes!"

After displaying it in a half-circle around the middle and rear of the boat, the medicine seller took the magnifying glass and note and displayed them in a half-circle at the front of the boat. Yuan Shuzhi saw that the paper note indeed had a crane watermark and was secretly shocked.

By this point in the "show," while others watched with fascination, Yuan Shuzhi had seen plenty of "shills" during his time among the lower classes. He knew this was a scam—both the obvious shills and the hidden ones. This was a common routine at places frequented by outside travelers like boats, docks, inns, and roadside tea stands. They specifically swindled passersby. Though the tricks and names varied, the routine was the same.

He knew this gang was committing crimes together and didn't know their relationship with the boat operator. It wasn't appropriate to make a fuss now—he just carefully observed, memorizing the facial features of each person for later investigation.

What truly shocked him wasn't the scam itself, but this counterfeit note before him. As a Guangzhou civil servant, he knew counterfeit currency circulated on the market—the bureau had specifically held meetings to announce this, including the types and characteristics of discovered counterfeits.

From the briefing materials, all discovered counterfeits were very crude—obviously fake at a glance. Except for swindling villagers in rather remote places, they'd be exposed at any decent-sized market.

But this note before him—the material, patterns, and lettering—all closely resembled genuine currency. The only difference was that the design and color differed from current notes.

But the note had only flashed before his eyes—Yuan Shuzhi had no time to examine it closely and couldn't get more details.

At this point, the peddler put on a pained and reluctant expression, unwillingly pulling out two silver dollars and handing them to the fool, saying heartbreakingly: "This is all the money I have—I've given up my savings! Take it all. Who knows if your note is real or fake. Exchanging one note for two dollars—you've made out like a bandit, brother!"

As the "landlord's fool son," of course he foolishly took whatever was given without objecting. Taking the money with a grin, he said: "One piece of paper can exchange for two silver cakes—you all call me a fool, but I think you're the fools!"

The fake-Baldy man put on a pained expression and continued advising the fool: "You can't spend money like this! You should go to a money shop or bank to exchange it for small change—you could get ten big one-yuan silver dollars! How'd you only get two! Sigh, sigh, sigh—young fellow, you didn't steal this money, did you?"

The fool hastily waved his hands: "I didn't steal it! I didn't steal it! I wouldn't dare! My brother gave me this for drinking." He made a silly drinking gesture.

The fake-Baldy man continued asking: "What does your brother do?"

The fool answered: "My brother collects money in the countryside with the Chiefs." Then he made an abacus-counting motion. "He has so much money he can't count it all—he gave me lots!" With that, he pulled out a stack of bills that all looked similar: "My brother gave me lots."

The peddler acted enlightened: "So your brother is an Elder's accountant—no wonder he can get big money!"

The medicine peddler said: "I want some too—I'll give you two silver coins for one note!"

After exchanging money, he slapped his thigh in apparent anguish: "Ah, I usually carry over a dozen yuan on me, but today I'd just bought goods and spent all my money! If I'd known, I'd have bought less medicine!" He kept shouting to everyone around the boat.

The peddler and medicine peddler sang in harmony, inciting everyone nearby to "cheat" the fool by exchanging one note for two dollars. After some manipulation, some passengers on the boat fell for it. Several well-dressed people, apparently from fairly wealthy merchant or gentry families, probably thought this was a heaven-sent opportunity to find a bargain and started pulling out money to exchange—one note, two notes... One merchant-looking fellow actually pulled out ten dollars at once and exchanged for five notes.

If anyone had less than two dollars, the two men would say they were cheating the fool and block him from accepting.

Two dollars was no small sum after all—most people couldn't produce that much money, and those who couldn't exchange showed envious expressions. The peddler then "offered advice," suggesting several people "pool together" to exchange for one note.

Since the note could be exchanged for ten dollars, they could simply exchange it afterward and divide by head. Everyone could calculate this easily. The boat cabin erupted in excitement, with several people pooling money to buy one note.

The fake-Baldy man put on an upright appearance of refusing to "cheat the fool," repeatedly advising him: "You could exchange this note for ten big silver dollars in the city! Why are you giving it to them! Sigh, sigh, sigh! Your brother will be heartbroken when he finds out!"

In this whole farce, over half the passengers had paid out money. Yuan Shuzhi roughly calculated—this one trip netted the gang over thirty dollars. Quite a profitable deal!

As the exchangers ran out, the fool got off at Tangxia. After two more docks, the medicine peddler and peddler also disembarked one after another.

As for the exchanged notes, everyone clutched them carefully to their chests, looking around warily, afraid of revealing their wealth and getting robbed. At another market town—a major dock—the boat stopped at around five in the afternoon for a break. Passengers wanting to go ashore for food and shopping could do as they pleased, but had to return before dark since the boat would continue sailing at night.

The moment the boat steadied, passengers scrambled ashore. Among them were quite a few wealthy folk who'd brought lots of provisions. The boatman puffed on his pipe with a cold smile at the corner of his mouth. Yuan Shuzhi knew he probably knew something, so he deliberately said: "How come so many people suddenly went ashore for a meal break?"

Before the boatman could speak, the boatwoman laughed: "They're not going for a meal break—they're going to Delong to exchange money, waiting to get rich!"

"Getting rich or not isn't our concern. Xiao Quan, get several bamboo tubes ready in case someone wants to jump in the river later."
