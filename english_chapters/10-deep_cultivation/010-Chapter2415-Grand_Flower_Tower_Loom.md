# Chapter 2415: Grand Flower Tower Loom

"Naturally, every family keeps their own seeds. How can such a life-and-death matter be handed over to others?" Chen Lin said. "If they hear of any good silkworm seeds with rich yields, they will also try to find them. However..."

"However what?" Li Yao'er said. "Is it that because they haven't seen anyone eat the fruit, no one is willing to eat it?"

"Chief speaks correctly. Back then, my late father introduced Huzhou silkworm seeds and offered them for people to raise for free, but no one was interested. So he planned to raise them himself as a demonstration first. Unexpectedly, he ended up raising the silkworms to death, and the credibility of the silkworm seeds was completely gone."

"Introducing silkworm seeds is easier said than done; there are many tricks inside." Li Yao'er remembered the past events of promoting silkworm seeds in Suzhou and Hangzhou and sighed with emotion. "This losing business is not something ordinary people can do."

"Yes, only the Senate can do it," Chen Lin flattered.

Li Yao'er was stunned, then smiled: "Unexpectedly, you are quite good at flattering."

Chen Lin was young after all, and his face turned red all at once.

"But you are right. Such a thing where one family loses money and everyone benefits is only suitable for the government to do—by the way, you call it the Court. Anyway, that's the meaning."

"The Court *Yamen* can't be bothered to do these things. Organizing the repair of water conservancy counts as meritorious virtue." Chen Lin said, "Small one has also experienced the New Life Movement in Guangzhou. The Chiefs' vision is indeed remarkable..."

Li Yao'er nodded thoughtfully. It seemed that Liu Xiang's administration in Guangzhou had indeed won people's hearts. As long as they were human, seeing the Senate's administration, they would be touched. Compared to when she was in Jiangnan, the work here would be much easier to do.

At that moment, Li Yao'er took him to visit the newly renovated factory. If the first courtyard only had slight changes, the changes in the second courtyard were earth-shaking.

The second courtyard was originally the main body of the weaving workshop. Except for the main hall used for office work, the rest of the houses were all used as machine rooms. The houses here were very different from ordinary civilian residences; they were all high-roofed open pavilions. Whether the main house or the wing rooms, the roof frames were extremely high, approaching a height of two *zhang* (approx. 6.6 meters). Even in the affluent Pearl River Delta, such houses were rare.

Compared to the nearly luxurious roof frames of the houses, the walls appeared shabby. The outer walls were not brick masonry, nor even mud bricks, but used bamboo strips as frames and reeds as walls, looking very simple. Because they were destroyed by chaotic soldiers in the previous stage, most of these reed mat walls were damaged, and many places could be seen to be new.

"...When I first arrived at the factory and saw your equipment and factory buildings, I was startled. To tell the truth, it was the first time I saw such high factory buildings," Li Yao'er said.

Inside the main house, four Flower Looms were arranged, all wooden structures. They were veritable behemoths. Two loom workers, one weaving and one perched high on the Flower Tower lifting patterns, cooperated tacitly, weaving satin.

"Building so high was also out of necessity. When the Flower Looms were transported and installed back then, according to logic, two-foot pits should be dug to place the *Qu Jiao* (Harness Legs). The local ground is low and wet; water comes out less than a foot down. My late father said since it was so, just build the house higher. It's also better for ventilation and dispersing dampness. The weavers also work cooler in summer."

Li Yao'er nodded: "Your father was a kind-hearted person." She was a person who had seen the production environment of weaving households and weavers with her own eyes. Whether home weaving or the Weaving Bureaus of Suzhou and Hangzhou, ordinary houses were used as workshops. Some houses were low and small and couldn't contain the Flower Loom and Flower Tower, so deep pits of several feet were dug in the ground, and weavers could only sit in the pits to weave.

Because silk weaving required air to maintain a certain humidity to reduce broken threads, the workshops were not specially ventilated. When the air was dry, water had to be splashed into the room to maintain moisture. Therefore, it was sultry and humid in summer and wet and cold in winter. Weavers often had joint diseases.

The reeling workshop in the Villa seemed "inhumane" to Li Yao'er, but honestly speaking, after seeing the weavers' workshops in Suzhou and Hangzhou, she knew Zhao Yingong counted as a "conscientious capitalist."

"But if you ventilate and scatter dampness, wouldn't your silk threads break easily here?" Li Yao'er asked.

It was still winter now, and the problem of ventilation was not so urgent. And the workshop was only in trial production. The scale was not large. Waiting until this year's spring cocoons came onto the market and entering summer would be the time for formal start of work.

"Our place was originally a river beach, and water appears when digging the ground. Even with ventilation, it is still very wet." Chen Lin had gradually shed his fear of Australians at this moment, feeling much more relaxed, just like when discussing matters in the workshop with his father, third uncle, and others back then. His words and actions also became somewhat casual.

"So running textiles in Guangdong has this benefit!" Li Yao'er smiled. She walked to an empty Grand Flower Tower Loom. Although she had seen replicas in the old timeline, and seen similar machines in Suzhou, Hangzhou, and other places in this timeline, every time she saw this completely wooden machine, she still felt very shocked.

A Grand Flower Tower Loom could be said to be a giant in traditional textile equipment. The total length was close to six meters, and the height of the Flower Tower was also close to three meters. There were nearly two thousand large and small parts on it. When it started operating, the whole machine was like being covered by a spider web, connected into a whole by ropes, warp threads, and weft threads, moving back and forth with the rise and fall of the weaver's hands and feet. Weaving silk fabrics bit by bit. When Li Yao'er saw the replica machine performance back then, she was completely won over: in the era of pure manual work, without precision processing equipment, using the simplest and most primitive materials, and a very simple structure—without a single gear—it could weave silk fabrics with various patterns and textures. This was simply a miracle in handicraft industry.

The history of the Flower Tower Loom was very long. Jacquard looms had appeared as early as the Three Kingdoms period, and the Grand Flower Tower Loom that made Li Yao'er marvel had actually appeared in the Song Dynasty. Judging from historical documents and paintings, the Grand Flower Tower Loom of the Ming Dynasty was basically similar to that of the Song Dynasty. Only in jacquard technology, it improved from bamboo woven flower books to thread woven flower books.

"This machine is really beautiful," Li Yao'er said. "But I still don't quite understand. Can you introduce it to me?"

She had asked about the details of this Flower Loom long ago, but Chen Xuan didn't understand, and the weavers could only demonstrate doing the work, but couldn't explain the tricks inside—the weavers only spoke local dialect, and Li Yao'er lacked even Cantonese, let alone understanding the Xiangshan dialect.

"This Flower Loom is the most valuable thing in the weaving workshop." Chen Lin stroked the wood of the Flower Loom—years of use had created a layer of patina-like covering on the surface of the wood, smooth and delicate to the touch. This machine was purchased by his grandfather back then. It was the oldest one among the four Flower Looms.

"This raised part is the Flower Tower. When weaving patterned satin, one person is responsible for controlling the rise and fall of warp threads on the Flower Tower, called the Flower Puller (Draw Boy). The one dragging in the middle is called the *Qu Pan* (Harness Board), used to adjust the opening position of the warp threads. The rows of bamboo sticks hanging below are called *Qu Jiao* (Harness Legs). There are a total of eighteen hundred."

"So many?"

"Just that many," Chen Lin said. "Although they may not all be used during weaving, they must be used when weaving satin with complex patterns."

"How is it specifically woven?"

Li Yao'er had stood by the weaver and watched carefully for a long time at the operation of the jacquard loom, but still didn't understand how these two weavers turned countless silk threads into various brocades with rich colors and gorgeous patterns while chanting rhythmically like singing and throwing hands and feet.

Chen Lin grew up in the weaving workshop. Not only was he influenced by what he saw and heard, but he had also operated on the machine himself. He was, if not familiar, at least clear about the entire process.

"Chief, please look." He pointed to a circle of white recycling device with tassel style at the top of the Flower Tower Loom currently in weaving. This device moved forward continuously and rotated cyclically with the operation of the loom, similar to a conveyor belt.

"This thing is called the Flower Book (Pattern Book). What kind of satin is woven depends entirely on this Flower Book to control."

Whatever the Flower Book was, it was woven with bamboo first, and changed to thread-woven Flower Books in the Song Dynasty.

The Flower Book was equivalent to the template of the jacquard loom. The satin produced was controlled entirely by the Flower Book for its pattern. After a new pattern was designed, it was first woven with thread by the weaver according to the pattern draft, and at the same time matched with relevant mnemonics.

The Flower Book was woven from *Jiao Zi Xian* (Footer Threads/Lashes) representing warp threads and *Er Zi Xian* (Ear Threads/Simples) representing weft threads. Looking at the Flower Book alone, one couldn't see the specific pattern.

When starting to weave, the weaver first connected the *Jiao Zi Xian* on the Flower Book with the fiber threads lifting the warp threads. The Flower Puller sitting on the Flower Tower raised in the middle of the loom pulled the *Jiao Zi Xian*—that is, the *Qu Xian*—up and down according to the "mnemonics" compiled in the Flower Book, thereby controlling the lifting of the corresponding warp threads. The positioning of pulling the *Jiao Zi Xian* was determined by the position of the *Er Zi Xian* on the Flower Book.

The weaver sitting below the loom, after the Flower Puller finished lifting the pattern, first had to step on the bamboo or wooden treadle rods to control the lifting and lowering of the heddle frames connected to them, causing the "warp surface" formed by warp threads to separate up and down, forming a shuttle mouth (shed). Next, the weaver held the shuttle containing the weft thread to perform "throwing shuttle and leading weft." After the warp and weft threads were interwoven, the "reed" was used to beat the newly woven weft thread solid. Such a process completed the weaving of one weft thread. The weaver realized the weaving of the entire pattern by constantly changing the stepping of the treadle rods to realize the alternating up and down change of warp threads.

Naturally, the more complex the pattern and the longer the pattern cycle, the more frequent and complex the Flower Puller's operation would be. For the K'o-ssu (Cut Silk) Dragon Robe material with the most complex weaving in the Ming and Qing dynasties, a weaver could only weave a few meters a day.

"Truly remarkable," Li Yao'er praised sincerely.

"When this small one saw weavers weaving back then, I also felt it was very magical. The person who thought of this Flower Book was truly amazing!" Chen Lin said, "Only with this Grand Flower Tower Loom can large flower patterns be woven. It is said that the Dragon Robe materials woven for the Emperor by the Suzhou and Hangzhou Manufacturing Bureaus are made this way."

Li Yao'er thought the concept of this Flower Book was already very advanced. The Flower Book not only simplified the weaving process but also reduced the technical requirements for weavers. As long as there was a Flower Book, weavers could stably repeat production of products with almost consistent patterns and texture.

It was a pity that this equipment had almost no improvement from the Song Dynasty to the late Qing Dynasty. The Flower Tower Loom of 1880 had no great difference from the Flower Tower Loom of 1000.
