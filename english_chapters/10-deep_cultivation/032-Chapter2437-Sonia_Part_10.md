# Chapter 2437: Sonia (X)

"Let's start by repairing this marlin specimen," Sonia said. She decided to start with this fish. Relatively speaking, this marlin's repair was simplest—not only saving time but also giving apprentices hands-on practice.

The apprentices gathered around—as future Remote Survey Team and Natural History Museum staff, learning how to make and repair specimens was basic professional training.

The marlin specimen's main problem was skin cracking. This was actually caused by excessive drying of the leather. So the first task was restoring the skin's elasticity.

Sonia first used a duster to dust off the accumulated ash from the specimen, then had her two apprentices carefully brush away surface dust and grime with fine-bristle brushes.

"Leave alone the dirt that can't be brushed off for now," Sonia said. "Later when we do the surface softening treatment, we can use water to remove it."

After removing the dust, Sonia had the apprentices bring clean cloth strips. After soaking them thoroughly in water, they wrapped up the entire specimen. This step was to let the specimen's skin absorb moisture, softening it and restoring some of the skin's tension.

How long this step needed depended entirely on the specimen restorer's personal experience. Sonia had some experience repairing fish skin taxidermy specimens. She set a timer on the specimen room's alarm clock.

"The skin still needs some time to absorb moisture. Using this time, let's first complete some procedures for a new specimen." She gestured to Dawen: "Bring collection specimen 171."

The specimen she was preparing to make was a bird specimen recently collected from the Taiwan expedition: the Taiwan blue magpie.

Sonia first displayed a natural history illustration of the Taiwan blue magpie on the easel:

"This was collected in the mountains of the Taitung Longitudinal Valley. It's a bird species endemic to Taiwan Island. Latin scientific name *Urocissa caerulea*. Belongs to Neornithes subclass, Corvidae family, *Urocissa* genus, Taiwan blue magpie species. Everyone can come closer to look—the picture is rather small."

Everyone gathered closer. Sonia continued:

"In this natural history illustration, everyone can clearly see: the Taiwan blue magpie's head, face, neck, throat, and chest are all black. Yellow irises surround black pupils. Bright red beak and legs. The visible upper body and lower abdomen are bright blue. It has twelve tail feathers. The two longest have blue bases with white tips; the rest have black bases with white tips, symmetrical left and right. The lower abdomen and undertail coverts are grayish white. Its tail feathers are particularly long, accounting for two-thirds of total body length."

"Like all corvid birds, the Taiwan blue magpie has a noisy personality with coarse and clamorous calls. When flying, they generally proceed in straight lines, often active in pairs or small groups. They're widely distributed on Taiwan Island, with specimens collected at multiple locations. They generally move in lower mountain forests; rarely seen in plains."

Sonia spoke eloquently, like an experienced university professor. Actually, she had never taught classes before. She had mentored one apprentice, but informally—after all, she was too young. Openly taking apprentices would inevitably give her guild colleagues an impression of "arrogance." After arriving in Lingao, influenced and encouraged by Lin Hanlong, she gradually began teaching professional knowledge to others. Especially after she could fairly well master Chinese, most of her spare time was spent either taking classes or giving classes. Teaching experience had also accumulated.

"This blue magpie is really beautiful!" A girl interjected.

"Indeed, the blue magpie's appearance is certainly beautiful. Like corvid birds, it's rather intelligent. It can be domesticated as an ornamental bird—only its call is too unpleasant."

"Then why doesn't our museum raise a few live ones? More lifelike than looking at specimens or pictures."

"And no need to repair specimens..."

The apprentices, mostly female, once they started chattering there was no end.

"Raising live animals is the zoo's business—we're not a zoo," Sonia said. "Perhaps a zoo will be established in Lingao in the future." She pulled the topic back. "According to observations from several expeditions: they have fierce personalities and like to gather in groups, often active in small flocks. When flying, they line up in a row. Flocked Taiwan blue magpies stay together year-round, are strongly territorial, and will drive away invading birds of other species."

While speaking, Dawen had brought over the collection specimen.

This Taiwan blue magpie was placed in a large lidded enamel shallow basin. Sonia put on gloves and carefully moved the collected body from the dish to the tile specimen preparation table.

"Everyone can first observe the Taiwan blue magpie's physical characteristics, then compare with other *Urocissa* genus birds. Xiaowen..."

Xiaowen immediately displayed natural history illustrations of the other five blue magpie species—this was what Sonia had prepared in advance for today's specimen class.

"Before making the specimen, we first measure its dimensions. The measurement standards for various bird parts are as follows: body length is measured from beak tip to tail end; culmen length is the straight-line distance from where feathers grow at beak base to upper mandible tip; wing length is distance from wrist to longest flight feather tip; tail length is straight-line distance from tail feather base to longest tail feather tip; tarsus length is from the midpoint at the back of the tibiotarsal joint to the lower edge of the lowest complete scale at the front of the tarsometatarsal-middle-toe joint."

She opened a tape measure and measured the specimen's lengths in sequence: body length 64.5 centimeters, wingspan 20.3 centimeters, tail length 39.7 centimeters...

Following her dictated numbers, Xiaowen began recording the production log.

"Before we start making, we first need to do preparatory work—first, protective measures," Sonia said. "All birds and beasts carry parasites, bacteria, and viruses, some of which are zoonotic. So we wear these white lab coats, gloves, masks, and other protective equipment. Please everyone check your protective situation again."

Rustling sounds came from the room. Then quiet returned.

"This time we're making a bird specimen. Before this, the collection specimen has gone through 72 hours of low-temperature refrigeration and 24 hours of insecticide solution soaking, fully killing attached bacteria and parasites."

Speaking, she spread out the blue magpie on the preparation table.

"Now, we begin the first step: separating skin from flesh. Please pay close attention."

Sonia placed the sterilized and de-insected bird belly-up on the worktable, parted the chest to abdomen feathers to both sides, then raised a sharp scalpel and cut decisively at the blue magpie's chest, cutting along the midline all the way to the abdomen, forming a shallow surface opening.

"Note when cutting to be careful about depth—can't cut too deep to prevent directly opening the abdomen. Otherwise, abdominal cavity contents will leak, contaminating skin and feathers. Depth should roughly be just opening the epidermis. Length is to about one to two centimeters from the anus."

She used tweezers to lift the epidermis layer, held the skin layer with tweezers, and bit by bit pulled apart flesh from skin and fur.

"...When skinning, technique must be gentle. When skinning bird pelts, be especially careful. Its appearance features are mainly the feathers, so absolutely cannot damage feathers while skinning."

As the separation progressed, the bird's blood began flowing out, and there were excretions from the anus. Dawen used absorbent paper to wipe at the side throughout.

"Pay special attention to keeping things clean, preventing feather contamination that affects appearance."

Sonia's fingers were agile and strong, movements steady and fast, looking very effortless. Where joints or adhesions were tight, she picked up the scalpel and separated while cutting.

She started from the chest and abdomen, separating toward head and tail respectively. When reaching the shoulders, she first separated the wing-root skin and fur, used scissors to cut away wing-root muscles, cut the joint, then continued separating toward the wing tip until there was no more muscle tissue, using scissors to cut bone and muscle together. When reaching the legs, she first separated the leg-root skin and fur, used scissors to cut muscles and joints, then continued separating toward the front of the leg until there was no more muscle tissue, using scissors to cut bone and muscle together.

When reaching near the tail, she temporarily stopped, using absorbent paper to clean blood and fat between subcutaneous tissue and muscle. Here she had to be careful—couldn't strip all the way to the bottom, otherwise it was easy to damage the tail and cloaca, risking tail feather loss and excrement and fat seepage.

So she only stripped to near the tail root, leaving some muscle tissue. She then turned to stripping the upper skin. Stripping head skin was a difficulty point. She worked more carefully until the entire head skin and fur was stripped off, leaving only the tiniest bit where the beak connected. Then she picked up scissors and cleanly cut right at the beak's base.

Thus, a complete Taiwan blue magpie bird skin was completely stripped off, spread flat on the preparation table.

The apprentices watched very attentively. At every key point, they would involuntarily hold their breath. At such moments, the entire preparation room was silent as a grave. When things were successfully resolved, everyone would involuntarily breathe out together.

Sonia picked up the scalpel, cleanly cut off the now fully skinned bird head, and placed it in a small porcelain bowl at the side.

"If conditions permit, the skull can be retained. This way, when making the specimen, the head has a basic support with better restoration. But proper preservation treatment must be done." Speaking, she used the scalpel to remove brain tissue, eyes, tongue, and muscle from the bird skull.

"Take this to boil and remove flesh from bone," she instructed Dawen. Then picking up the pelt, she said: "After the pelt is stripped, the second step is washing. Washing uses soapberry powder mixed with clean water. That's all." She immersed the pelt in the enamel basin and gently rubbed and washed.

"When washing, both inside and outside must be clean. Also inspect the skin layer—if there's still residual muscle tissue, continue removing. Be careful not to use too much force, to prevent feathers from falling off."

After washing, Sonia hung the blue magpie's pelt on a special rack placed in a shaded area to naturally drip-dry.

Stripped pelts easily lost moisture and hardened, affecting later production. So they couldn't be left too long—generally, stripping was done in the morning, and after washing and drying until afternoon, stuffing proceeded. It was already past 4 PM now—today she'd have to work overtime again.
