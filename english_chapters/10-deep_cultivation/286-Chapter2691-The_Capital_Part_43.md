# Chapter 2691: The Capital (Part 43)

Zhou Lezhi absolutely agreed with this point, because the Teacher was basically being played in the palm of Master Wang's hand up to now. Master Wang knew every move of his; even what he said to the two concubines last night and how they did the deed, as long as Master Wang wanted to know, he could know.

Don't look at the Teacher being full of learning; when discussing the ability to be an official, let alone not having one percent of Master Wang, even he, Zhou Lezhi, probably was several times stronger than him.

But the Teacher wasn't a "bookworm" who only knew how to read books either. When discussing human feelings and worldly wisdom, he was sometimes also very shrewd. From this view, the Teacher was just aloof and arrogant, unwilling to throw himself into the mud and filthy water.

Thinking of this, his admiration for the Teacher increased by a few points. He suddenly remembered something and asked again:

"Isn't the Teacher an Australian? Haven't you thought about going back to Australia?"

"I, can't go back." Seeing the disciple mention this, Hearthstone Immortal looked up at the sky and sighed long.

"Aren't they right in Lingao?" These words had somewhat of a probing component, which was also what Master Wang instructed him to figure out: Would this Hearthstone Immortal go to defect to the Shorn-hair Thieves in Lingao?

"Lingao is indeed Australian. Speaking of which, they are also my fellow townsmen. It's just the situation is unclear; I dare not go rashly." The Teacher sighed.

It seemed the Teacher's idea of defecting to Lingao hadn't changed, but his attitude was hesitant.

"Wait until Master Wang takes office in Guangzhou; we can also go to Guangzhou. At that time, we can just look at the situation again." Zhou Lezhi persuaded. These words were half true and half false. From his true heart, he naturally didn't wish for the Teacher to defect to the Australians and go without return; but if he dissuaded him, the Teacher would most likely become suspicious.

If he became guarded against himself, these supreme learnings couldn't be learned anymore.

Although the servants of the Wang family laughed at Mr. Zhou's learning as "Wild Fox Zen" [unorthodox/heretical] and at most miscellaneous studies with no use, Zhou Lezhi knew that the Teacher's learning was just learned without place to use.

"Can only be so. Fortunately, arriving in Guangzhou, it's not far from Hainan Island either. Right, there is also *Zizhenzhai*—don't know if that surnamed Guo will come back."

"For a gold-melting cave like Guangzhou, how could he not come back? If his playthings are not sold to big households, could they be sold to the mud-legs [peasants] of Qiongzhou Prefecture?"

Hearthstone Immortal froze, laughing: "Correct, correct, you speak rightly. This bunch of Australians made so many things; there must be a market for them."

The days in Dongyang were not counted as long, but they were the days Zhou Lezhi lived most happily. Everyday he either followed the Teacher circling in the mountains, studying mountains, rivers, geography, plants, and minerals; or knocking and beating in the farm, engaging in some project. Everyday he could learn brand new knowledge, opening up new worlds one by one.

In front of the Teacher's ocean of knowledge, he himself was truly too ignorant. Not only himself, but everyone he had seen, including Master Wang who could pass the Jinshi exam, was also so.

Zhou Lezhi experienced the joy of learning for the first time. He began to learn for the sake of knowledge, not for "useful," "can make a living," or "House of Gold and Face like Jade."

The manager of the Dongyang farm had already received notification: as long as he didn't tear down the sky, let the Teacher toss about as he pleased. When the Immortal tossed all the money away, naturally he would be at peace.

Hearthstone Immortal also didn't let down his title of Immortal. The mosquito incense produced hit the market exactly in summer when mosquitoes and insects bred. Because the effect was good, price cheap, and without choking smoke, it soon became a hot commodity in the market and was sold out very quickly. Although the money earned wasn't much, it was enough to make everyone up and down the farm look at this "Immortal" with new eyes.

Zhou Lezhi also studied for more than half a year in such a "work-study" environment. Shortly after celebrating the New Year in Dongyang, a letter came from Guangzhou, and the master and disciple group embarked on the journey to Guangzhou again.

At the beginning of Wang Yehao's term in Guangzhou, what he took over was a mess: although the main profession of the Governor-General was military affairs, the Governor-General of Liangguang also concurrently held the post of Governor of Guangdong. Moreover, by coincidence, the Governor-General's office was originally in Zhaoqing, but in these few years, it happened to have moved to Guangzhou.

In this way, many administrative difficulties of Guangdong fell upon his head as a matter of course.

Not to mention the treasury was empty as if washed, he also inexplicably owed huge debts. The Prefect of Guangzhou came to cry and complain every day, saying subordinate counties were all looted by Shorn-hair Thieves, asking the Lord to memorialize the Court to reduce and exempt taxes.

As for the compensation for soldiers and generals who died in several defeats, the reorganization of troops withdrawn from Qiongzhou, the repair of burned courier stations and houses, the reconstruction of various forts at the Pearl River Estuary; various Yao settlements being unstable... these were even more like snowflakes, sprinkling onto Master Wang's head.

After several months back and forth, Wang Yehao finally sorted things out roughly. Only then did he know there were also Ransom Fees and a "Peace Treaty" concluded privately.

Ransom Fees were one thing; anyway, previous arrangements were proper. As long as no accidents happened, he could balance the accounts during his term without causing any trouble. But this "Peace Treaty" was troublesome.

He summoned Jin Wenchi to study this treaty and see what hidden dangers there were.

"Master, although this treaty is a scourge, it does not hinder the Master." Jin Wenchi said after reading, "This treaty was not signed in the Master's hand; the Master naturally doesn't know..."

"This I naturally understand, but the conditions inside..."

"Master just pretend not to know. Put plainly, these conditions are all Guangzhou Prefecture's matters; Master just open one eye and close one eye—as long as not provoking the Shorn-hair Thieves, presumably they won't come to cause trouble either." Jin Wenchi said, "As for the various Great Gods in Guangzhou City, whose butt is clean? With Vicery Wang as a warning example, who is still willing to go provoke Shorn-hair Thieves?"

Wang Yehao agreed deeply. Before coming to Guangzhou, he had already grasped a lot of information. After coming to Guangzhou, for the rehabilitation matters, he met many involved parties again.

Shorn-hair Thieves were very different from ordinary sea bandits; absolutely not kind types. However, he also roughly knew Shorn-hair Thieves valued credit most. As long as he didn't seek death himself and acted according to the treaty, there was a high probability of not provoking them.

But Shorn-hair Thieves had become a major hidden danger to the Imperial Court; on this point, he understood better than anyone.

"Bring Hearthstone Immortal here! Be quick!"

As an "Australian," Hearthstone Immortal presumably knew much about the inside information of the Shorn-hair Thieves. Considering the Shorn-hair Thieves must have placed countless eyes and ears inside Guangzhou City, and the officials and clerks in various yamens who took their benefits were also countless, such a person whose speech and behavior were outstanding couldn't be arranged in Guangzhou City. After thinking again and again, he arranged Hearthstone Immortal in the Governor-General's Office in Zhaoqing—the house was big enough for him to toss about however he wanted.

Since the success of the mosquito incense business, Wang Yehao's view of Hearthstone Immortal had gone up another level. Everyone liked making money. If he could help scheme for him in Zhaoqing while tossing out a second mosquito incense, wouldn't it be wonderful? He had already instructed the manager in Dongyang to produce more, rushing to transport to Guangzhou before spring entered next year—the weather here was hotter, and mosquitoes and insects appeared very early.

Zhaoqing used to be the seat of the Governor-General's Office. Now there were still some subordinate officials of the Governor-General's Yamen and many troops stationed there; defense and control were very convenient. Zhaoqing went deep into the interior, detached from Guangzhou's influence, yet had the West River water route connecting; travel between the two places was convenient. Placing this special staff team here, Wang Yehao was very reassured.

Except for Jin Wenchi and a few confidant advisors brought from the capital, the advisors around Wang Yehao didn't know there was such a colleague existing in Zhaoqing.

"Just this gun?" Mr. Zhou looked at the "Shorn-hair Thief Divine Artifact" placed on the desk, a look of disappointment appearing on his face.

"What does the Teacher think of this object?" Wang Yehao heard Zhou Lezhi's tone seeming very disdainful and was secretly surprised.

"Just like this I guess. Looks like it can't even fire continuously; have to reload after shooting one shot." Although somewhat disappointed, Mr. Zhou was also very surprised to see this thing.

"According to the Teacher's meaning, there are firearms above this?" Wang Yehao's eyes shone.

"That is natural. In the Qiankun Mirror, awesome guys are many; these can't even count as entry-level, right." Mr. Zhou played with it carefully for a while and asked, "Right, where was this gun got from?"

Liu Sha glanced sideways, seeing Wang Yehao nodding slightly, then retold the situation again: "Speaking of which, it is also a coincidence. The lowly one originally had a familiar brother in the capital called Huang Laoliu. Because the Court abolished the Guard and Depots [secret police], he lost his rice bowl, so he drifted to Guangzhou and got on a boat to do some water-touching business. This bird gun was obtained from the boat owner's fence [receiver of stolen goods]."

Liu Sha's mouthful of black talk made Mr. Zhou frown repeatedly: "Speak human language!"

"It means there was a group of Good Fellows [bandits/heroes] who set an ambush and robbed a Shorn-hair Thief boat; this bird gun was snatched from the Shorn-hair Thieves' hands."

"Real or fake? What Good Fellows are so fierce?" Mr. Zhou was extremely astonished. "Speaking of which, the Court sent tens of thousands of troops and horses before; how come they are not as forceful as mountain bandits?"

"Uh, fear it was Regional Commander He underestimating the enemy. However, Shorn-hair Thief firearms are indeed formidable; it is said during the camp raid this bird gun harmed quite a few Good Fellows' lives."

Zhou Lezhi thought for a moment, feeling it was still necessary to seek first-hand materials from the involved party: "Master Liu, where is that Huang Laoliu? I want to find him to ask."

"The lowly one arranged for Brother Huang to stare in Guangzhou." Liu Sha answered, "If Sir has any doubts, the lowly one will send a message over."

"Let him come over; I want to ask about the detailed situation. Also, is it true that those Australians burn, kill, loot, and do all evils?" Mr. Zhou asked the confusion buried in his heart for a long time.

"Could there be fake! Shorn-hair Thieves rely on sharp firearms to do all conscience-losing dirty deals. Where the soldier's edge reaches, care not if you are gentry young master or old, weak, women, and children; whoever disobeys is all slaughtered village and exterminated clan. Several villages outside Guangzhou City were all made extinct [residents killed]. The lowly one almost couldn't escape back."

"How can it be like this! Even old, weak, women, and children are not spared?!" Mr. Zhou was still somewhat daring not to believe.

"That gang of Shorn-hair Thieves has a sadistic nature. Every time they kill into a village, they find an empty field to set up a high platform as a place of execution, hanging people to death then letting them air-dry without allowing corpse collection, even calling it beautifully 'Hanging Lamps'..." Liu Sha added oil and vinegar to retell the stories of Shorn-hair Thieves robbing village by village, besieging cities and setting fires, and extorting ransoms.

Zhou Lezhi listened on the side with secret palpitations, involuntarily worrying about his own family's safety—speaking of which, ever since going to Dongyang, there had been no letter correspondence for a long time. Thinking of this, his heart burned with anxiety involuntarily, wanting to ask for leave to go back and look.
