# Chapter 2626: Li Family Enclosure

Zhu Shilian and Mao Yuanyi came to the workshop. This was a spacious brick and tile building, divided into several parts such as Nitre Refining, Sulfur Refining, and Medicine Mixing.

"The nitre quality of this pot is slightly inferior; need to add five more egg whites." In the Nitre Refining Workshop, the young man lecturing Zhu clan children was named Mao Shiba. He was a servant boy born in Mao Yuanyi's family, guided by Mao Yuanyi since childhood, and was very skilled in gunpowder production.

Other operators poured rough nitre into an iron pot, spreading half a pot flat, then poured in egg whites and rubbed evenly with hands, then slowly added water. The water used must be spring water, river water, pond water, or sweet well water. After transferring to another pot, boil with high fire, stirring constantly. Impurities and foam on the surface were skimmed off with a dense bamboo basket. Stir again and boil again, adding plant ash water. Finally, use a grass stick to take a little nitre water and drop it on the fingernail, judging whether the fire duration (*Huo Hou*) arrived by observing the shape of the water bead.

The boiled nitre water was filtered through two layers of grass linen into a large glazed magnetic vat. Within three to five days, "Nitre Teeth" (*Xiao Ya*) would form. After Nitre Teeth were taken out, they were dried in the shade under trees and ground fine, sifted through a fine silk sieve for later use. The mother liquor after nitre extraction would not be discarded; it still contained nitre and could be extracted once more.

Production tools and equipment in the Medicine Mixing Workshop were all made of wood, stone, or copper. Iron tools were strictly prohibited, mainly to avoid generating sparks and causing accidents. Fire was strictly prohibited indoors, so operations were all done during the day. But at the moment, the Medicine Mixing Workshop was not mixing medicine, but only grinding and processing the three main raw materials, storing them separately, also to avoid accidents before use.

Ming Dynasty gunpowder formulas varied according to different uses, roughly divided into propellant, explosive, signal medicine, etc. Propellant was further divided into rocket medicine, gun medicine, cannon medicine, etc. Explosive was divided into hand cannon medicine, landmine medicine, naval mine medicine, etc. Ratios were all different. The Bureau of Armaments (*Junqi Ju*) and Bureau of Weaponry (*Bingzhang Ju*) formulated ratio standards and issued them to various arsenals for execution, belonging to military secrets, never disclosed to the outside. Therefore, ratio data listed in various private military books could be used for reference, but were not necessarily true. Besides differences in ingredient ratios, gunpowder for different uses also had different particle sizes and densities, quite complex. Without the guidance of professionals well-versed in this way, what private individuals made might just set off fireworks.

To test the performance of gunpowder, Mao Yuanyi arranged to mix a small amount of finished product. To avoid combustion and explosion, raw materials needed to be moistened with wine first, then ground fine into mud, pounded ten thousand times, and mixed into granules the size of kidney beans.

Mao Yuanyi took a small amount of finished product from the medicine groove and placed it in his palm, walked outdoors, and explained to Zhu Shilian: "Gunpowder must be burned in the palm; it is acceptable only if heat is not felt. If feeling burning hot, pound again and test again as the previous method. regarding this I have four lines of formulas, saying: 'Mixing medicine doesn't dislike refinement, grinding medicine doesn't dislike fineness, pounding doesn't dislike much, building emptiness is most taboo.' If medicine can be refined, less counts as more. Excess and deficiency both lose their regulation; using it moderately means harmonizing peace."

After speaking, the medicine granules burned rapidly with a "boom" in Mao Yuanyi's hand and disappeared, leaving only a wisp of green smoke.

Zhu Shilian praised: "Brother Shimin has great talent; the power of this medicine does not lose to the thief bandits."

Mao Yuanyi reminded again: "Gunpowder is originally prepared to harm thieves. If stored improperly, occasionally causing self-injury, the harm is greater. If there is no good method for storage, tragedies like the repeated changes of Wanggong Factory, Helmet and Armor Factory, and Anmin Factory in the capital are all lessons from the past. The system of medicine storage mainly focuses on avoiding fire. It cannot be in the same bureau as medicine making, cannot be close to densely populated places, and even more cannot be hidden deep in pits. Our action this time is confidential. It is appropriate to store gunpowder using the Western method. Do not mix all of them, but refine and grind various materials clean, store separately waiting for temporary use. Use connected mortars to gather people to pound together; it can be done on the same day, no worry of being too late."

After inspecting the gunpowder manufacturing site, Zhu Shilian returned to the Zhu residence. Zhu Bolian was already seated in the main hall. Zhu Zhonglian, Zhu Shulian, Zhu Jilian, Zhu Huilian, and other main members of the Zhu clan were all gathered here.

Zhu Bolian said worriedly: "Disaster is coming! previously thief bandits controlled the countryside loosely, so we could achieve such a situation. Observing the actions of the bogus Magistrate, it seems there is an intention to build a city in this township. I privately think matters are bad. If what the clan does is known by thief bandits, the clan will be exterminated. Brothers quickly transfer gunpowder workshops and instruments; absolutely do not beat the grass to scare the snake."

Zhu Huilian said: "Big Brother, what is the intention of the bogus Magistrate's trip?"

Zhu Bolian said: "Building schools, Fish Flower factories, Silkworm Seed factories, Mulberry Seedling factories."

"What?" Everyone felt inconceivable. Building schools they could understand, but what things were Fish Flower factories, Silkworm Seed factories, and Mulberry Seedling factories?

Zhu Bolian recounted what he saw and heard in detail. Everyone listened dumbfounded. But given the style of thief bandits spread outside, they had to believe. If so many industries were to be built, then a solid city would appear on Jiujiang territory before long. This would be a major bad thing.

Quiet river water meandered past Li Family Enclosure (*Li Jia Wei*). Since thief bandits occupied Guangzhou Prefecture, boats sailing on the river became fewer. Not long after, thief bandits occupied Zhaoqing again. Rumors rose in the village that thief bandits were going to fight into Beijing to sit in the Dragon Court.

The old men in the village laughed it off. A few years ago when thief bandit warships rushed into the Pearl River Estuary and burned Wuyang Post Station, such words circulated in the village. The Great Excellency in the county also ordered villages to build regiments and recruit braves. For a time, the atmosphere in various villages was very tense. Especially after the village's regiment braves went out to reinforce and fought a big defeat, it was even more jittery (*Feng Sheng He Li* - wind sound crane cry).

Fortunately, news came not long after: thief bandits withdrew troops. Old men all said since ancient times, changing dynasties was getting the world on horseback; how could there be getting the world sitting on boats.

Since thief bandits withdrew troops, rumors also ended up with nothing. Unexpectedly, two years ago thief bandits suddenly occupied Guangzhou Prefecture City, didn't engage in looting but divided troops to attack cities and capture lands everywhere. Wherever they went, officials and defending troops everywhere either surrendered or fled. Not long after, thief bandits actually came out, now changing name to Great Song to sit in the world.

How thief bandits became "Great Song," nobody in the village could figure out. But thief bandits were Australians; regarding this everyone still knew. After all, Australian goods were easy to use. Whether matches, kerosene lamps, or "Australian Paper," people in the village used them.

Whether thief bandits, Australians, or "Great Song," originally they were just a group of "merchants" sitting on big ships to do business. In the eyes of common people, they meant about the same as Red Hairs and Franks, just looking different. Occupying Two Guangs in less than a few years, openly raising the big flag to be emperors—this more or less made people's brains unable to turn the corner. Thus not long after, various stories of thief bandits releasing demon magic to capture human souls spread out. Li Family Enclosure was also in a state of anxiety. People going to markets to attend fairs always brought back many rumors. There were those saying good words about Australians, and also those saying thief bandits were all man-eating demons. Because the contrast was truly too big, common people had no way to adapt.

As Australian rule deepened in Guangdong, gradually common people also adapted to the new rulers. Generally speaking, they didn't disturb the villagers' inherent lives. The Magistrate changed person; "Police" were sent to markets; fighting lawsuits in the county was no longer going to the county yamen, but on fixed days every month a "Circuit Court" came to open session. Besides this, everything remained as old. Whether common people or gentry, at least on the surface, they still lived their own good or bad days according to old habits.

But changes also came gradually. Since finishing autumn tax collection last year, many Australian "Cadres" suddenly came from the county. Mostly very young "children," each slinging a cloth bag, wearing a hat, holding tape measures and three-legged wooden things in the countryside, noisily measuring. Behind followed old "Household Clerks" originally retained by the county, holding "Fish Scale Books." Oh right, now not called "Fish Scale Books," called "Agricultural Real Estate Register." There were also some people setting up drawing boards at field heads, drawing and sketching on paper on the spot.

Anyone in the village with field property was called to be questioned. Those with deeds, those without deeds, landlords, tenant farmers, not one left, all like going to court. The village also posted notices, saying this was called "Clarifying Fields and Acres." Land deeds issued by Great Ming in the past all had to be re-surveyed in the hands of "Great Song." Those with land disputes, those without land deeds, could be cleared and reissued on the spot after investigation. Those whose lands were embezzled could also report on the spot.

For a time, the whole Li Family Enclosure bustled like a boiling pot. Although Li Family Enclosure was called "Li Family," it was not a single-surname village of the Li family. The Li family originally relied on the power of the big surname to embezzled sand fields reclaimed by many small surnames in the village, and occupied many public lands and wastelands as their own. Therefore, once this Australian "Clarifying Fields and Acres" started, small surnames took revenge for grievances. Although on the surface no one came out to criticize, secret reporting documents were like snowflakes. Finally after clearing and measuring, the Li family lost one-fifth of their land in total. Six people were arrested for "having historical crimes"; some were sentenced to exile, some fined.

For a time, the Li family's arrogance fell greatly; small surnames were greatly encouraged. However, the Li family had many people and great power after all. Although suffering a blow, matters of this Li Family Enclosure were still decided by his family. Just that they were no longer as tyrannical as in the past.

Fields passed the clear road. Although taxes were still Great Ming's old rules, at least they were paid clearly. Whose family had more and better land paid more; whose family had less and worse land paid less. There were no more poor people paying tax for rich people, or inexplicable "Additional Levies" that existed just by grain runners touching upper lip to lower lip. In the eyes of common people, this was the simplest and clearest justice. People up and down Li Family Enclosure originally had some contempt for these thief bandits coming from the sea, but at this moment, they had a little admiration. This method! This ability! Things the government couldn't figure out or clarify for decades or centuries, they cleared up as soon as they came. So old men said again "This is new dynasty new atmosphere." Naturally there were also those "seeing the minute"; saying this was just because Australians were "newcomers," handling affairs without scruples, nor having interests, so they could be so "clear and bright." Whatever days were long later would be hard to say.

Even more people said, regardless of whether they truly had ability or just touched the light of "new dynasty new atmosphere," whose hand the deer of this world would die in was still hard to say. Great Ming's Son of Heaven was still sitting in the court. These thief bandits were just occupying a corner.
