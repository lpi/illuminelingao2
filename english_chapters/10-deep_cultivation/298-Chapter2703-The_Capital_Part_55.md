# Chapter 2703: The Capital (Part 55)

Old Feng laughed. "Little bastard, you've got guts! You'll be someone of consequence one day!"

Little Bazi clumsily remounted his donkey and rode slowly alongside Liao Sanniang. Through their conversation, the two grew much closer.

Little Bazi said, "Although your son is untalented, I hope to make some progress so I won't lose face for my Adoptive Mother. In the future, I will need Adoptive Mother to take pains to guide me."

Liao Sanniang smiled. "I've long seen in the Bureau that you are observant and capable. I intended to take you under my wing; even if you hadn't asked, I would have trained you to become talented. We martial artists don't have so many empty formalities; we only look at strength and courage. Since ancient times, martial arts have fallen into the categories of horsemanship, archery, spear and saber, and weightlifting—the so-called Horse, Step, Bow, Blade, and Stone. The foundation is building strength; without strength, all martial arts are useless. If an opponent thrusts a spear at you and you can't parry it, you'll simply be stabbed to death. Let me test you: do you know about that military examination a few years ago?"

Little Bazi paused, tilting his head to think. "Are you talking about the Palace Examination for the Military Zhuangyuan?"

Liao Sanniang nodded approvingly. "You actually know of it."

Little Bazi said, "I was a few years younger then, but I vaguely remember when the results of the Metropolitan Military Examination were posted that year. Only two candidates could wield the hundred-jin heavy halberd. Yet one was rejected, and only one was accepted. Critics all said it was unfair, and the matter caused quite a clamor in the capital."

Liao Sanniang nodded. "That was the fourth year of Chongzhen. The rejected candidate was named Xu Yanqi, and the other was named Wang Laipin. Later, in the Palace Examination, Wang Laipin became the Zhuangyuan. That Xu Yanqi was unlucky and didn't hit the 'Triple First,' but if he hadn't been able to wield the hundred-jin blade that day and display his prowess, who would have stood up to argue for him?"

"Not getting first place is fine too, saves your butt from being poked!" Old Feng laughed.

"Poked? Poked... butt?" Little Bazi was dumbfounded.

In the Ming military examinations, there was an inexplicable and vulgar tradition: after the Military Zhuangyuan was named and paraded through the streets draped in red, the clerks and officials would swarm up, shouting "Poke the Zhuangyuan's butt!" The Zhuangyuan would have to flee in disarray, only being let off once he reached the gates of the Ministry of Rites.

Hearing Old Feng's explanation, everyone laughed. Little Bazi said indignantly, "What kind of custom is that? Not to mention being crude, it's an extreme insult to martial artists."

Liao Sanniang laughed, "You always mix in these irrelevant trifles! I'm talking serious business!"

Liao Sanniang sighed softly, feeling a bit emotional. After a moment, she continued: "My Liao family has its own methods for throwing, catching, and lifting stone locks, supplemented by massage and kneading, and external application of ointments. This is the so-called systematic training and recovery method of the Great Song. I have practiced it since childhood; it is best for increasing strength without causing injury. After we are done with matters here, I will pass it on to you."

Little Bazi hurriedly said, "Thank you, Adoptive Mother."

After traveling for a while, Little Bazi asked again, "Adoptive Mother, what school of martial arts do we belong to?"

Liao Sanniang said, "My skills are family heirlooms. Martial arts in this age rarely circulate; each family hides their secrets. Therefore, aside from military martial arts, most are passed down within families from father to son or between brothers. Even the Shaolin Temple, starting from Master Fuyu in the Yuan Dynasty, established a generation lineage system based on secular clan laws, passing down the mantle from master to disciple generation after generation, much like blood inheritance."

Liao Sanniang paused, then added: "Although my family uses the saber—specifically the single saber—my saber technique was not inherited from my family, but from the lineage of Lady Wa."

Little Bazi asked, "Which hero is this Lady Wa?"

Liao Sanniang replied, "Lady Wa was of the Shizhu Pacification Commission. In the thirty-third year of Jiajing, when Japanese pirates invaded the coast, the Jiajing Emperor conscripted Lady Wa from Tianzhou in Guangxi to command the native troops and 'Wolf Soldiers' of various prefectures to resist the pirates. Lady Wa, at the age of sixty, led the army herself, bringing her sons and grandsons, traveling ten thousand *li* to quell the disaster. Before battle, she swore, 'On this trip, I vow not to live under the same sky as the thieves.' In February, she arrived in Suzhou and was assigned by Governor-General Zhang Jing to serve under General Yu Dayou. Later, she fought continuous battles with the Japanese pirates at Jinshan and Songjiang. The Wolf Soldiers were brave and fierce, beheading over a hundred. The pirates' morale was broken, and they retreated to Zhelin. In April, Yan Song's adopted son Zhao Wenhua pressured Zhang Jing to send Lady Wa to attack Zhelin. When she reached Caojing, she was ambushed by pirates. The pirates encircled her several times. Lady Wa, with her hair loose and dancing with her saber, charged back and forth on her horse. The pirates tried to drag her horse down by the tail, nearly pulling all the hair out, but the Lady fought through the blood, broke the siege, and seized the pass. Later, joining with the main army, she defeated the Japanese pirates and sea barbarians at Wangjiangjing. To this day, the local folk song 'Flower Family Wa, Can Kill Japs' is still sung. Lady Wa: body old but heart still strong, spirit firm through long battles. Thinking of it now still makes one's blood boil; I hate that I was not born in the same era to kill pirates alongside her." Saying this, Liao Sanniang involuntarily clenched her right hand into a fist and punched her left palm.

Liao Sanniang paused here, then continued: "Ten years ago, I followed my father to Guangzhou. One day, I saw an old Li man selling furs in the market. My father saw that his bearing was dignified and extraordinary. Upon chatting, we learned that his female ancestor was a female captain under Lady Wa who had learned Lady Wa's Double Saber techniques. I admired Lady Wa's loyalty and courage and wished to emulate her, so I begged my father to part with a sum of money to let me apprentice under him and learn this Double Saber method. I heard that Xiang Yuanchi, the Young Hero of Tiandu, obtained Lady Wa's true transmission. If I had the fortune to be taught by him, it would be a beautiful thing. But counting the years, he should have passed away long ago. Even if he were alive, his age would be extremely great; I fear it is impossible." At this point, Liao Sanniang shook her head regretfully.

Little Bazi said no more, but memorized the lineage in his heart.

Little Bazi asked, "Lady Sanniang, have you seen the officials of the Great Song? What do these Aussie-Song officials look like?"

Liao Sanniang thought for a moment and said, "As the women's representative for the escort industry, I attended the Women's Representative Congress and met Officer Du of the Women's Federation. This Women's Federation is a government office specifically managing women's affairs."

Hearing this, Little Bazi said, "Oh, so it's the Great Song's Jiaofangsi (Music Office)."

Liao Sanniang giggled upon hearing this. "That's not it. The Jiaofangsi manages actors and entertainers. The Great Song has various literary and art troupes, but they are managed by Culture and Education. This Women's Federation commands all women under heaven. Whether you are a chaste martyr or a brothel whore, you fall under her jurisdiction. Officer Du is a female official, but she... hmm, her conduct is quite erratic. Whether they are the Prime Ministers and Vice Ministers of the center, or the Ministers and Vice Ministers of the Six Ministries, they all flee when they see her. Even Minister Wen and Director Ma get a headache over her. Everyone calls her 'The Queen'; she is an awkward figure in the Political Hall."

Little Bazi clicked his tongue. "Mother, a woman with such official authority? What great prestige."

Liao Sanniang said, "It's not exactly official authority; those Senators seem almost like they've been cowed by a tiger. After the women's meeting that day, I saw Director Xiao of the General Office talking with several Senators. When they saw Officer Du coming, Director Xiao's face immediately changed color, and he shouted 'The Heroine holds court!', and everyone instantly scattered. But I saw that Officer Du looked frail, not like someone who practices martial arts. I don't know what formidable boxing she uses. But she treated me well, and introduced me in audiences several times."

Little Bazi asked curiously, "What is this General Office?"

Liao Sanniang said, "It's like the inner court service and attendant squads in the Forbidden City. But the Aussie-Song has a figurehead monarch and no Great Inner Palace, so this General Office has become the bureau that serves the Senators."

Little Bazi wondered, "Then what is that?"

Liao Sanniang was getting a bit impatient with the continuous questions and replied offhandedly, "It's the Twenty-Four Yamen."

Little Bazi suddenly understood. "Oh, so it's the Directorate of Ceremonial. This Director Xiao must be a Grand Eunuch of the palace—perhaps the Director of Ceremonial?"

Liao Sanniang hurriedly corrected him. "No, no, no. He's more like the head of the Aussie-Song's Clan Court. Oh, right, the personal bodyguards of the Senators are also deployed by the General Office. If you have real skill and can be selected for that in the future, it would be like green smoke rising from your ancestral grave."

Little Bazi sighed, "If only I knew where my ancestral grave was!"

Old Feng said, "What does an ancestral grave matter? Death is like a lamp going out; why cling to a dirt mound? You are young now and have apprenticed under Liao Sanniang. The Great Song's national power is rising daily; your future is boundless."

Liao Sanniang tilted her head and thought for a moment. "At first, when I looked upon the Great Song's celebrations, I thought I would see the robes and caps of the Imperial Song again and witness the majesty of the imperial insignia. But when they came out, I saw only simple ceremonial guards. All the Senators had short hair and short tunics with buttons down the front. Even those who kept their hair wore it loose. There were no purple robes or golden fish pouches, no long-legged soft caps. Their shirts were so short they couldn't cover their bellies, dressed like short-term hired laborers. Yet each tried their best to put on an air of solemnity and dignity. The common people watching all laughed in secret. To use a new phrase, they 'felt good about themselves.' How one sees oneself and how others see one is always different; truly, ugliness knows not itself. Plus, the Great Song Senators are all fair-skinned and flabby; at a glance, they all look like eunuchs." At this point, recalling the appearances of the various Senators, Liao Sanniang found it more and more amusing and couldn't help covering her mouth and giggling.

Little Bazi looked puzzled, unable to imagine such an appearance. After all, Manager Leng looked no different from the local merchant masters in both appearance and temperament, only appearing much more capable than them.

Old Feng took a puff of his pipe and said leisurely, "Lady Sanniang! You should watch your tongue when speaking to a child! Don't let him learn to be loose-tongued; it will cause big trouble in the future!"

Liao Sanniang hurriedly said, "We are just joking a bit here in this remote place. In the future, if you follow me back to Lingao, you must not forget your place and spout nonsense like this."

Little Bazi nodded and asked, "Do we address the Senators as 'Grand Master'?"

Liao Sanniang said, "No. In the Great Song, they are called 'Chief' (*Shou-zhang*). 'Head' (*Shou*) means superior, superior means noble; 'Senior' (*Zhang*) means prior, prior means respected. Being both respected and noble, they are the Chiefs."

Little Bazi memorized this and said, "Your son understands. In the future, when I arrive in Lingao, I will never confuse the order of rank."

Liao Sanniang said, "In the future, I will take you brothers to Lingao myself. See the sky there, see the land there, see the Wenlan River banks blooming like brocade, see the lights of East Gate Market stretching for ten *li*. See this dazzling world, see this magnificent landscape."

After speaking, Liao Sanniang gave a clear, ringing laugh, spurred her horse into a light gallop, and caught up with the main group.

Little Bazi also hurriedly urged his mule to follow closely.

In the waist-high dry grass by the roadside, a clump of grass blades was pushed aside. Through the gap, a pair of eyes silently watched the mule cart depart. After a moment, the grass rustled shut, leaving behind a deathly silence.
