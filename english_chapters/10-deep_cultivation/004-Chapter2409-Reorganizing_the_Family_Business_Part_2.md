# Chapter 2409: Reorganizing the Family Business (II)

"Didn't the ancestral hall distribute grain for relief?"

"The Clan Leader is dead, the Clan Elders are dead or fled; there isn't a single person who can call the shots. Besides, the clan was ruined miserably by the passing soldiers this time. Money and grain were all robbed clean. If the Australians hadn't come later and sent some grain relief, who knows how many would have starved to death." Chen Yue was full of grievances. "Besides, now Second Uncle holds power and has become the Manager of the ancestral hall; no one else's words work."

The Second Uncle Chen Yue spoke of was actually her biological father. However, Chen Yue despised and hated this biological father, not treating him as family at all.

"What? Second Uncle holds power?" Chen Lin was shocked upon hearing this. Second Uncle usually ate, drank, whored, and gambled; who knew how many absurd things he had done. Back in the weaving workshop, he had embezzled silk ready for delivery, eventually causing the weaving workshop to lose money and apologize to settle the matter, making Chen Lin's father extremely embarrassed. From then on, he was not allowed into the weaving workshop and was only given some pocket money every month.

Even if the clan had no elders, whoever took charge shouldn't be this profligate son!

Chen Lin's family was one of the three branches passed down from the Chen family's eldest branch; they were the direct line of descent. Although his father had not served as Clan Leader, he had always held the status of a Clan Elder whose words carried immense weight within the clan. The position of Manager had also always been held by him.

Father died; it was considered orthodox for a brother to succeed as Manager. But Second Uncle was famously absurd and improper; what was the clan thinking?

"Why not let Third Uncle be the Manager?"

Chen Yue looked around and said, "Let's talk about it later. You just came back; go home and have a look first."

Chen Lin was full of suspicion but knew his sister must have difficulties speaking, so he didn't pursue the question. His sister was right; since he was back, he should go home first.

The three returned home together. They saw it was exactly as Chen Yue had described: walls toppled and houses collapsed, devastating sight everywhere. The huge three-courtyard compound didn't even have a single small room left habitable. The courtyard was left with many pits of various sizes.

Needless to say, the family's valuables were looted clean, and the furniture and furnishings were mostly damaged. Although these pieces of furniture weren't particularly precious, they had been passed down from generation to generation from ancestors, repaired, maintained, and added to over generations, accompanying the family day and night. Now only debris on the ground remained. The chaotic soldiers, for unknown reasons, had smashed them all to pieces and discarded them on the ground.

Father's favorite jasmine tree, originally bowl-thick and full of flowers in summer with fragrance drifting outside the courtyard, had been chopped down from the waist.

Looking at the mess in the courtyard, Chen Lin sighed; it was truly a catastrophe!

Chen Yue thought he was heartache over the family property and comforted him: "Brother Alin, it's good that you are fine. Now that Dad is gone, you are the pillar of the whole family..."

Mother died early, Father did not remarry and only had a concubine, but she had no children and also died last year. After Father left, the whole family only had him and this sister left.

Thinking of this, he couldn't help feeling a wave of sadness and asked, "Where is Dad's coffin parked now?"

"Dad's body was only found two months ago," Chen Yue said, tears rolling down. "It was soaked out of shape. It was Third Uncle who recognized him from a seal he carried... The elders said such a corpse couldn't be kept, better to bury it for peace as soon as possible—he was buried that day."

Chen Lin thought of his father's tragic state and couldn't help weeping like rain. After a long time, he said: "Ayue, go prepare incense, candles, and paper money for me. I will go to pay respects at Father's grave."

The two went to the ancestral grave to pay respects. Chen Lin saw the graveyard was also disturbed severely. The sacrificial vessels stored in the graveyard were looted, and doors and windows were all destroyed. His heart felt sorrowful. After crying and sacrificing before his father's grave, the siblings got up. Chen Lin proposed to visit the weaving workshop, but Chen Yue shook her head:

"Big Brother, it's better you don't go to the weaving workshop."

"Why? Was it also destroyed?"

"The weaving workshop wasn't damaged much—the chaotic soldiers only took the stock; buildings and looms weren't damaged much. It started work again a month ago..."

"Started work?" Chen Lin was surprised. After the soldier chaos, everything was waiting to be rebuilt, and clansmen even had problems eating. Where did the money come from to start work?

Silk weaving required heavy capital. Purchasing raw silk required cash. The sold silk fabrics, however, required waiting for the three festivals to settle accounts and return funds. Since the chaotic soldiers plundered the raw silk stock, how could they start work without raw materials? Even if the clan paid to repurchase, it was winter now, and silkworms hadn't even started hatching; where would cocoons and raw silk come from?

"How to start work without raw silk?" Chen Lin turned to leave. "Let's go, go to the weaving workshop to see!"

Chen Yue grabbed his arm: "Brother! If you want to go look, I won't stop you, but I have a few words to tell you first..."

Chen Lin was surprised, knowing there was something fishy in this, and stopped his steps: "Speak."

"Brother Alin, now the weaving workshop is managed by Second Uncle..."

Chen Lin started, then sneered: "That's not surprising. He's even became the Clan Temple Manager now." He suddenly thought of something and asked: "How did the clan elders let him be the Manager?"

Chen Yue looked around, seeing it was desolate with no one around, she pulled Chen Lin into the graveyard, found a place to sit, and then whispered:

"Brother Alin... don't get angry. I'll tell you quietly, Second Uncle has hooked up with the Short-hair Thieves now!"

"What?!" Chen Lin was shocked and hurriedly asked, "Really?"

"En!" Chen Yue nodded heavily and continued: "When the chaotic soldiers sacked Nansha, everyone scrambled to escape and scattered—I followed Third Uncle's family to Third Aunt's maiden home in Sanliang Market and hid for more than two months. Later, the Australians issued a notice saying Guangzhou Prefecture's ground was pacified and refugees could return home. For those without travel expenses, major market towns had free scheduled boats to send them. Third Uncle's family and I watched for a few days, seeing it was indeed safe, we took the Australians' boat home together.

"Back in the village, we saw that seventy or eighty percent of those who fled had returned. Everyone was busy fixing houses and encoffining bodies. The Australians also distributed some money and grain to the village for relief. When Second Uncle encountered the Australians while fleeing, somehow, he got the official position of 'Liaison Officer' for Nansha Village."

"That's not an official position; it's just something like Baojia."

"But he used this 'Liaison Officer' title to shake things up. Because he could communicate with the Australians, the clan elders also looked highly upon him and let him handle matters. Unexpectedly, not long after, borrowing the Australians' influence, he demanded the clan let him be the Ancestral Hall Manager. Clan elders were dead or fled; the remaining ones had no backbone. Pressed by him like this, they could only let him be the Manager. Third Uncle didn't agree and had a big quarrel with him in the Ancestral Hall, then left the next day."

Chen Lin understood. His good-for-nothing Second Uncle took the chance of chaotic times to seize power. Needless to say, the weaving workshop was also seized by him. Third Uncle had a steady temperament and was the most composed of the three brothers. Since childhood, he had never seen Third Uncle lose his temper. For him to quarrel big with Second Uncle and leave in anger, it definitely wasn't entirely because he became the Manager.

"Where did Third Uncle go?"

"Third Uncle's family went back to Sanliang—originally they wanted to take me too. I thought since there was no news of you, Brother, I wanted to wait for you to come back, so I stayed."

He suddenly thought of another problem and asked: "There is no raw silk on the market now. And Second Uncle never managed the weaving workshop; who is managing matters in the weaving workshop specifically?"

Chen Yue looked around again before saying: "The ones managing the weaving workshop now are Short-hairs."

"What?!" This time Chen Lin almost dropped his jaw in shock. The Australians even came to the village to run a weaving workshop? This was too beyond his expectations. He busily asked: "Real Short-hairs or False Short-hairs?"

"False Short-hairs—actually they don't shave their heads. They just all speak Short-hair language and shipped in many new machines—all shipped using Australian boats! Second Uncle also said these people all came from Qiongzhou Prefecture and are capable lieutenants under the Australians."

As expected! Second Uncle had no ability to manage and operate the weaving workshop. If the workshop fell into his hands, the only result would be embezzlement until empty. Now that it could be operated, obviously it relied on these False Short-hairs.

But what intention did these False Short-hairs have running specifically to Nansha to append a weaving workshop? For reeling silk and weaving silk, there were plenty of workshops inside and outside Guangzhou city. Why come specifically to Nansha?

He felt increasingly confused, but since the Short-hairs had intervened in the weaving workshop right before his eyes, the possibility of him taking it back was very slim.

"You must not go head-to-head with Second Uncle," Chen Yue reminded. "Second Uncle has the backing of the Short-hair Thieves now; no one in the village dares to provoke him. Just a few days ago, Uncle Zhi of the Sixth Branch was grabbed to the Ancestral Hall and beaten because he went against his will, and was fined one *dan* of rice. Everyone went to plead leniency, promising to pay after harvesting rice next year, before the person was released."

"In the end, he is just one person. The village just lets him act wildly? Even if the Australians back him, it's just a few False Short-hairs. I've gained seen many False Short-hairs in Guangzhou; the Australians restrain their subordinates most severely and don't allow them to do unlawful things. These few False Short-hairs probably dare not publicly back him up."

"This, I don't know. Village people are scared out of their wits hearing 'Short-hair Thieves' and 'Australians'—Brother Alin, do you still remember the matter of Australians besieging Guangzhou a few years ago?"

Naturally, he remembered. Australian warships sailed along the river channels, levying grain and grass everywhere. Any who dared resist or disobey were slaughtered; unknown numbers of big clans and households were ruined.

"...The most infuriating thing is those outsiders who originally worked in the weaving workshop. Now with the backing of False Short-hairs and being reeled in by Second Uncle, every one of them is willing to be Second Uncle's claws and teeth, acting tyrannically in the village. Now Chen family people conversely dare not speak loudly."

Chen Lin remained silent. He originally thought even if Father was gone, the clan elders could maintain the situation. With the one hundred yuan borrowed from Cousin-uncle, he could slowly repair the house, restore the weaving workshop, and reorganize the family business.

Now it seemed he had thought too simply.

He pondered for a moment and said: "Sister, I should still walk around the village. Take a look at the situation."
