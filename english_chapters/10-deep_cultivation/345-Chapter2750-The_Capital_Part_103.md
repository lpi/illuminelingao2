# Chapter 2750: The Capital (Part 102)

By comparison, the Stone Elder Group's organization and execution of intelligence work had quite a modern flavor.

With knowledge, learning is actually quite fast.

Thinking back to the intelligence the Foreign Intelligence Bureau had collected recently, some discerning people within the Ming had actually begun to recognize the Short-Hairs' advantages.

Of course, their understanding still mostly remained at the technical level—strong ships and fierce cannons. They couldn't appreciate the Senate's institutional advantages. But even just acknowledging and learning from the technical level could bring enormous progress.

Wouldn't it be wonderful if the Ming launched a "Short-Hair Affairs Movement"?

Xu Ke's thinking differed from many Senators. He didn't support technology blockades. The Senate wasn't just a company with pure profit motives. They still held the belief of "transforming heaven and earth."

Relying solely on the Senate's power, achieving this goal might take over a hundred years. But if they could export culture, knowledge, technology, and ideas to the Ming—letting them emulate the Senate's methods, open factories, establish schools, cultivate talent—the resources available to the Senate in the future would be much greater. Perhaps the process could be greatly shortened.

"The run didn't work?"

"No, sir." Xu Yong said quietly. "Only the first day was crowded. The second and third days were much lighter. I quietly inquired—Shanxi House lost their nerve at the last minute and didn't go!"

Zhou Lezhi's expression was grave. "What does Manager Shen say?"

"He's now telling everyone he's sick. Hiding in the bank, seeing no one. I was afraid Shen's place might have hidden observers, so I didn't dare go find him."

"Right, you're thinking correctly." Zhou Lezhi said. "Someone at the forefront like him—the Short-Hairs certainly have him under surveillance. Anyway, the run has failed. He's no longer important. Let him hide for now."

"Yes."

"The Leng Ningyun matter has now failed. With the mission incomplete, the Short-Hairs will certainly retaliate massively. Even right at the Emperor's feet, it's probably not safe. From now on, don't go to Lord Wang's residence anymore. Let the courier handle liaisons. Understand?"

"I understand!" Xu Yong said.

"Good. You may go. Be careful."

Xu Yong hesitated, then said quietly: "Sir! Word comes from Lord Liu that the Brocade Guard is secretly investigating your background..."

"Oh?" Zhou Lezhi frowned. "Know why?"

"Lord Liu isn't sure. He only knows it's on orders from the Brocade Guard's ranking officer, Lord Wu. He says he'll work on it from behind. He advises you not to be active these days."

"Tell him I understand. I'll rest here these days. Won't go anywhere."

After Xu Yong withdrew, Zhou Lezhi felt quite pleased with Liu Sha's young apprentice. Not only clever, but lacking the shallow vanity of clever children. In major matters, he was very steady. Liu Sha had told him: This kid Xu Yong is good material.

Perhaps Master had once seen himself the same way? Zhou Lezhi couldn't help feeling a bit proud.

Thinking of his master, Zhou Lezhi realized the capital was no longer safe for him. Though he'd made many arrangements to conceal his identity, the fact that he practiced medicine outside with Wang Yehao as his patron wasn't exactly secret among the capital's powerful families. Of course, this alone couldn't prove any special relationship with Lord Wang. After all, hundreds of various people claimed connection to Lord Wang. He was just one of them.

But while this might fool the Brocade Guard, it might not deceive the Short-Hairs. The Short-Hairs were notoriously cunning and ruthless, forcing him to be extra cautious. Moving away from Chongxiao Temple was to avoid attention for now. Before this, he'd already noticed suspicious persons appearing near the temple.

His current lodging was near Guangji Temple in Mingyufang, west of the city. This area was close to the Imperial City, surrounded mostly by temples and government warehouses. With wide spaces and few people, it was quite peaceful. He planned to hide here for a while and figure things out, using this time to quietly review everything since he'd begun serving Lord Wang.

Though Leng Ningyun had escaped, he hadn't given up on peace negotiations. The court attacking the Short-Hairs was tantamount to suicide—this had always been his view. But now, having lost the trump card of Leng Ningyun, the "two-pronged approach" was finished. He could only find another path—first blocking the anti-Short-Hair war machine from starting at court.

One day toward the end of the first month of Chongzhen 10 (February 1637), the air still smelled of spent firecrackers, and red and brown firecracker casings still littered the streets. The capital's street vendors had already begun their early bustling. Hawking calls from the stalls were endless. Pedestrians on the streets were still discussing various rumors about the great Delong case. This was the biggest "gossip news" in the capital these days and the most relished topic among common folk in their spare time. In all ages and places, people always treated "major affairs" unrelated to themselves as entertainment.

The Forbidden City, outside Qianqing Palace.

Yang Sichang adjusted his official attire and, guided by a eunuch, strode into the hall. The butterfly of history had flapped its wings due to the transmigrators' arrival. The Ming's internal and external troubles were more severe than in the other timeline. Thus he hadn't refused the Emperor's dispensation from mourning three times as in the original timeline, returning to the capital several months earlier than originally to present his pacification strategy to the Chongzhen Emperor. Today he would present this plan to the Son of Heaven.

This was the long-awaited moment he had carefully prepared for. His father's conviction and colleagues' ostracism hadn't dampened his intense loyalty to Emperor and country. From his performance as a provincial governor to his diligent service since arriving in the capital, he had proven his loyalty and ability to this young sovereign. Today, in this great hall, as one ruler and one minister, they would determine the future of this declining empire. He believed the Emperor's determination to rule with diligence was his greatest support. With his talents, he would surely pacify the realm and restore the Ming. Whether roving bandits, Eastern Barbarians, or Short-Hairs—none could stop him.

After the formalities, the Chongzhen Emperor said:

"Since We assumed the throne, though We have drawn close to worthy ministers and distanced petty men, eradicated the Wei traitors and rectified the court, internal and external troubles have increased rather than decreased. At court, factions attack each other. Regional governors either practice self-preservation and accomplish nothing, or sit in their positions like rotten wood knowing nothing of governance. Few capable ministers can share the Emperor's burdens. In the north, the Eastern Barbarians frequently raid our passes, plundering Our subjects. Within, roving bandits run rampant in all directions, disturbing the people's peace. The foreign Short-Hairs have seized Liangguang and frequently raid the Fujian and Zhejiang coasts, usurping imperial titles. Recently, We received a report from Southern Zhili that three Short-Hair fast ships raided Songjiang, eyeing the Yangtze, and an entire naval garrison couldn't repel them. This is most disappointing. We have long heard of your talents and have specially summoned you before the throne, ending your mourning period, precisely to deliberate on campaigns against the Eastern Barbarians, roving bandits, and Short-Hairs. As long as these rebellious traitors remain, the Ming realm cannot know peace."

The transmigrators, with their old-timeline knowledge, had a very clear understanding of the late Ming situation: the fundamental cause of the crisis was fiscal bankruptcy. The causes of bankruptcy were many—the Little Ice Age's natural disasters on one hand, intensifying land concentration on another, and an antiquated fiscal and tax system at the root.

Given the Ming's territory, population, products, and economic conditions, an inefficient ruling apparatus maintaining control shouldn't have been too difficult. The Little Ice Age's sudden onset broke this fragile balance. Peasants at the bottom, tormented by natural disasters and plagues, could no longer bear heavy taxes and went bankrupt in droves. The desolate countryside became fertile ground for peasant armies. The court's already inefficient and corrupt fiscal system thus fell into deadlock. Fiscal bankruptcy caused administrative and military capabilities to decline sharply, followed by rebellion in the frontier tributaries... Add officials' pervasive corruption, and the Ming Dynasty spiraled into the abyss under this vicious cycle.

The discerning people of the time, including Yang Sichang, naturally couldn't be completely unaware of these problems. But to eliminate abuses meant taking on the vested interests. The Ming's gentry and imperial clan groups were enormous. Without rulers with the courage and insight for radical surgery, no one dared touch them. The Emperor worked diligently and earnestly, yet was extremely sensitive to "court opinion." Given such hesitation, attempting sweeping "reforms" was suicidal. Yang Sichang was very aware of the risks and thus avoided these issues. In his view, the Ming had vast territories and large population, with abundant resources. With diligent governance, "restoration" was still possible. Even if they couldn't recreate a "prosperous era," at worst they could maintain the status quo.

Now he said solemnly:

"Since ancient times, loyalty and filial piety cannot both be fully served. By Your Majesty's grace, this subject shall dedicate my life in service and my death in gratitude, to repay Your Majesty's trust."

With that, he kowtowed in the hall.

The Chongzhen Emperor nodded. "Rise. Speak your piece."

"Thank you, Your Majesty. As Minister Yu said, 'A strong army rests on sufficient food; resisting foreign threats begins with internal security.' Without a strong army, bandits cannot be swept away; without sufficient grain, the army cannot be strengthened. Today's regional garrisons have long gone unpaid. This subject has observed the Jizhen garrison and Capital armies: of combat-ready soldiers, not one in ten is usable. Military households sell sons and daughters to survive. Such exhausted troops cannot match fierce enemies. Moreover, when soldiers are impoverished, they often become bandits themselves. This subject has heard that among the roving bandits, many soldiers from the Yansui, Guyuan, Ningxia, and Gansu garrisons have mixed in—even sons of military families have joined the rebels."

"It all comes down to four words: troops, horses, money, grain. But raising funds is easy to say, hard to practice." At this, the Chongzhen Emperor sighed.

Four words, but really just one: money.

Throughout history, the collapse of any political entity begins with fiscal collapse. The Ming was no exception. Arrears to garrisons everywhere had been normal since his grandfather Wanli's time. Only in wartime, to motivate troops, would they pay some back wages. As for combat rewards—frankly, the Ming's military rewards had always been meager. Compared to systematic spoils-distribution organizations like the Eight Banners, the incentive system wasn't in the same league. And now, disbursing over 100,000 taels before major battles to reward troops and replenish supplies was already stretching the Ministry of Revenue thin.
