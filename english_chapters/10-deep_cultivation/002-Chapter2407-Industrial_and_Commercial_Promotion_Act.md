# Chapter 2407: Industrial and Commercial Promotion Act

**January 2, 1636**

As the first New Year since the "Great Song Public Calendar" was formally promulgated in Guangzhou, the Great Song Guangzhou Municipal Government spared no effort in promoting the Public Calendar New Year. On the occasion of "New Year's Day" on January 1st, it was announced that government offices and schools would have a five-day holiday.

Shops and workshops inside and outside Guangzhou city also followed the rules, taking a holiday from New Year's Day and waiting until the fifth day to welcome the God of Wealth before opening for business.

Some trading businesses, reluctant to give up the best business opportunity of the year, told their clerks to take turns resting. Although the Australians hadn't issued any official document for "scholars and commoners to execute uniformly," everyone felt it was better to play along and show support.

After the Australians arrived, their thunder and rain (power and benevolence) had rubbed the scholars and commoners of the city into a daze. Especially the gentry and big households; most were terrified and uneasy. In the Witchcraft Case, hundreds of gentry and big households inside and outside the city had their families broken; and not long after the plague ended, the "New Tax System" began to be promoted.

Since ancient times, countless heads had rolled because of tax collection. Although the Australians were not bloodthirsty, the frequent "exiling" in several major cases recently also made them tremble with fear. Because Australian exile was not just one person; it was often the whole family being exiled. Although they were allowed to take property and population, the places of exile were all "remote and evil prefectures" that everyone had never heard of. Being exiled was essentially a one-way trip.

Perhaps the Australians also realized that the recent slaughter was too severe, and coupled with the plague last year that had greatly damaged Guangzhou's vitality, they consciously downplayed the atmosphere of purification starting from December and began to lively prepare various celebrations. Everywhere was decorated with lanterns and colorful festoons. On New Year's Eve, large-scale fireworks were set off at Bai'etan and other places. Various kinds of large fireworks were fired for more than half an hour, illuminating half the sky with colorful sparkles, making the whole city crazy with excitement.

The Guangzhou Federation of Industry and Commerce also held a Group Greeting on the second day of the New Year. For the members of the Federation, although the Group Greeting was just a formality, it was also a "reassurance pill." It allowed the industrialists and merchants, who had been alarmed for a whole year, to relax a bit.

At the Group Greeting, Lin Baiguang, who presided over the meeting, and Liu Xiang, who came specially, not only spoke some polite words but also specifically mentioned a series of "Industrial and Commercial Promotion Acts" of the Senate, including the "Nanyang Company" plan that had been clamorous recently.

Besides the Nanyang Company's stock and bond issuance, there was also a series of specific industrial investment projects. Mayor Liu personally gave speeches on them, tireless in his details—of course, as the Mayor of Guangzhou, vigorously organizing industry and commerce was his consistent tenet. Besides the relocated and newly built enterprises in the Planning Agency's plan, encouraging local industrialists and merchants to set up entities was also the common idea of all colleagues in the Planning Agency and the Municipal Government.

It wasn't just the Planning Agency and the Guangzhou Municipal Government that were interested in "diffusing production capacity"; the agricultural and light industry departments were also rubbing their palms, ready to do a big job on this hot land of Guangzhou. Wu Nanhai was also鼓捣ing (tinkering/scheming) to launch a "patent transfer," preparing to transfer a batch of civilian technologies to Guangzhou's big households in the form of patents for a fee, letting them invest in setting up factories.

Although these projects had not yet been issued in the form of formal documents, the general content had already been disclosed by Liu Xiang to the big households on the PPT today.

The projects seemed varied, but actually, they all belonged to "agricultural product processing," and the largest and most important project among them was "cotton spinning."

Cotton spinning was an industry the Senate had not paid much attention to in the past. The reason was simply that the Senate lacked a stable source of cotton and had to face competition from cheap Indian cotton cloth and Songjiang cotton cloth. Therefore, although the Senate had established spinning mills and textile factories over these years, their scale was not large, mainly used to produce certain special textile products. Bulk cotton fabrics were mostly imported from India and the Great Ming.

After occupying the Two Guangs, the problem of cotton supply had been basically solved. Secondly, various departments had complaints about the existing "local cloth," whether it was Indian cotton cloth or Songjiang cotton cloth. From an application perspective, cotton textiles had very extensive uses in industrial and civilian fields, but the current small number of spindles under the Senate's industrial control kept the Senate's special textile products hovering at a relatively low production level, whether in output, variety, or technology.

Expanding the production scale of cotton textiles was soon put on the agenda. According to the Senate's established policy for running industries, such light industries were consistently carried out using the model of "attracting private capital investment." Thus, the "Guangzhou Industrial and Commercial Promotion Act" was launched.

After Lin Baiguang finished hosting the Group Greeting, he hosted a banquet for the members. Glasses clinked, and it was very lively. Everyone seemed quite happy. After eating and drinking to saturation, Wu Yijun bid farewell to his acquaintances and sat in his sedan chair to return to his residence, pondering the motives of the "Short-hairs" all the way.

He was not originally in the cloth business, but a merchant who did dried fruit wholesale. However, that piece of sandy land in the south was his; the Short-hairs had bought it, and he heard people say that a "Real Short-hair" had specifically gone to take a look around, which made him sniff a business opportunity. He had long been envious of Gao Ju; since contacting the Short-hairs, Gao Ju had quickly become one of the top big households. But before the "liberation" of Guangzhou, Wu Yijun had no intersection with Short-hair industries. Originally, he just followed the crowd, coming here to mark his attendance.

Unexpectedly, there was such a scene at this Group Greeting! This so-called "Industrial and Commercial Promotion Act" was the Senate's investment promotion conference.

And among these projects at the conference, he was most interested in cotton spinning. Because he had many newly reclaimed sandy fields in his hands. These sandy fields currently had no great use other than growing cotton. But just selling cotton wouldn't earn much money; spinning and weaving it oneself could earn the maximum profit. And judging by the Australians' appetite for cotton cloth now, doing this line of business wouldn't need to worry about sales—both Mayor Liu and Director Lin had explicitly stated that the Senate would fully support local industries.

However, local cotton spinning in Guangzhou Prefecture was originally not as strong as silk weaving. The market was mostly Songjiang cloth, and many fabrics were for farm families' self-use. Plus, after the Australians came, a large amount of Foreign Cloth was imported. The cloth shops in Guangzhou city had long since ceased to have local cloth. In remote county markets, there were still farm earth-cloth appearing, but with the chaos of war, it was unknown how many weaving households remained.

The Short-hairs provided a total of three schemes.

The first was the simplest, actually a variant of the putting-out dealer. Past putting-out dealers provided raw materials to peasant households, then bought and resold them after they were woven. The putting-out process also differed; some directly provided raw cotton or raw hemp, some provided spun yarn, and some large workshop owners produced and sold directly, but the looms were basically each family's or workshop's own. But the Short-hairs added "crediting machines" (leasing machines on credit). Besides putting-out for commodities, the Short-hairs would take another cut of profit for every bolt of cloth sold by those who obtained machines, and it was a permanent cut. This was much more ruthless than big households like them who gave credit for goods. Unless one bought back the "shares" in the Australians' hands, but the buyback price of those shares was more than ten times the direct selling price of the machines. Although the person being invested in could also accept Australian technical and management guidance, and the amount of the cut was determined by the amount of profit, it was basically selling oneself to the Australians.

As for the matter of corporate share dividends, in Wu Yijun's view, it was "East-West System" (Dongxi System) under a changed name. "East" was the money-owner (Caidong), "West" was the shopkeeper. The money-owner put up money, the shopkeeper managed; joint stock operation by several families was also a common thing. But actually, there were some differences. For example, this company that promoted him as the legal person was also to be invested in, but they didn't do specific business. He originally thought the Money Owner was that young False Short-hair, but contrary to his expectation, the one investing was not a person, but another company, and the shareholders of that company should be Real Short-hairs. Thinking it over carefully, he felt these Short-hairs were indeed worthy of being sea merchants; although it looked complicated, they could earn money while lying down.

Finally, there was one more model. That was for the merchant to fund the factory alone or in a partnership; the Australians only sold equipment and technology to the factory and didn't intervene in anything else. After paying taxes on profits, the rest could go into one's own pocket.

If asking which was best, naturally it was the third one. But the third one, it went without saying, required an investment that ordinary big households couldn't ask for. At least several families had to pool shares.

Returning to his residence, he ordered the family guards at the gate: "Move everything inside." The Short-hairs had distributed some samples to members interested in the cotton textile industry.

After returning to his study, he pondered for a while, then asked someone to call his cousin-nephew Chen Lin. Chen Lin was a relative of Wu Yijun in Nanhai County. His family was originally in silk workshops. Not long after the Australians fought over, there was a disturbance of bandits and soldiers in the countryside. The Chen family was first robbed, then suffered a fire disaster; the home was mostly destroyed. So he fled to Guangzhou to seek refuge with Wu Yijun.

Originally, after the four countrysides were pacified, Chen Lin was going to go back to pack up the family property. Unexpectedly, he later encountered the plague, and this delay kept him in the city.

A few days ago, Chen Lin had already come to bid farewell, saying he would leave Guangzhou to return to his hometown on a chosen date.

Looking at it this way, it was exactly a good opportunity.

Chen Lin came over to pay respects—he was a handsome man in his early thirties. He originally acted as a silk merchant in the countryside, his face tanned pitch black. Having stayed in Guangzhou for more than a year, he had become much fairer and looked like a scholar.

Wu Yijun exchanged a few polite words with him, asking how his luggage preparation was going and if the boat was hired firmly. He also instructed servants to prepare some local products of Guangzhou.

Only at the end did he speak of the main topic: "Your family has eaten the rice of the loom for generations. Come look at how these few pieces of cloth are?" He handed the few samples to Chen Lin.

Chen Lin took them, looked them over repeatedly, frowned, and said: "I wonder where Uncle got these cloth samples from."

"Don't worry about that for now, just look at how the quality and grade are?"

He responded with a sound of assent and said: "Nephew's family has consistently worked with silk. Although I understand a thing or two about cotton cloth, I am not an expert in this line and can only speak rashly."

Wu Yijun laughed: "If you don't understand, I understand even less. Just say what you understand."

Although he had the intention to do cotton spinning business, he always felt it was not quite appropriate. Because the cotton cloth competition in Guangzhou city was quite fierce. Whether it was local earth-cloth, fine cloth from Songjiang, or various cotton cloths from the Western Ocean, they all firmly occupied the market, and there was not much room in price. To really do it, the competitiveness would be very great.
