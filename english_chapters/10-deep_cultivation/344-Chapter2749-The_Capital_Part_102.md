# Chapter 2749: The Capital (Part 101)

At this moment, in a temple outside Zhangjiaawan Town, Xu Ke was racking his brain.

He had an important lead but couldn't extract anything from it.

As the special agent sent by the Foreign Intelligence Bureau for the Leng case, he'd led the Special Reconnaissance Team to Tianjin only to find Leng Ningyun already rescued. By rights, this was good news—saving him a lot of trouble and responsibility. But the subsequent instructions gave him a headache.

The Foreign Intelligence Bureau had given him a top directive from the Senate: based on the leads discovered in the Leng Ningyun kidnapping case, he was to dig out the masterminds behind it. They also reminded him this was very likely the "Stone Elder Group" they'd been tracking.

The Stone Elder Group's name was well-known among the Senators, but over the years of chasing them, they'd never captured any important figures. After arriving in Guangzhou, the already limited security forces were further diluted. Though they'd cracked many major cases, they hadn't caught any big fish and had accumulated quite a few unsolved cases.

Counting on fingers, from the "Lingao Disturbance" to the Witchcraft Case, the Tax Case, the Fake Medicine Case... all these cases showed traces of Stone Elder Group involvement.

The reason was simply that they had very little intelligence capacity in the capital. Though countless leads pointed to the Stone Elder Group being controlled by some powerful capital official, the intelligence work of Leng Ningyun and the Shanhai Five Routes in the capital was limited to collecting public information. First, operational security awareness in this timeline was very poor—public information and even rumors were enough to grasp many important situations. Second, the capital's surveillance was extremely tight—Eastern Depot, Brocade Guard, Shuntian Prefecture, Five City Garrison... various agencies overlapped and crisscrossed, with spies and secret agents everywhere. Collecting secret intelligence could easily backfire and affect normal business operations. The Shanhai Five Routes' main job was revenue. The Foreign Intelligence Bureau couldn't afford to deploy a second team in the capital. Only after the Mainland Campaign began did they set up a second professional intelligence team parallel to the Shanhai Five Routes.

With such weak forces, and the Stone Elder Group's time-transcending intelligence tradecraft, the Foreign Intelligence Bureau had failed to obtain useful leads in the capital.

The Leng Ningyun case had exposed too many useful leads. This was why, after seeing Min Zhanlian's squad's first batch of reports, Jiang Shan had immediately ordered elite personnel under Xu Ke's command to proceed to the capital.

After arriving in Tianjin, Xu Ke traveled day and night, reaching Zhangjiaawan on the first of the first month. Like Min Zhanlian, he chose this location as his command post.

The command post was located in Nie'ersi Village, less than ten *li* southeast of Zhangjiaawan Town. This area was a crucial canal transport route, as the saying went: "Boats reach Zhangjiaawan while rudders are at Li'ersi." The market was quite prosperous.

Here was a Daoist temple called Youmin Temple, located west of Nie'ersi Village on the south bank of the canal. It was a Daoist monastery housing a bronze statue of the Golden Flower Holy Mother, commonly called the Niangniang Temple. In the fourteenth year of Jiajing, Daoist Master Zhou Congshan petitioned and was granted the temple name "Youmin Temple."

The temple occupied elevated ground, covering more than ten *mu*, facing north with its rear to the south. Before the temple flowed the Grand Canal. It was a well-connected location. When Xu Ke passed through, he immediately designated it as his command post.

Such temples and monasteries often had rooms for rent. With silver, Xu Ke easily secured a courtyard, set up a radio station, and using a merchant cover, began intelligence collection work.

His arrival upgraded the equipment for all teams in the capital. Each team was equipped with compact radios and radio operators, plus walkie-talkies for reinforcement. Xu Ke could now remotely command multiple teams in simultaneous action from Zhangjiaawan.

Here, Xu Ke analyzed all acquired intelligence and reached several basic conclusions:

One, this was the Stone Elder Group's work. Two, the kidnapping's purpose was to force the Senate to negotiate peace. Three, the kidnappers had changed their minds during execution, switching to extortion for a huge sum. Four, Little Eunuch Yang was a major suspect.

Xu Ke realized this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. They not only knew the Stone Elder Group's mastermind was Wang Yehao, but had also discovered major leads on several core members. The fake Daoist captured by Min Zhanlian's squad had great potential for extraction. At the time, with rescue being urgent, Min Zhanlian's squad hadn't questioned him carefully. Now Xu Ke had time, a location, and professional personnel—he could thoroughly interrogate this fake Daoist inside and out.

Though he had the Political Security Bureau's best interrogators, he felt they only knew "technique." Using torture for confession was quick and convenient but inevitably had biases. This Liu Sha had initially chosen to confess, showing his mental defenses were broken. Working slowly would yield more information.

Unfortunately, when Liu Sha was transferred to him, he was barely alive. Xu Ke could only have the accompanying medic give him good food and care. Though Liu Sha's wounds hadn't hit vital points, he'd lost a lot of blood. After wound suturing, infection set in. Days of high fever, though treated with antibiotics, had left even this robust man near death. Never mind interrogation—even answering questions was extremely difficult.

Fortunately, with no urgent matters in the capital, there was no rush. While Liu Sha recovered, Xu Ke began arranging plans to destroy the Stone Elder Group.

Previously they knew nothing about the group; now they knew the leader. However, while assassinating Wang Yehao would be simple, he was a court official. If he died suddenly, the court would certainly investigate. Moreover, from current information, Wang was just the behind-the-scenes financier. The actual commander was someone else.

This person or group was not only crafty but well-versed in old-timeline knowledge, understanding the Senate more deeply than anyone except the Hale Group. Xu Ke and nearly all the Senators in the security agencies believed this group very likely contained someone like Hale from the old timeline.

Their primary target wasn't Wang Yehao but this "Hale-Like." Though the Senate had never issued a specific order, the Senators in the security agencies had an unspoken understanding.

Xu Ke dispatched three key surveillance teams. One focused on Wang Yehao. One covered Eunuch Yang and Little Eunuch Yang. The third covered Manager Shen of Xia's Shanxi House.

As for other relevant persons with leads discovered in the Leng Ningyun case investigation, he also assigned surveillance personnel for round-the-clock monitoring and intelligence collection. However, besides discovering some conspiracies to run on Delong, there were no useful leads yet.

"How's Liu Sha's condition?" he asked the medic.

"His temperature came down this morning, but he'll probably have a low fever again this afternoon. No more danger."

"Is he conscious?"

"Yes. He even asked if I was a Short-Hair."

Xu Ke laughed. "Tell the guards to watch him carefully. Watch for suicide attempts."

"He's in restraints with a mouth gag. He won't die."

"Get him more qi-tonifying and blood-nourishing herbs. His food needs to improve too. Don't skimp on money." Xu Ke said. "This man is a treasure right now."

After the medic left, the communications officer brought reports from the various teams. Delong had been open for three days now. The run was over, and customer flow had returned to normal.

A few little tricks, and it worked. Xu Ke thought with some satisfaction.

As for Wang Yehao, the priority surveillance target, there was no significant news. He behaved like any ordinary capital bureaucrat—going to office daily, making calls, meeting people, attending banquets... nothing unusual. He met many people, and with the surveillance team's limited manpower, they couldn't investigate everyone. So it was quite difficult. Xu Ke could only focus surveillance on Wang Yehao's key servants and secretaries.

Even with priorities, the surveillance team was still stretched thin. An official of Wang Yehao's rank had two or three dozen secretaries alone—some living in his residence, some lodging elsewhere and visiting every few days. As for household servants, besides the steward and purchasing agents, there were over a dozen runners regularly handling his affairs. The analysis group, screening collected intelligence, had produced a priority surveillance list of over a dozen people.

Through monitoring these people, Xu Ke learned that Wang Yehao was currently sending people to search for Wang Liang and Liu Sha—including in Tongzhou. They'd also found Liu Sha's residence—where they could only find bloodstains, of course. But this confirmed the authenticity of Liu Sha's confession.

Surveillance also revealed that Wang Yehao frequently met with other ministers and had many contacts with the Wen Tiren faction. They seemed to be discussing something important. Combined with Liu Sha's confession, this was probably about "peace negotiations."

Clearly, after Leng Ningyun's rescue, the hostage-based peace negotiation plan had failed. But Wang Yehao hadn't given up, still trying to bring about negotiations.

"If he actually pulls it off, that might not be bad." Xu Ke thought. But try as he might, he couldn't figure out how Wang Yehao would convince the Emperor or how specifically to proceed.

With the Emperor showing intent to "exterminate the Short-Hairs" at this critical juncture, Wang Yehao advocating for peace showed strategic vision surpassing many ministers.

However, thinking of the "Mr. Yue" Leng Ningyun mentioned, Xu Ke increasingly felt that "Mr. Yue" was very likely Wang Yehao's principal advisor—and very possibly the Hale-Like he was searching for.

But this "Mr. Yue" was quite mysterious. No one among the Wang residence's secretaries and servants mentioned anyone surnamed "Yue." Obviously, this was an alias.

The portrait hand-drawn by the National Police Headquarters technical department based on Leng Ningyun's description was still somewhere at sea. But of all the secretary photos taken so far, none showed this person.

Apparently, Wang Yehao and this person had no direct daily contact, probably communicating through some secret channel. Xu Ke thought: This has the flavor of modern intelligence work. This Mr. Yue isn't simple.

He had commanded many intelligence collection and special operations in Ming-controlled territories. The level of clandestine activity in the 17th century was very low. Even secret societies and cults couldn't do much better. As long as they had local guides, they could easily collect important intelligence.
