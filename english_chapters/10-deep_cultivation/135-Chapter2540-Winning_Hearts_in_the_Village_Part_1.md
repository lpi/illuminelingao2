# Chapter 2540: Winning Hearts in the Village (Part 1)

The textile internship group was busy with their respective work, and Uncle and Nephew Chen also had their work. Chen Ding was busy inspecting the sand fields bought by Wu Yijun in Nansha and other places, urging and checking the tenants' cotton planting status. Chen Lin stayed in the village—he now faced a major challenge: winning the support of clan members.

Originally, this was not a difficult task. Chen Lin was the eldest grandson of the eldest branch of the clan. In terms of status, he was naturally a candidate for clan leader. When he reached middle age and grew a beard, becoming a clan elder or clan leader were expected things. Moreover, for many years, his father managed the silk workshop for the whole clan. Many benefits in the clan came from this silk workshop. Many clan members regarded his family with favor.

But now, the situation had changed. Second Uncle relied on the chaotic situation to usurp the position of Head of Case and snatched away the silk workshop—the key was that he also received the support of the Australians. Clan members were mostly fence-sitters. His father was gone; whether they still recognized him as the "eldest grandson of the eldest branch" was still a question mark.

Fortunately, after returning this time, Chen Xiaobing specially took him to see Li Yao'er, and the two sides had a conversation. Although Li Yao'er didn't promise him anything explicitly, the implication was that she wouldn't mix into their grudges as long as they "did the work well."

To open a factory in Nansha, he had to pull the clan members over. But he was empty-handed now; what he had was only the "future." Clan members weren't stupid. Although Second Uncle did many unpopular things, since he occupied the workshop, he could take out many benefits to buy off clan members. Compared to Second Uncle's ready-made benefits, who would believe the empty check on his side?

He thought for a long time in the graveyard. Naturally, once the construction of the textile factory started, clan members could gain benefits from it, and it wouldn't be hard to win them over.

However, the urgent task was to form his own force in Nansha. Now Second Uncle relied on the militia composed of people with foreign surnames to suppress the dissatisfaction of clan members. He could use the matter of building the textile factory to unite clan members and form a "Second Force."

In the past, he dared not directly confront Second Uncle—after all, Senator Li's attitude was ambiguous. Now Senator Li's opinion was clear, and he had the backing of Chen Xiaobing and Senators Li and Zou. He definitely could fight Second Uncle head-on!

If he didn't take back the clan power, he feared it would be difficult to move a single step in the village in the future!

Fortunately, he had an advantage, which was his good popularity in the village in the past. Many young disciples in the clan had good relationships with him. If he used means to win them over, he should be able to gather a group of people.

Of course, he couldn't blatantly say this was the "Second Militia" he wanted to create, but he could totally use the method of "recruitment training" to recruit young people—this was content already in the original plan.

He calculated in his heart. Besides Chen Qing, he had seven other "diehard" clan youngsters in the village. First rope these eight people in hand, and the subsequent things would be easy to handle.

Not long after returning to the village, he used the reason of needing someone to serve him to call Chen Qing back to his side as a servant. At night, he asked about Second Uncle's movements during this period.

Ah Qing shook his head and said, "Ninth Uncle, Second Granduncle actually did nothing these days. He rarely even went to the ancestral hall. Apart from going to Chief Li to answer the roll call every day, he ignored everything else. He also often went to the county seat to drink flower wine."

"If he doesn't serve Chief Li, who handles the various things handed down by the Chief? He is also the Baojia of this village."

"He entrusted all these things to Mr. Lu."

Chen Lin frowned slightly. He knew Mr. Lu. Originally the accountant of the silk workshop. Later, because the clan member managing accounts in the ancestral hall had unclear silver and money, clan members all had opinions and no one trusted people from their own family, so they hired this person with a foreign surname as the accountant of the ancestral hall. He calculated accounts fast, was clear in logic, and was quite upright, so clan members trusted him.

Mr. Lu had been in Nansha for more than ten years, and his relationship with Chen clan members was "pale as water." The reason was self-evident; if he was too intimate with a certain person, there would inevitably be problems of "personal favoritism," affecting his credibility here. So for these years, his errand in Nansha had always been steady.

*Looks hard to handle!* He thought. Although Mr. Lu was upright and definitely looked down on Second Uncle's various styles, he had always been prudent and absolutely refused to mix into intra-clan struggles. He adhered to the principle of "support whoever is on stage" to do his own errand well. As long as Second Uncle was still the Clan Head of Case and Shopkeeper, he would definitely listen to Second Uncle's orders. Unless he had the ability to abolish Second Uncle's position.

"Did anything else happen in the village recently?"

"Nothing really happened..." Chen Qing blinked.

"Any matter is fine."

"The Kun person brought by Second Granduncle stole a chicken from Zhang the Dyer of the silk workshop and made a scene. The dyer was punched. He went to complain to Second Granduncle but was slapped in the face by him instead. The dyer got angry and sick, hiding at home and not going to work."

"Zhang the Dyer? Is that Lame Zhang?" Chen Lin seemed to have an impression. Many workers in the workshop were not Chen clan members. In his impression, Lame Zhang was a dyer with good craftsmanship but was fond of gambling. In his early years, he gambled excessively and owed a butt-load of debt. His leg was beaten lame by the creditor. Chen Lin's father helped him pay the debt and made him sign a contract to work for the workshop until the debt within the clan was paid off.

Pity this Zhang the Dyer found it hard to change bad habits. He still didn't stop gambling these years. The result was that he always owed money to the clan, tantamount to working for the silk workshop for a lifetime.

"Exactly. Now the master is sick. Several apprentices in the dyeing room are clumsy in work, producing mostly defective goods. Silk cloth has piled up. Second Granduncle slammed the table and cursed, telling the militia to carry Lame Zhang over to make him work. But when carried over, they saw he still couldn't work. Second Granduncle was so angry he told people to take a carrying pole to beat him... Finally, Mr. Lu dissuaded him. Second Granduncle had to send people to load the silk cloth onto boats and ship it out to dye."

"Ship it out to dye? Isn't this smashing the workshop's signboard?"

Although Lame Zhang was no good as a person, his cloth dyeing skill was first-class, with dye recipes mixed over many years. The effect dyed was unique, famous in the county and even Guangzhou. Switching to a dyeing workshop to dye might not be noticed by laymen, but insiders would know at a glance.

"Mr. Lu said so too, but Second Granduncle said he couldn't wait anymore; otherwise, delaying delivery would mean paying compensation."

"Hehe, doing this, people in the village probably all have complaints."

"How is it not so?" Chen Qing lowered his voice. "Ninth Uncle, people in the village say this whatever Kun person stealing chickens—it wasn't any Kun person at all, but done by Qiu Xiao under Second Granduncle, that Scabby Head. Because Second Granduncle wanted to shield him, he deliberately let out word that it was done by Australians."

"I'll go see Lame Zhang tonight. Ah Qing, work hard these few nights to gather a few youngsters in the clan—I don't know who is available; I have a plan."

"Okay, I'll go do it after dinner!"

After dinner, Chen Lin also quietly set off for Lame Zhang's house.

Lame Zhang was not a Chen family member. His residence was relatively remote. Thanks to this, it was very convenient for Chen Lin to go from the graveyard. Crossing a few field ridges, he saw seven or eight thatched cottages at the river branch. Living here were all people with foreign surnames making a living in Nansha Village. Either tenant farming for the Chen family or working.

Lame Zhang worked in the silk workshop and originally had a very good income. But his bad habits made his house the most dilapidated among these few. The small courtyard didn't even have a door, just a standard wicker gate.

Entering the courtyard, he saw Lame Zhang's wife spinning yarn in the small courtyard by the light of the sky. Because Nansha had much sandy land suitable for planting cotton, many families grew cotton.

Although Lame Zhang loved gambling, he at least had a bottom line: wife and house didn't go on the gambling table. But this was just talk. He owed gambling debts more than once. If the Chen family hadn't helped him manage, his wife and house would have been taken away long ago.

"Sister-in-law Zhang!" Chen Lin greeted.

Seeing it was Chen Lin, Sister-in-law Zhang hurriedly stood up and curtsied.

"How is Uncle Zhang now?" Chen Lin didn't have the heart to be polite with her and asked.

"How else can he be? Lying in the room sulking." Sister-in-law Zhang smiled bitterly.

"So the illness is mostly better."

"What illness does he have? He just angered himself!" Sister-in-law Zhang continued spinning, chattering, "I said haven't you been beaten enough in this life? Before, you owed gambling debts and were hung on the tree at the village entrance with pants stripped off and whipped. You endured such embarrassing things. Now getting a punch and a few slaps makes you angry, even saying you quit—if you quit, what will you eat!"

Chen Lin originally wanted to perfunctorily say a few sentences and go in. He didn't expect Sister-in-law Zhang's words obviously contained something. He wasn't in a hurry to go in now. Let's hear what Sister-in-law Zhang says.

"Unexpectedly, this old thing spoke forcefully, saying when Master Xuan came back to be the shopkeeper of the silk workshop, he said this workshop was the Chen family's in the past but belongs to everyone now. No one is allowed to bully people relying on being a Chen clan member... " Sister-in-law Zhang sighed, "I told him this Master Xuan was just saying pretty words; you actually believed it! Besides, this Master Xuan wasn't any good..." Speaking of this, she braked hurriedly and accompanied a smile, "Look at me talking nonsense again! Should slap my mouth!"

Chen Lin secretly laughed that Lame Zhang, at his age, actually believed such nonsense. No wonder he always lost everything gambling. He hurriedly said, "Sister-in-law, you are sensible! I think you are much stronger than Uncle Zhang! Second Uncle was indeed rash this time. I apologize to you for him first!"

After speaking, he lifted the grass curtain and entered the room. The room was dim. Borrowing the light from outside, he could see Lame Zhang was not lying on the bamboo couch but sitting alone on a broken bamboo chair.

His left eye had a purple patch, swollen so much he couldn't open it. The right eye was also bruised. This appearance indeed made it impossible to work in the dyeing room.

Chen Lin laughed, "Uncle Zhang, is your body better? Really sorry to you this time."

Hearing Chen Lin's voice, Lame Zhang barely opened his eyes, hurriedly stood up from the bamboo chair, and said with some resentment and helplessness: "Ninth Master, don't be like this; this small old man can't bear it."
