# Chapter 2777: The Capital (Part 129)

In recent years, he had been secretly collecting "black material" on the Restoration Society, preparing for a fatal blow. Wen Tiren knew that what the Emperor tabooed most was "forming cliques."

When the Emperor first ascended the throne, in order to exclude the Eunuch Party, he employed people outside the Donglin Party, and later alienated the Donglin. The reason was that he detested ministers forming parties, not just the "Eunuch Party." After eradicating the Wei Zhongxian clique, the problem of the Donglin Party gradually became prominent, attracting Chongzhen's attention. He turned his gaze to those "Solitary Ministers" without party backgrounds. And gradually excluded Donglin Party members from the cabinet center.

After excluding the Donglin Party, the Emperor did not re-employ members of the Eunuch Party either. In the choice of cabinet members, he was more inclined to choose those ministers without obvious partisan colors. Zhou Yanru and Wen Tiren entering the cabinet had a lot to do with them being "Partyless" in the Emperor's eyes. Naturally, whether they were partyless or not, only Heaven knew.

Zhou Yanru wanting to use the power of the Donglin and Restoration Society to return to the cabinet was something that had to be prevented no matter what. This was not just a problem of power distribution, but that once Zhou Yanru returned to the cabinet, the Donglin would inevitably settle the old scores of his attacks on Qian Longxi and Yuan Chonghuan back then.

As for the "Conquering the Kun" and "Opening the Port" mentioned during the summons today, they were not on his mind instead.

The most important thing for him right now was to counterattack the Donglin and the Restoration Society.

Wen Tiren was extremely formidable in attacking political enemies. Unlike other political figures, he never engaged in public opinion offensives like "impeachment memorials falling like snow." This was useful for some emperors, but for Chongzhen who detested "forming cliques," too many and too concentrated impeachments against a certain person would only arouse his suspicion—if it wasn't forming a clique, how could there be so many people rising up to attack him in a swarm?

A very important reason why Wen Tiren could stand firm was that the Donglin Party's methods did not adapt to the Emperor's thinking mode. Wen Tiren did the opposite. To squeeze out a person, he would patiently wait for the opportunity. When this person made a mistake, he would then go up and drop stones down the well. He wouldn't act unless he was sure, but once he acted, he would often put the opponent to death. Ever since he attacked Yuan Chonghuan and brought down Qian Longxi, he had rarely missed when punishing opponents.

This was the so-called "plotting according to the matter, letting the mechanism trigger itself, so the Superior does not suspect." Sometimes he would pretend to be magnanimous and say good words for a person, but actually link this person to the things the Emperor tabooed, making the Emperor even angrier, thereby aggravating the punishment for this person. This was the so-called "openly saving but secretly harming." If he wanted to recommend a person, he would secretly instruct someone to propose it, and he himself would express his opinion again. In short, no matter what he did, he acted from the dark and never showed his face personally.

His train of thought for dealing with the Restoration Society was also like this. Although he didn't act, he always instructed his younger brother to pay attention to whether there were anti-Restoration Society figures in secret. Last year, the attacks of Lu Wensheng and Zhou Zhikui on the Restoration Society gave Wen Tiren an excellent opportunity.

If Zhou Zhikui opposed the Restoration Society because of different past political views and later "loss of office," Lu Wensheng's attack contained elements of local gentry fighting for power and profit.

This Lu Wensheng was also a native of Taicang. Although he had no degree (merit), he was also from a gentry background. When young, at his maternal grandfather Zhou Wenqian's house, Zhang Cai was his classmate. In the ninth year of Chongzhen, the two fell out over a trivial matter. Lu Wensheng thus held a grudge in his heart. Wanting to wait for an opportunity to retaliate against Zhang Cai, he came up with the idea of going to the Capital to sue the Restoration Society.

Naturally, going to the Capital to sue over such a big matter, targeting the "Restoration Society" whose reputation was like the sun in the midday sky, a "White Body" (commoner) like Lu Wensheng dared not make the decision unauthorizedly. Naturally, there was a "Big Shot" backing him behind the scenes.

This big shot was not Wen Tiren. It was Wang Shimin, a prominent family in Taicang. This Master Wang was a descendant of Wang Xijue, the Senior Grand Secretary of the Grand Secretariat during the Wanli reign. He had a "friendship of two generations" with Wen Tiren and was heavily relied upon by Wen Tiren, receiving favor and courtesy especially thicker than other trusted aides.

At that time, the prominent families in Taicang were the Wang Shizhen family (Minister of Justice in Wanli) and the Wang Xijue family (Senior Grand Secretary in Wanli). After Zhang Pu founded the Restoration Society, his school flourished, and many disciples of prominent families lived under his tuition. Wang Shimin thus harbored resentment against the Restoration Society. Lu Wensheng saw this point exactly, so he came to the door and told him of his intention to enter the Capital.

Wang Shimin said: "Minister (Wen Tiren) dislikes the Restoration Society. impeaching them fits the opportunity exactly. But the Minister is strict and does not see people lightly. The one in charge is only Deqing (Cai Yichen), you should discuss it with him." Lu Wensheng then visited Cai Yichen in the Capital according to his instructions and presented the draft memorial.

Wen Tiren read the draft memorial sent by Cai Yichen and thought Zhang Cai was insignificant, so he instructed Lu Wensheng to turn the attack target to Zhang Pu, and to attack Zhang Pu from the angle of "using the pretext of raising provisions to state treachery and abuses one by one."

But this opportunity was offset by the influence of the Restoration Society. The Education Censor Ni Yuangong responsible for investigating this case, and the successors Qi Wei and Zhang Fenghe, either protected the Restoration Society or delayed the case. During this period, the Restoration Society used the connections of its members to transfer Lu Wensheng to be a clerical official in Yongzhou Prefecture, Hunan, using the method of giving a "Good Position Vacancy." The intention of Wen's trusted aide Cai Yichen to lure him to submit a memorial again completely went bankrupt.

Wen Tiren was not discouraged because he still had a card in his hand, which was Zhou Zhikui, the first one to come out against the Restoration Society. For this, he specially dispatched his partisan Cai Yichen to Fuzhou to persuade him to submit a memorial again.

According to the letter, Zhou Zhikui was already on the way to the Capital and would arrive in the Capital in a few days.

This was his first move. The second move was to deal with Qian Qianyi. Eliminate this head figure of the Donglin. With both measures applied simultaneously, Qian and Zhang were the heads of the Donglin and Restoration Society. Inevitably, there were many interactions between the two, which must include discussions on the Imperial Court and some political operations. Moreover, according to the news he obtained, Zhou Yanru intended to rise again, and Qian Qianyi was also one of the operators.

If he could link these three people together, the hat of "Forming a Clique to Disorder Government" would be worn solidly. Once a major prison case was instigated, even if they could escape with their lives, they would have no future in politics to speak of.

Wen Tiren's calculation was extremely shrewd, and from beginning to end, he himself had no figure involved. The Emperor would definitely not think of the tricks behind this case.

"Wen Tiren will definitely be dismissed in June of this year?" Wang Yehao asked in a low voice.

"It is written like this in the Book from Heaven." Zhou Lezhi said, "Master also said so, it's correct."

"Looking at his appearance, the Emperor still trusts him very much!"

Even though the Book from Heaven had successfully predicted many major events, regarding such a major court event, Wang Yehao was still somewhat apprehensive. Because the predictions of court situations and world events in this Book from Heaven gradually became no longer accurate in recent years. Regarding this problem, Zhou Lezhi naturally couldn't solve it because he could only read the "Book from Heaven." As for his master, he would only mutter some crazy words like "Butterfly," "Caribbean," and "Typhoon," and Master Wang was too lazy to ask more.

Wang Yehao and Zhou Lezhi's meeting today was conducted secretly. Zhou Lezhi had warned him that there must be many eyes of the Kun thieves around the Wang residence. Their meeting must be extremely confidential; otherwise, his Zhou Lezhi's little life would not be preserved.

If Zhou Lezhi kicked the bucket, the "Book from Heaven" would become a stack of waste paper. Wang Yehao, dignified with the title of Minister of War and Vice Minister of War, also had to act accordingly. Master Wang disguised himself today, mixed among the merchants entering and leaving the residence to leave home, and changed his attire once on the way. Only then did he come to this secret location to talk with Zhou Lezhi face to face.

Regarding the court situation, Zhou Lezhi's judgment was naturally inferior to Wang Yehao, so he did not express an opinion.

"Never mind, this matter has nothing to do with us. We are happy to sit and watch." Wang Yehao said, "It's just that today's court discussion seems to imply war. In the Emperor's heart, presumably, the idea is still to seek peace through war."

"War or no war, it doesn't matter much. Just don't let the Imperial Court lose its vitality." Zhou Lezhi sighed, "If this battle is fought, I'm afraid Zuo Kunshan (Zuo Liangyu) will engage in heavy losses of soldiers and generals! Zhonglun (Xiong Wencan) doesn't have many soldiers in hand. If he wants to conquer the Kun, nine out of ten he will issue a call to transfer Zuo Shuai's troops..."

"Hehe," Wang Yehao laughed coldly, "Zhonglun only hangs a title of Governor of Southern Gan. How can he command that bunch of arrogant soldiers and fierce generals in the Central Plains? Zuo Kunshan has always been arrogant and self-indulgent. With Zhonglun commanding this time, just not losing too ugly would be an excellent outcome!"

He saw Zhou Lezhi was somewhat lost and said: "Sir need not be too concerned. Instead, regarding the matter of opening the port you mentioned..."

Immediately he recounted everyone's words during the cabinet summons today.

"...Wucheng (Wen Tiren) spoke not without reason. Shanghai is a coastal heavy town in the Southern Zhili. Digressing to open it as a port was indeed reckless!"

Zhou Lezhi pondered for a moment and said: "No matter how many sea ships the gentry run, that is a private matter and cannot be put on the table. To pass the clear road (make it official), it will be difficult! Alas!"

"Regarding Qian Taichong..."

"It doesn't matter." Zhou Lezhi said, "If Shanghai won't do, we can change to Ningbo."

"Ningbo?" Wang Yehao was quite familiar with Ningbo, not only because he was from Zhejiang, but regarding the matter of opening a port, he had rummaged through many old materials. Ningbo's port geographical environment was superior to Moon Port, and it had the prosperous Jiangnan region as its hinterland. In terms of transportation, although there was no Yangtze River water transport to utilize like Shanghai, utilizing the Yong River could also reach Hangzhou directly, connecting with the Grand Canal. In water transport, it could equally enjoy the benefit of extending in all directions.

"I'm afraid this matter is also difficult..." Wang Yehao shook his head and said, "Since the opening of the seas in the Longqing reign, Zhejiang officials have petitioned three times to open the Zhejiang Sea, and the Imperial Court rejected them all."

"That was one time, this is another time." Zhou Lezhi said, "In the Jiajing and Wanli reigns, the world was peaceful. Opening a port to extract tax was nothing more than icing on the cake for the Imperial Court. People in the center naturally preferred one less thing to one more thing. Now the world is in turmoil, and what the Imperial Court lacks most is silver. Could it be that the Zhejiang gentry will just watch helplessly as the Merchants Bureau earns silver?"

Although there were many Jiangsu and Zhejiang gentry participating in shares in the Merchants Bureau, most of them belonged to the Restoration Society group, and the gentry from the four prefectures of Suzhou, Songjiang, Huzhou, and Hangzhou were the most numerous. The gentry from various prefectures biased towards the south were much fewer.

This part of the people were the potential supporters of opening the sea in Ningbo. If they were willing to be active, there was still hope for this matter. Moreover, currently, the court discussed "Conquering the Kun." The gentry of the Merchants Bureau who used to turn a blind eye to the Kun thieves to earn money probably also wanted to cut ties and "pass the clear road" to feel at ease.
