# Chapter 2775: The Capital (Part 127)

If this person returned, the first one he would deal with would be himself... to be precise, if Zhou Yanru wanted to return, the Donglin-Restoration Society group would first have to eradicate him...

As soon as he thought of this, Wen Tiren felt thorns in his back. This matter must be resolved as soon as possible!

How to resolve it? Zhou Yanru's reputation was very bad, with numerous misdeeds while in court. In his hometown, People even wanted to dig up his ancestral grave. But relying on these alone was not enough to ruin the Emperor's impression of him; after all, these were considered "minor details."

Wen Tiren had been an official for many years and knew deeply that "Sacred Favor" was extremely changeable. The Senior Grand Secretary stood right at the cusp of the wind and waves; a slight carelessness would make him the target of public accusation.

He need to eliminate the threat as soon as possible.

In that instant, he had already formed a killing intent.

Before he could continue thinking, the Emperor arrived.

Today, the Emperor's complexion was looking a little better than in previous days, no longer dull and lusterless. The cabinet ministers knew that the situation had been stable recently, and the Emperor's mood was probably much better.

After the sovereign and ministers exchanged greetings, the Emperor took his seat on the throne. Although he had a strange dream last night, he slept very soundly afterward. Getting up today, he felt his spirit was much better than in the past. Ever since Consort Tian offered Nanyang fruits every night, he felt more energetic than before—he didn't know if it was the effect of this fruit.

Regarding the efficacy of this fruit, the Imperial Physicians also had a controversy because they had never seen it before and couldn't say anything definite. Whether it caused "internal heat" or "dispelled heat" was debated endlessly. Chongzhen was very annoyed and simply dismissed the Imperial Physicians' opinions.

Seeing that the Emperor had no specific agenda, Wen Tiren selected some more urgent matters from recent reports to report. The Emperor had read the "Tie Huang" (Yellow Slip/Summary) for most reports and didn't need to read them in detail; they could be directly drafted (Piao Ni) by the Grand Secretariat and handed to the Directorate of Ceremonial for the "Red Batch" (final approval). Only a few important military and national affairs needed the Grand Secretariat's advice. In form, it was still "Sage's Sole Discretion."

Chongzhen ascended the throne at a young age and hadn't received complete imperial education and training. The handling of specific government affairs was actually based mainly on the suggestions of the cabinet ministers. Wen Tiren was best at figuring out the Emperor's intentions and was good at practical affairs, so his responses often conformed to the Emperor's mind. As for the other cabinet ministers, most were Wen Tiren's partisans and rarely offered contrary opinions. Thus, the court's political affairs were mostly decided by his hand alone.

Wen Tiren decided cabinet affairs alone, regarding his colleagues as wooden puppets and controlling the power of drafting rescripts. The Emperor didn't think it strange but felt he was "Loyal in Isolation." Therefore, people at the time said the Emperor had "Caught the Plague" (a pun on Wen's surname).

When the government affairs discussion reached a pause, the Emperor slowly opened his mouth and said: "The Kun thieves have been rampant for a long time and have already captured the land of two provinces. The Imperial Court can actually do nothing about them. Do you gentlemen have any strategies to cure this trouble?"

Since the Kun thieves raided Guangzhou, "Kun Thieves" had also ascended to the agenda of the Imperial Court's military and national affairs, frequently mentioned in major and minor court assemblies.

Speaking of the momentum of the Kun thieves, it was actually much greater than the Eastern Barbarians (Manchus) or the Roving Bandits. To date, the Eastern Barbarians had only taken the Liaodong Regional Military Commission and the old lands of Guangning. Not to mention not taking an inch of land inside the Pass, even the strategic passes outside the Pass like Jinzhou were still under the Imperial Court's control. The Roving Bandits were as fast as a raging fire but were suppressed as quickly as they rose, scurrying everywhere. Although they had once captured the Central Capital (Fengyang) and caused great destruction, they had never been able to occupy prefectures and counties for long.

Only these Kun thieves, in just two years, had taken the land of two provinces (Guangdong and Guangxi). Since the founding of the Great Ming, except for abandoning Annam (Vietnam), there had never been such a "loss of territory."

In these years, court deliberations on the matter of punishing the Kun thieves had occurred more than once, but they never got to the point. There were too many places needing troops and money. Compared to Guangdong and Guangxi on the southern frontier, thousands of miles from the Capital, the Eastern Barbarians who had breached the Pass several times and the Roving Bandits who had been charging left and right in the Central Plains heartland seemed much more "imminent" threats.

Therefore, from the Emperor down to the officials, except for some officials of Guangdong origin, most did not pay much attention to the matter of "Conquering the Kun." Moreover, the strong mysterious aura on the Kun thieves made it impossible for officials to make suggestions. When the Imperial Court solicited strategies for suppressing the Kun from the officials back then, many memorials of all kinds came in, and among them, there were quite a few absurd and laughable ones.

Some said the Kun thieves' cannons were sharp and used for siege. If the spirit tablets of the ancestors of the Zhao Song Dynasty were hung on the city gates, since they claimed to be descendants of Zhao Song, presumably they wouldn't be such ruler-less and father-less generation, and these Kun thieves would definitely not dare to open fire on the spirit tablets of the Zhao Song ancestors. Others suggested sending people to the Song Emperors' tombs to destroy the Feng Shui and scatter the Kingly Qi. Still, others said the Kun thieves claimed to be descendants of the Great Song, but their official documents and notices never had the seal of the Great Song; there was news saying they were rebellious subjects of the Australian Song (Ao Song), so an envoy could be sent to find the location of Ao Song and ask the Ao Song Emperor to send troops to jointly exterminate the Kun thieves.

This matter dragged on amidst indecision. regarding Jiangxi, Guizhou, Fujian, and other places, either by Imperial Court decree or by the governors' own initiative, some "Anti-Kun preparations" were done more or less—building camps, casting new cannons, replenishing troop quotas... But compared to the Guan-Ning Army gathering at Shanhai Pass, these preparations were merely a single hair from nine oxen.

Now the Kun thieves were considered "quiet." Why did the Emperor suddenly ask about this?

The group of ministers was yes-men. Before the Emperor set the tone, they dared not speak recklessly.

Wen Tiren, however, knew the Emperor's mind. previously, the Emperor had hinted many times in his words about "Pacification." regarding whether to negotiate peace with the Kun thieves, Wen Tiren felt it didn't matter one way or the other. If the Emperor wished for peace, he personally would absolutely not oppose it. But he knew the Emperor's temper deeply and also knew the direction of public opinion in the court. The two words "Peace Talk" were about the same as "Selling the Country for Glory." The Emperor refused to bear the reputation of "Peace Talk" and wanted the cabinet ministers to make the suggestion.

Actually, the cabinet ministers all knew this bit of thought, but none of them was willing to make a sound. Because the Emperor cherished his feathers (reputation) extremely. In case the peace talks failed or the news leaked out, the Emperor wouldn't take the blame for them.

Seeing everyone remaining silent, Chongzhen asked directly: "Mr. Liu?"

Liu Yuliang was the second-ranked person among the cabinet ministers. Hearing Chongzhen's question, he responded carefully at once: "The Kun thieves claim to be descendants of Zhao Song and overseas loyalists, but they have short hair and short clothes, practicing the way of changing the Xia (Chinese) with the Yi (Barbarian). Nominally loyalists, they are actually barbarians. These Kun thieves mostly come from the south and are not accustomed to the northern climate and water and soil. Although they are a near worry, they are not a great calamity. This humble official believes the current plan should prioritize suppressing the Roving Bandits."

These words could be called watertight. He didn't talk about "suppression," nor "pacification," only saying "suppress Roving Bandits first," which catered to the "Pacify the Interior" policy proposed by the Emperor not long ago. Even if the Emperor was picky, he couldn't find any fault.

Sure enough, Chongzhen showed dissatisfaction upon hearing this but didn't say much. He turned his gaze to Xue Guoguan.

This man, Xue Guoguan, was "sinister and harsh, unlearned and lacking literary talent," and had always had no stance to speak of. In the Tianqi reign, he served as a Supervising Secretary of the Office of Scrutiny for Revenue, attaching himself to Wei Zhongxian and impeaching Donglin officials. In the early Chongzhen reign, he impeached the remnants of Wei Zhongxian's party, criticized by the court opinion, and had to resign under the name of caring for his parents to avoid the limelight. He was only reinstated in the third year of Chongzhen. His entry into the Grand Secretariat relied entirely on Wen Tiren's recommendation, and he was also one of Wen's partisans.

Seeing the Emperor ask him, he had already thought of a countermeasure. He said: "Since the Kun thieves claim to be descendants of the Great Song, regardless of whether it is true or false, their heart of yearning for China is visible. Although they do not submit to the Kingly Transformation now, we have never heard of them usurping titles or proclaiming systems; regarding the officials of the Imperial Court who fell to them, they mostly sent them out of the border with courtesy. The captured Imperial Clansmen were also mostly treated well. Presumably, they are not arrogant and rude people..."

Speaking of this, he quietly observed the Emperor's face. Seeing the Emperor showed no displeasure, he emboldened himself to continue: "The Kun thieves know shame. Presumably, they are different from the Eastern Barbarians and Roving Bandits. If we can enlighten them with loyalty, faith, benevolence, and righteousness, they are not stubborn stones."

These words were a step further than Xue Guoguan's*, but the window paper still wasn't poked open. Next, the words spoken by everyone were largely identical with minor differences, going around in circles, all meaning "Pacification," but refusing to say the word "Pacification."

*Translator's Note: The text says "a step further than Xue Guoguan's" but Xue Guoguan is the one speaking. It likely means "a step further than Liu Yuliang's".

The Emperor felt a bit impatient and turned his gaze to Wen Tiren again.

Wen Tiren said: "The matter of the Kun thieves should only be planned slowly, not rushed. Your subject believes we should inform the new Governor of Southern Gan, ordering him to train troops and prepare for war, select more spies to gather news, to prepare for the Imperial Court's future suppression advancement."

Everyone was saying "moderate" words, but he alone sang a different tune, causing everyone to be stunned. Then they heard him say: "Since the Kun thieves raised their troops, rumors say they are invincible, inevitably making them arrogant from top to bottom. If we do not blunt their sharp edge and display the might of our Celestial Dynasty, I fear it will be difficult for them to appreciate what loyalty and righteousness are..."

Wen Tiren's words were somewhat baffling. But the Emperor understood his meaning. For these astute people, figuring out the Emperor's wish wasn't hard, but figuring out the Emperor's specific intended method depended on each person's cultivation.

Chongzhen nodded slightly. Although he didn't receive a clear suggestion for "Pacification," at least the cabinet ministers had a "consensus." And what Wen Tiren just said fit his mind very well. As for the specific handling, he didn't want the cabinet ministers to know everything. After all, this wasn't a glorious thing.

"Recently, a minister reported that since Guangzhou has fallen and Moon Port (Yuegang) has been abandoned, maritime trade is cut off. He requested to open Shanghai in the Southern Zhili as a port, allowing Chinese and foreign merchants to trade at the port, re-establishing the Supervisorate of Merchant Shipping, and measuring ships to collect taxes. It is estimated to obtain two hundred thousand taels of silver annually to supplement the source of provisions. What do you gentlemen think?"

Strictly speaking, 17th-century China only had two foreign trade ports: one was Guangzhou, and the other was Moon Port. Guangzhou was the "Old Precedent," and since the Portuguese were the trade middlemen, it meant little to Chinese maritime merchants; most maritime merchants sailed to countries in the East and West Oceans through the port of Moon Port.

The management models and trade forms of the two ports were different, so they were divided into the "Guangzhou Case" and the "Moon Port Case" (Precedents). However, whichever case it was, the taxes collected had a strong local color. It wasn't until Wanli sent eunuchs everywhere to serve as Tax Supervisors that maritime trade tax revenue became part of the Emperor's Inner Palace income.

But these two types of precedents had many restrictions on maritime merchants, so Moon Port trade gradually declined at the end of the Tianqi reign and shifted to Anping under Zheng Zhilong's control. Neither the central court nor the local government actually lost the maritime trade tax revenue of the Fujian port*.

*Translator's Note: The text says "actually lost" (qishi dou shiqu le). It means they *did* lose the revenue because it went to Zheng.
