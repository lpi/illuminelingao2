# Chapter 2489: Stripping the Cocoon (Part 4)

It was the bright springtime of March. Liang Yuanfu walked on the street, sweat constantly dripping from his forehead, making his fat face look shiny and oily. He timed his outing precisely; staying even one minute longer posed a risk. Therefore, he had to walk fast, and simply trotted in quiet places. He moved quickly through the streets and alleys, stopping occasionally to observe his surroundings like a frightened rabbit—panicked, tense, sensitive, and suspicious. After passing a few alley entrances, Liang Yuanfu turned into a small alley. In front of a house in the alley, a tall and thin man in his thirties with a wretched appearance saw him coming. He bowed, smiling fawningly, and came up to welcome him. First, he bowed deeply, then came up to pat the dust off Liang Yuanfu's robe, saying: "Steward Liang, your old self arrived a bit later than usual. Tired, right? Come, come, freshly made herbal tea. Come inside quickly to drink a couple of mouthfuls and cool down."

Liang Yuanfu didn't answer, going straight into the main room. He took a teacup from the table himself and gulped down three cups of herbal tea in a row before feeling a bit more refreshed. He collapsed onto a chair to catch his breath slightly, saying to the tall, thin man who followed him into the room: "Yu Laosan, it's not like you don't know. The Liang family's household is strict. Since the Australians entered the city, control has been even tighter. The outer and inner courtyards are locked day and night. Without the residence's wake-up pass, no servents of any rank are allowed to leave without permission. As an inner courtyard steward, I cannot leave even for a moment. How many errands inside and outside are waiting for me to attend to?"

After speaking, he sighed and said: "Alas, my old mother is seriously ill at home. Searching for good doctors everywhere yielded no results. My younger brothers and sisters were helpless, only saying to beg you for some Australian miracle medicine. Hmph, yet you don't give face, only making excuses. My younger brother had no choice but to beg at the residence for me to come out to visit the sick. The master is kind-hearted; moved by my brother's sincerity and filial piety, he allowed a period of one month. You also know, since Young Master Liang's relationship with the Australians cooled, if anyone in the residence is found privately communicating with Australians, the light punishment is a beating with bamboo planks upon capture. The heavy punishment is expulsion from the family registry, with all silver, houses, and land bestowed by the Liang residence stripped away, leaving with nothing but one's body. This is really forced by lack of options; otherwise, who would come looking for you?"

After finishing, he asked urgently: "Yu the Third, do you have the stuff?"

Seeing him ask, Yu Laosan switched to a grimacing face, saying with difficulty: "Steward Liang, your old self also knows, this Australian miracle medicine is the hardest to get. Even Runshi Hall and the Provincial-Port General Hospital are always out of stock. As for other families, you can't even see a hair of it. This malaria medicine you seek is even rarer. The quota for this in all of Guangzhou is insufficient. I am just a idler messing around in the lower nine streams; where would I have such ability?"

Hearing this, Liang Yuanfu couldn't help but feel angry inside. He raged: "Speaking all this bullshit to perfunctorily deal with the master! If you don't have the stuff, why did you agree to meet me? To amuse yourself with me? Besides, who doesn't know that you, Sky-Drilling Monkey Yu Laosan, can connect to the nine heavens above and the nine hells below? Originally, under the Great Ming, various departments of the government office couldn't catch you. Now you've hooked up with the Australians. It's rumored throughout Guangzhou city that only you have the connections to get this Australian miracle medicine. I won't chatter idly with you; you just name a price, and I definitely won't treat you unfairly. If you make excuses again, a big ear slap will come your way."

Yu Laosan's eyes rolled, and he giggled, saying: "Steward Liang, calm your anger. You are, after all, a figure from a big threshold; this generosity is indeed different, extremely decent. But I am truly powerless in this matter. Besides, the Old Madam's cold and heat disease might not necessarily be treated correctly. Ordinary quack doctors can hardly understand these Australian medical principles and pharmacology. Using medicine recklessly might cause problems. By coincidence, I know someone with real ability, addressed as Mr. Wang in Guangzhou city. He truly has hands and eyes reaching heaven. Not only can he get miracle medicine, but even inviting Australian medical officers or being admitted to the Australian Imperial Hospital might be possible."

Hearing this, Liang Yuanfu widened his eyes and said, "Really? Can you introduce..." He hesitated halfway through his words and said: "This person wouldn't happen to have any entanglements with the Australians, right?"

Yu Laosan couldn't help but sneer: "Steward Liang, you want to eat fish but don't want to get fishy; where in the world is there such a cheap deal! Besides, this Guangzhou Prefecture is now the world of the Australian Song. Which matter doesn't touch the Australians? Your old self has good fortune; today it just so happens Mr. Wang came to find me for business. Your old self please sit comfortably; wait a moment, and it will be clear."

Hearing this, Liang Yuanfu felt uneasy inside. He hesitated, standing up wanting to leave, but was reluctant to walk away, holding onto a shred of hope. Just as he paced into the courtyard, undecided whether to advance or retreat, he heard a knock on the door from outside. Yu Laosan laughed "Hehe" and said: "Guangzhou's ground is wicked; speak of the devil and he arrives." After speaking, he walked quickly out and opened the courtyard door. A small two-person sedan chair was carried in, swaying tremblingly. Two attendants followed closely beside the sedan chair; one look and you could tell they were capable men. When the small sedan chair landed, the front poles touched the ground, and the bearers flashed to the left. An attendant beside the sedan lifted the curtain, and a man of about thirty walked out. This person wore a square scarf on his head and a blue scholar's robe. Under his jaw were three strands of long beard. With a square face and a magnificent build, he truly had a fine appearance; seeing him seemed to take one's breath away.

Yu Laosan hurried forward a few steps to bow, then stood on tiptoe to whisper a few words in that person's ear. That person nodded slightly, didn't speak, and strode straight into the main hall.

A sedan bearer casually closed and bolted the courtyard door. The few accompanying men scattered and stood around, seemingly casually, yet they completely sealed off all exits of the small courtyard.

Liang Yuanfu gradually felt something was wrong. He looked at the person in the room with a face full of suspicion, then turned his face to look at Yu Laosan.

Yu Laosan welcomed him with a smile, making a vague gesture, and said: "Steward Liang, please. This is Mr. Wang. Your matter rests entirely on his old self."

Liang Yuanfu walked into the room hesitantly and sat apprehensively to the right of that person, stealing glances at him from time to time.

After taking his seat, Xu Tong, alias Mr. Wang, was in no hurry to speak to Liang Yuanfu. Instead, he nodded to Yu Laosan and said: "Second Brother, change a pot of hot tea. Use the leaves I gave you last time."

Yu Laosan didn't reply, going to fetch the pot himself. Not long after, he brewed a pot of hot tea, poured for the two in the room, retreated to stand outside the door, and gently closed it.

Xu Tong smiled faintly and said: "Steward Liang, this is famous Australian Song tea, Cloudy Mica Mountain Oolong. The aftertaste is the most lingering. Please."

Liang Yuanfu carefully picked up the teacup and took a sip. His mouth felt bitter; drinking it tasted like chewing wax, and he tasted absolutely nothing.

Looking at the inner courtyard steward of the Liang residence who was out of his wits before him, Xu Tong knew he was taking a desperate gamble today. Yang Cao had given a death order to find a way to "pull someone out" and develop an insider. He had to take a risk.

If he failed today, losing a potential development target would be one thing, but the consequences of alerting the enemy were even harder to predict. He could imagine what that cloud-puffing woman would say to him if he failed, and how she would write the report.

But this risk still had to be taken.

Xu Tong took a sip of tea and slowly said: "Second Brother told me everything. The matter isn't too difficult, yet not easy either. Success or failure depends entirely on Steward Liang's intent."

Hearing this, Liang Yuanfu immediately put down the teacup, stood up, bowed, and said: "My mother is seriously ill, shivering with cold and burning with fever all night every day. As a son, seeing this is painful like a knife twisting. My brothers have invited all famous doctors in Guangzhou city, all helpless. If Mr. Wang truly has this connection and can find the Australian Song Imperial Hospital's miracle malaria medicine, this humble one will definitely repay the kindness. Wealth, goods, fields, and land—nothing will be refused. I hope Mr. Wang understands the pure filial heart of my brothers."

Xu Tong said: "Money is a small matter; Steward Liang need not worry about it. As long as Steward Liang is willing to do me a small favor, Wang will naturally do his best regarding the Old Madam's matter."

Liang Yuanfu's heart immediately hung in suspense, having a trace of ominous premonition. He said: "I wonder what the matter is?"

Xu Tong said: "You just need to tell me the important internal information of the Liang family."

Hearing this, Liang Yuanfu's heart pounded violently. He took a vigilant step back and said: "Does Mr. Wang want me to be a spy? Although I come from a servant background and practice a lowly trade, I recognize the two words 'Loyalty' and 'Righteousness.' The Liang residence's grace to my Liang family is as deep as the sea. My Liang family absolutely cannot do such a thing as selling out the master for glory. If my mother knew of this, she would definitely not agree to betray the master to seek treatment and would surely forgive me. Mr. Wang, act as if Liang never mentioned the words just now. Farewell."

Finishing his words, he lifted his foot to walk out the door. Just as he pushed open the door, Yu Laosan stepped sideways, blocking his path, and said: "Where is Steward Liang going?" Liang Yuanfu, fierce in appearance but faint in heart, said: "Yu Laosan, you dare stop me? What do you want to do? How can the bright world of Guangzhou Prefecture allow you lot to act wildly!"

Yu Laosan smiled without humor and said: "Steward Liang, since you haven't concluded the talk with Mr. Wang, how can you just shake your hands and leave? You should at least talk it out to a conclusion; it won't be too late to leave then."

Liang Yuanfu intended to force his way out, but saw the four attendants and sedan bearers slowly gathering around, encircling him in the center. One of them slowly lifted the corner of his robe, revealing a curved handle at his waist. Liang Yuanfu, having walked the streets for a long time, immediately recognized it as an Australian six-shot revolver.

Liang Yuanfu's heart turned icy cold. He immediately knew these people were likely the Australians' Jinyiwei. Standing stiffly for a long while, helpless, he had to return to the main room and sit back down to Xu Tong's right.

Xu Tong seemed not to have driven the scene just now. He just sat steadily, holding the covered tea bowl, gently skimming the floating leaves in the cup with the lid, took a sip along the rim, and slowly said: "The Liang residence has multiplied in Guangzhou for more than ten generations. Steward Liang's family has succeeded father to son as inner courtyard stewards for four generations, right? By your generation, it should be the fifth. Steward Liang must be the type known as a household-born lad. Back then, your great-great-grandfather was originally surnamed Liu; he only changed his name to Liang after selling himself into the Liang residence, right?"

Liang Yuanfu just lowered his head silently, showing no reaction.

Xu Tong didn't mind and continued: "The Liang residence, a scholarly family, has repeatedly produced talents, with many serving as officials. Steward Liang's family, attached like a fly to the tail of a steed, bullied the weak to grab benefits for yourselves—these things happened, right? Although your Liang family are servants in the Liang residence, once outside, you count as local tyrants. Leaning on the Liang residence and relying on official power, accumulating the prestige of four generations, you set up a residence and bought land in the countryside, using slaves and maids, acting unscrupulously. You should count as a tyrant bullying the neighborhood."
