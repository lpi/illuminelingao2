# Chapter 2699: The Capital (Part 51)

"Yes, Mr. Zhou often says, do not complicate simple matters."

At present, Jieyi was only temporarily out of favor; she hadn't lost hope yet. If another woman was brought in, the Zhou family's situation would become comprehensively complicated. In case the newcomer was even more capable of making trouble and Jieyi was completely left out in the cold, when trouble broke out later, it would be even harder to clean up.

Wang Yehao's gaze stayed on his face for a long time, saying: "Spoken not bad. You have also improved nowadays!"

"All depends on Master's cultivation!"

"I know it; you just go."

He and Wang Yehao didn't expect that such a household affair would actually brew into a huge transformation later.

This boudoir farce counted as calming down under Zhou Lezhi's all-out mediation. After some days, Jieyi also ended her exiled life. Under Master Wang's personal appearance to mediate, she kowtowed to admit fault to Mr. Zhou, and this matter counted as passed. Naturally, from now on Jieyi dared not mention "entering the door first is senior" anymore, and could only submit beneath Yourong.

Mr. Zhou also temporarily abandoned the idea of getting a few more women to enrich the rear house. Obviously, this matter gave him a very good lesson: the rear harem is not always harmonious, and he didn't possess the power of "suppressive authority."

Zhou Lezhi felt the Teacher was actually the "conflicted" person. He clearly could be a "Master," yet insisted on embodying that he stressed "everyone is equal."

With the household restless plus the Shorn-hair Thieves being strong, Hearthstone Daoist's outings reduced significantly. Although he didn't nest in Zhaoqing completely, occasionally traveling to and from the Jiangnan region, especially the "Farm" in Dongyang, the main time was used on writing books and teaching Zhou Lezhi.

Now, he rarely taught specific learning, more often shaping his "Worldview"—this term was also taught to him by the Teacher.

"Australian learning is deep like the ocean; even I only have a drop of water. What I can teach you probably doesn't even count as a water molecule..." The Teacher sighed with emotion, "The only thing I can teach you is the method of thinking."

...

He glanced at a bamboo chest in the room. Inside were some manuscripts he recently wrote, written based on the learning taught by the Teacher.

The Teacher's writings were now all stored in the Dongyang Farm. Now they were still Zhou Lezhi's most precious wealth. These years he was busy fighting with Shorn-hair Thieves and had no time to teach disciples, so he could only write out the knowledge Master taught back then and his own understanding when he had free time.

Every time he thought of the Teacher's various schemes, how could he not know that his comparison with Shorn-hair Thieves was just a mantis trying to stop a chariot. "Knowing it cannot be done but doing it anyway."

He remembered words the Teacher had said: Although the fall of Great Ming was the trend of the times and nothing to pity, he wasn't willing for Shorn-hair Thieves to win too easily.

"Shorn-hair Thieves came here carrying technology crossing eras, bullying the weak with strength. Acting unscrupulously, regarding common people as straw dogs. If letting them get the country easily, do common people have a road to live in the future?"

Speaking to here, he sighed lightly: "I know, this burden is a bit heavy for you; doing or not doing lies entirely with you. I absolutely won't blame..."

"If you are willing to shoulder this burden, come to my room tomorrow night at the second watch. I will pass all the secrets on the 'Heavenly Book' to you. It's just once you know, I fear you can never place yourself outside matters again, nor can you pass the rest of your life peacefully."

...

This burden now fell onto his body.

Zhou Lezhi sighed a long sigh. Staring at the solitary lamp like a bean in the room—the current Great Ming, according to the Master's words, had reached the point where oil was exhausted and lamp was drying up. Even without Shorn-hair Thieves, the lifespan left wasn't much. To raise campaign and expedition at this time, once defeated, the consequence wasn't as simple as losing army and lost territory. The Roving Bandits of the Central Plains, the Jianzhou Captives of Liaodong, would all enter by exploiting the emptiness. The Jiangshan and Sheji [State] of Great Ming, fear was in imminent danger.

Kidnapping Senator Leng, speaking of it, was also their small clique's desperate wager. Laughable that Master Wang still thought of manipulating vertically and horizontally up to now, using this to control the Court situation, dreaming the confusing dream of entering the Cabinet to become Minister and assisting Great Ming.

"Sir." A greeting called his thoughts back from memory to reality.

"What matter?"

"Daoist Jinshi [Jin/Gold Stone] is here."

"Invite him in."

Jin Wenchi's face carried a slight look of worry. Kidnapping Leng Yuning [Cold Cloud Coagulation/Condensation?] was an act of walking on danger. In case of losing control, the Stone Old Man clique would very likely suffer hundred-fold retaliation from this—just look at the Zheng family's end back then to know.

"Daoist Master..."

"Sit."

Jin Wenchi was one of the Stone Old Man clique's main "Pen-guts" [Advisors], his status in the clique second only to Zhou Lezhi who inherited the identity of "Hearthstone Immortal."

He was different from the Liu family brothers—those two were somewhat unconvinced by Zhou Lezhi "inheriting the name"—after all, Zhou Lezhi was too young. But Jin Wenchi was different. Before Zhou Lezhi "inherited the name," he had cooperated with this youth to handle matters and had quite a few dialogues, knowing his vision and depth were hard to compare for ordinary people. Although in learning he was far inferior to his Master, his shrewd depth and decisive yet cautious handling of affairs were above the Master.

"Daoist Master, news came from outside; Shorn-hair Thieves in the capital are mobilizing various troops and horses to search for Bandit Leng's whereabouts. With their ability, it won't take long to find clues... Should we quickly move the place."

"The place storing goods shouldn't move; moving leaves traces. They didn't find it at the start; finding it now isn't easy either. Now they search for people with great momentum just to force us to transfer, so as to reveal flaws."

"But... in case they find it? Should we send more manpower?"

"So many people gathered in one place will be discovered sooner or later." He pondered for a moment and said, "Manpower shouldn't be added anymore; instead, we can use a route of suspect troops [decoy]." Speaking so, he explained his ideas one by one.

"...See if it works?"

"Works is works, only this route of suspect troops fear might draw fire to burn oneself; must be people who have no relation with us."

"Let the Liu brothers worry about this; they can handle it."

"Daoist Master..." Jin Wenchi still had no intention to leave, saying again.

"What does Sir say?"

"Sir's goal is to force Shorn-hair Thieves to negotiate peace. If Shorn-hair Thieves insist on going their own way?"

"Mr. Zhou told us back then, Shorn-hair Thieves' Senators are incomparably noble. Shorn-hair Thieves will absolutely not risk placing a Senator in death ground."

"No matter how noble, it's just the rank of a Prince of Great Ming. In this Dynasty's Tumu Crisis, Yingzong hunted in the north [was captured], the Court also didn't necessarily negotiate peace with Oirats. Shorn-hair Thieves are heard to have as many as five or six hundred Senators; concerning national policy, how can they submit easily?"

"Sir, on this you don't know." Zhou Lezhi shook his head, "Shorn-hair Thieves' Senators are not 'Princes,' but 'Parliament Members' [Assemblymen]"—he knew it was hard to explain what Parliament Member and Parliament meant, what Aristocratic Republic meant; after all, when the Teacher taught him initially, he also treated it as Arabian Nights [Fantasy].

Seeing Mr. Jin's confused eyes, he thought and said: "That is to say, a Senator is actually an Emperor... En, every Senator has the power to discuss politics. If a colleague falls into danger and the power-holding Bandit Wen and Bandit Ma etc. don't save with full force, they also cannot continue to hold government."

"So they simply must save."

"Exactly so."

"But Sir, now the wind direction of the Court is to campaign against Shorn-hair Thieves. We say want to negotiate peace, here the Court wants to send troops; how to win trust?"

"The Court wanting to send troops naturally has unavoidable points. Even the Emperor inevitably has times he cannot help himself."

Regarding this matter, actually Wang Yehao saw clearer than them all. Although the Emperor's Mind Techniques couldn't be spoken too clearly, one point beyond doubt was that the Emperor proposing the Southern Expedition itself contained components of three hearts and two minds [indecision]. As for the ministers in the Court, they viewed it even less favorably.

Whether "Pro-War Faction" or "Pro-Peace Faction," probably all realized the Southern Expedition couldn't solve the Shorn-hair Thief problem. "Discussing Suppression" or "Discussing Appeasement" were essentially just excuses for political struggle in the court hall.

"Could it be..." Jin Wenchi was slightly surprised.

"Exactly so." Zhou Lezhi lowered his voice, "If negotiating appeasement without a fight, where is the Court's face? So this battle must be fought. It's just you and I both know, once weapons rise, those suffering are common people. The Court's strength will also be consumed in vain—now Great Ming is deficient in both Qi and Blood, and can no longer withstand greater losses..."

"Student understands!" Jin Wenchi nodded, "No wonder inside private circles court ministers mostly say to appease, but on the court hall they speak generously and passionately saying to suppress."

"Court ministers or the Emperor alike, all have difficulties." Zhou Lezhi sighed, "If we can take Leng Ningyun as hostage, forcing Shorn-hair Thieves to proactively negotiate peace, dodging this war disaster, the Great Cause can then be planned slowly."

"Everything takes preserving vitality as priority."

"Exactly so." Zhou Lezhi said, "Turning spears and halberds into jade and silk; if we can live peacefully with Shorn-hair Thieves, the national momentum might even turn for the better by one or two."

"If the Emperor doesn't allow, what then?"

"This matter will rely on the Master to manipulate vertically and horizontally. What the Emperor dreads most is actually Court Discussion. As long as the Court Discussion all says appeasing Thieves is great benevolent government, he naturally will follow good advice like a flow..."

"So that's how it is!" Jin Wenchi nodded repeatedly, praising: "Although Sir is young, towards the Court situation it is observing fire like watching fire [clear], penetrating to the inside. Loss that I was Lord Wei's advisor for more than ten years!"

"Lord Wei is a person holding public justice and appointing straightness; handling affairs rigid and straight. Sir being his advisor, naturally wouldn't and disdained these tricks." Zhou Lezhi said, "It's just the current world, to do upright matters, requires plotting tricks of demons and ghosts. Otherwise don't speak of accomplishing things, even self-preservation is hard!"

These words not only excused their various actions but indirectly flattered Jin Wenchi, making him very comfortable. Busily humble: "Where, where, Student is just dragging out existence in the world!"

"How is Miss Wei's side?"

"She sent back a message, saying the Hengshan Sect lost many disciples since the Lingao Campaign; now it's hard to send manpower again. Forcing the difficulty, they can only send three or four people."

"What about other various sects?"

"Also agreed to send people, just all similar to Hengshan Sect. Two or three, three or four people only."

"Able to send people is good." Zhou Lezhi said, "Was silver given?"

"Liu Zhao already allocated it over."
