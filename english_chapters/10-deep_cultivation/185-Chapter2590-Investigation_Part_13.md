# Chapter 2590 - Investigation (Part 13)

"Work on the accounts here. If you need anything, just call the assistant. He'll be waiting outside. Don't wander around without reason. There are many valuable medicinal materials here—we don't want any confusion later." Manager Gao said.

"Yes, yes, I understand!"

After Manager Gao left, Yuan Shuzhi opened the ledgers. These were basically customer transaction accounts—nothing difficult. However, Yuan Shuzhi had only obtained a certificate; he was still rather unfamiliar with actual bookkeeping. But lacking other skills, the rote memorization abilities drilled into him through years of imperial examination preparation were still first-rate. Regardless of practical application, he could follow procedures to organize various data items, then fill in entries one by one.

As for making the accounts reflect "reasonable tax avoidance"—that required some practical application, and the boundaries were difficult to grasp. Fortunately, Yuan Shuzhi was only here to blend in, not actually intending to do this job. He'd roughly follow the unproblematic items and scales mentioned in the training class.

This ledger corresponded to a small customer. The customer had no formal business name, only written as "Boluo Qiu's." Yuan Shuzhi knew this was almost certainly a medicine peddler—such people had no fixed shop name, so the ledger simply noted "so-and-so place, so-and-so's" as identification.

From the ledger, this "Boluo Qiu's" purchased large amounts of goods from Jubao Tang every month. The types of goods were quite limited—basically only three items: "Poison-Dispelling Pills," "Lushi Powder," and "Pain-Relief Pills." Mixed in were also some "Zhuge Marching Powder," "Plague-Warding Powder," and such medicines. The back also noted the producing brands. For example, Marching Powder was mostly marked "Runshi Tang." Obviously, this Jubao Tang was doing a resale wholesale business—distributing famous Chinese patent medicines from major out-of-town pharmacies to small medicine peddlers.

Lushi Powder caught his attention. But Boluo's Wanchun Quan was originally the source of Lushi Powder, so he couldn't infer whether this stuff was related to the fake medicines outside.

He couldn't worry about all that for now. Yuan Shuzhi spent an afternoon organizing the basic accounts. Afterward, the assistant outside took the ledgers away and brought tea and snacks.

Yuan Shuzhi was eating the snacks and drinking tea when he wanted to use the latrine. He asked the assistant where the outhouse was. The assistant said he'd escort him there. Yuan Shuzhi waved him off: "No need, no need. Just tell me where it is..."

Unexpectedly, the assistant wouldn't take no for an answer. He insisted on accompanying Yuan Shuzhi to the latrine and even waited outside. When Yuan Shuzhi came out, the assistant escorted him back to the accounts room.

Yuan Shuzhi, cramped from sitting in the room, wanted to go out for a walk. But the moment he reached the veranda, the assistant blocked him again.

"It's windy outside. Sir should stay in the room. Otherwise, you might catch cold."

Hearing this, Yuan Shuzhi knew Jubao Tang had secrets. He withdrew with an awkward smile, but his heart began pounding.

Having come to the medicine market, though he'd already sent a secret letter to the investigation team in Boluo through Qiwei's mail service, apart from registration information at the inn, nobody knew his whereabouts. If he encountered any danger, his cries for help would fall on deaf ears!

At this thought, his heart clenched.

The only option now was to take things one step at a time, doing his best to appear obedient and honest.

After another half-hour or so, Manager Gao reappeared in the room and praised: "Sir, your accounts are well done. Worthy of someone from Guangzhou!" With that, he produced a five-qian silver coin from his sleeve and handed it over. "This is today's payment."

"Th-thank you!" Yuan Shuzhi immediately put on an expression of overwhelming joy, quickly accepted it, and stuffed it into his pocket.

A slight smile appeared at the corner of Manager Gao's mouth. "Today's work is done. Please come back early tomorrow morning. There are many more ledgers to enter."

Yuan Shuzhi was startled. According to traditional commercial employment, whether accountant or clerk, once hired, one usually lived in the shop. Even locals could only go home during holidays, and most couldn't freely go out.

But he didn't dare ask more and agreed immediately. Regardless of whether Jubao Tang had secrets, half a day's work for a five-qian silver coin was quite generous.

Yuan Shuzhi returned to his room at the Qiwei inn, pondering today's business. Jubao Tang's manner was indeed somewhat suspicious, but thinking carefully, nothing seemed particularly special.

In Huizhou, Zheng Xiaoyu had smoothly "fallen into corruption," established a "deep friendship" with Huizhou's "Bailing Tang" pharmacy owner, and began using his official powers to arrange the "Joint Clinic" matter.

The Senate's so-called "Joint Clinic" meant introducing Australian-style diagnostics and medicines into local traditional Chinese medicine clinics or pharmacy consultation services—similar to the "integrated Chinese and Western medicine" approach.

For ordinary people and pharmacy owners, the most valuable part of this designation wasn't "Australian diagnostics" but "Australian miracle drugs." Because establishing a Joint Clinic meant obtaining Australian drug "prescription rights"—being able to write prescriptions for various Australian medicines.

Though clinics couldn't stock drugs themselves and patients still had to take prescriptions to specialized pharmacies, without a prescription, no amount of money could buy the medicine. Thus, prescription rights alone were already priceless.

Of course, establishing such a "Joint Clinic" first required holding a "medical practice license" issued by the Senate Health Ministry. The minimum standard for such a license was one year of training at the Health Ministry's training program with passing evaluation. With this license, one could work at various hospitals and clinics under the Health Ministry, or independently open a clinic.

The problem was that while many could pass training and evaluation, the Senate's own medical institutions didn't have enough staff. Waiting for allocation to Joint Clinics would take a very long time. This Boss He of "Bailing Tang" was quite farsighted, having sent his son to Guangzhou for training early on. The problem was distant water couldn't quench immediate thirst. It would be another year before his son graduated—how much money would he miss earning in that year!

This was the biggest obstacle before Boss He. Since Zheng Xiaoyu had "fallen by imperial decree" and accepted twenty percent dry shares in the future "Joint Clinic," he naturally needed to help solve this roadblock quickly.

Getting Boss He's son a physician license immediately was impossible. The only solution was to immediately find someone with a license to fill the gap.

Zheng Xiaoyu didn't know the old-timeline practice called "license hanging," but he'd figured out this trick on his own. He himself had a practice certificate, of course, but still had administrative duties and couldn't hang his out. So he drafted an application stating that to strengthen Huizhou Prefecture's medical and health level, he was specially requesting permission for a certain naturalized citizen medical worker from the former Huizhou Health Station to provide consultations at "Bailing Tang" Joint Clinic every Thursday and Saturday, better serving local residents' health needs, and so on.

The application reached Zheng Mingjiang, who naturally approved with a flourish of her pen. Thus "Bailing Tang's" Joint Clinic smoothly opened—taking less than half a month from start to finish. Boss He couldn't stop grinning.

Zheng Xiaoyu's smooth "fall into corruption" indeed attracted attention from local pharmaceutical colleagues. Invitation cards poured in daily. Zheng Xiaoyu never declined, clinking glasses freely, cultivating his image as "greedy and lustful" in Huizhou while waiting for the "big fish" to take the bait.

Before the "big fish" bit, Yuan Shuzhi made progress on his end. After doing the owner's accounts for several days straight, he finally officially joined Jubao Tang as a full-time bookkeeper.

But even as bookkeeper, he still hadn't seen Jubao Tang's owner. The one who came was still Manager Gao.

Manager Gao said the owner had reviewed his accounts, found them good, and asked if he was willing to formally join Jubao Tang. The salary was generous—five yuan per month.

Hearing this, Yuan Shuzhi immediately put on the appearance of a "stray dog finding a master's shelter," expressing tearful gratitude and willing acceptance.

"Since that's the case, move in tomorrow." Manager Gao said.

"Yes, yes. I'll go pack my things right now and move in tomorrow."

"When you check out from Qiwei, you'll need to write your 'destination.' Just write 'returning to Guangzhou.' Understand?"

"Oh, yes." Yuan Shuzhi's heart tightened, but he put on a puzzled and naive expression as he agreed.

"Don't be suspicious." Manager Gao seemed worried he'd be suspicious and explained: "My business here is exclusive. Many people are watching, wanting a piece of the pie. So keeping one's mouth shut is most important. You've been coming and going here for several days—surely some have noticed. Writing 'returning to Guangzhou' saves you trouble and saves the shop trouble."

"Yes, I understand."

After moving into the shop, his duties remained the same—daily registering and organizing old ledgers. But this time, Manager Gao made specific demands: the ledgers needed to be "reasonably improved."

Yuan Shuzhi had already noticed the ledgers were unreasonable during his first few days of bookkeeping.

Jubao Tang's customers were almost all small medicine peddlers without formal business names like "Boluo Qiu's." The medicines they distributed rarely exceeded five or six types, with "Poison-Dispelling Pills," "Lushi Powder," and "Pain-Relief Pills" being the largest volumes. Other medicines were just occasional additions.

This completely defied common sense. Such peddlers typically practiced medicine while selling drugs, carrying at least a dozen types—sometimes thirty to fifty. The more variety, the better it showcased their capabilities. None would stock only three or four items.

Even stranger: medicine peddlers' purchases emphasized small quantities but many varieties. Because drugs sold wholesale couldn't be returned. Items that didn't sell well meant losing money. So they wouldn't buy much of any single item. Even for items that sold well, they wouldn't over-purchase to avoid tying up too much capital—after all, it was small-scale business.
