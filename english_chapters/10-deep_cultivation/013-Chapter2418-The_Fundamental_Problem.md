# Chapter 2418: The Fundamental Problem

"Speaking of suffering so bad that people starve to death, there isn't any," Chen Lin said. "But the common people's days are much worse than before."

As long as the people of Nansha Village were surnamed Chen, their days were originally pretty good. Even the poorest families could eat their fill and have clothes to wear. When sick, the clan managed medicine; when dead, the clan provided a coffin. During ancestral worship and New Year, they could even get a few pieces of ancestral pork.

For the tenant farmers, weavers, and long-term laborers who weren't surnamed Chen, life naturally wasn't so comfortable, but at least they could scrape by and survive.

But on this trip back, although only a few days had passed, the lives of the people around Nansha were very hard.

The looting by soldiers and bandits was certainly the main reason, but his Second Uncle could also be called an accomplice who made waves.

However, he dared not say these words to this female Senator. One obvious thing was that this Li Yao'er trusted Second Uncle very much, and this trust was not "trust from being deceived." Second Uncle's actions as the local Baojia were obviously favored by the Australians.

In these few days since returning, Chen Lin had already learned much of the situation from his sister and Chen Qing's family where he was staying.

Since Nansha formally came under Australian jurisdiction in April 1635, Chen Xuan, relying on a chance encounter during his flight and years of social experience honed in "mixed society" fawning skills, had pleased the Australian Chief he met so much that he was "overjoyed." Before long, he became the "Liaison Officer" in Nansha, then assumed the position of Nansha "Baojia"—that is, the village chief.

Originally, his holding power was not very popular. Whether clansmen or villagers, all looked down upon this former "prodigal son" and "local ruffian." Many elders had even declared that Chen Xuan being Baojia was "the biggest joke under heaven." If he was only dealing with the Australians on behalf of the village, the village and clan could tolerate it, but if he really wanted to meddle in clan affairs, they would open the Ancestral Hall and expel him from the clan, and wouldn't even allow him to live in Nansha.

Unexpectedly, this Chen Xuan was also quite a ruthless character with methods of his own. Shortly after arriving in Nansha to take up the Baojia position, he organized all the outsiders from other surnames and other places—the long and short-term laborers and hired workers who were originally at the bottom of the village—into a militia unit. He also specially selected four brawny strangers who were big and strong, had come to Nansha for only a short time, and had no connections, to be his bodyguards. Each carried a *Pudao* (broadsword). Usually they stood guard at the village office, and followed as attendants when going out to handle matters. Whoever dared to talk back to Chen Xuan got a stick beating. No matter which branch or which generation of clansman, all were beaten bloody.

As a result, whether clan or village, no one dared to offend Chen Xuan's "official authority" anymore. Let alone expelling him from the clan—instead, they were forced to let him become the Ancestral Hall Manager, managing all the clan's property and affairs. Even the Ancestral Hall was openly occupied by him to use as the village office.

Chen Xuan was well aware that his power in Nansha all depended on the Australians. Since becoming Baojia, he could be called "enthusiastic" about the various affairs arranged by the Australians. Whether it was collecting "Reasonable Burden" taxes, dispatching corvée, or "public security rectification"... all the various tasks assigned down from the Xiangshan County Government were carried out with full effort. In just a few months, Nansha Village in Xiangshan County became a "Model Village" known even to Chief Wen.

Being a Model Village naturally came at a price. Especially when the Senate began to fall into a security war in Guangdong, a large number of National Army troops were organized in Guangzhou, and their provisions and pay, besides being transported from Lingao, many came from the counties under the original Guangzhou Prefecture.

Besides grain requisitions, logistics supply transport also involved large amounts of manpower and boats, which were also apportioned to each county and village through "corvée dispatch."

The land tax burden in Guangdong under Great Ming rule was very light, accounting for only 2.01% of the national land tax burden. Although it had gone through the Three Surcharges levy plus local various surcharges, for powerful local clans like the Chen family who controlled the grassroots and had considerable influence on the county, it wasn't too great a burden.

But for the Senate, Guangdong's taxes were really too light. According to the opinion of Director Wang and others, Guangdong's current land tax had "very great potential" and was worth "deep mining." This "Reasonable Burden" was not so "reasonable" for the Chen clansmen of Nansha and smacked somewhat of extortion.

This wasn't to say the Chen family was deliberately crying poor. After all, the soldiers and bandits had wreaked great havoc on Nansha, causing the Chen family's many years of accumulation, whether public or private, to suffer heavy losses. Now facing the expenses of Reasonable Burden and corvée dispatch, they couldn't help but be strapped.

In the past, many government burdens, especially corvée burdens, were transferred to the outsiders in the village. But now outsiders held power and advocated "equal dispatch of corvée." The Chen family had the most male laborers, so the corvée they got was naturally more.

Whether it was "Reasonable Burden" or the frequent "corvée dispatch," they naturally affected agricultural production in Nansha. Added to this were widespread rumors that the Australians wanted to implement "375 Rent Reduction" and "Progressive Taxation," making the Chen clansmen all like startled birds, unwilling to put effort into managing their fields. Outsider tenant farmers certainly had something to look forward to, but managing land often required borrowing. Originally, lending to tenant farmers was a sure-profit good business, and tenant farmers' loan requests could be said to be approved on demand. Now the Chen landlords mostly refused to lend on the excuse of heavy losses from bandit looting—one, the financial losses were real; two, rumors of "burden" plus "rent reduction" made them lose interest in managing land. Quite a few middle and upper-class families with commercial properties in the county seat or elsewhere simply left, entrusting their land to the clan. Surprisingly, quite a bit of land in Nansha lay fallow.

Nansha spent an entire year in this atmosphere of doubt and unease. Farmers couldn't get loans; renting oxen and buying fertilizer were both affected. Added to the heavy corvée, although the weather was fair, the year's harvest was only mediocre.

The rumored rent reduction and progressive tax didn't come, but the amount of Reasonable Burden increased considerably. Although Chen Xuan handled Australian duties capably, he had no ability in business development and relied entirely on "strict collection" to gather the year's Reasonable Burden. With two collections of Reasonable Burden in one year, the Chen families' savings were almost emptied.

However, he dared not say these words to Li Yao'er. To speak honestly, Li Yao'er was also partly responsible for the villagers' current predicament: just to repair Fenshenghe and restore production, the "corvée" requiring villagers to provide their own rations to burn bricks, transport timber... had made many people complain bitterly.

He pondered for a moment before saying tactfully: "The villagers had just suffered soldier chaos last spring, and their savings were all gone. The spring silkworms were also all ruined. Every family's vitality was greatly damaged..."

"Are you saying the current burden on the people of Nansha is too heavy?" Li Yao'er smiled.

Chen Lin's face reddened. Having his little thoughts seen through made him somewhat embarrassed, and he was also afraid of thus offending Second Uncle. He quickly said: "After great chaos, the people are hungry and weary. If they could be given some consideration, it would be good for both state and people."

Li Yao'er cocked her head and looked at him with interest, making Chen Lin's scalp tingle. Fortunately, this gaze didn't last long. He only heard her say: "How many days have you been back in Nansha?"

"Two... two days..."

"Then how do you know the burden on Nansha's people is too heavy and their savings are all gone?"

Cold sweat broke out on Chen Lin's head. He was deathly afraid of implicating the elder who wrote him the letter, Chen Qing's family, and his sister. He said in a panic: "This small one also heard it through hearsay, hearsay..."

"Don't be afraid," Li Yao'er said. "Although you heard it through hearsay, you weren't making things up either. The people of Nansha have indeed had considerable burdens this past year. Some families' savings have indeed been emptied..." She said "some families" with some meaning. Chen Lin broke out in another round of cold sweat.

"...However, there shouldn't be anyone here so poor they can't afford to eat, right?"

"This... indeed there isn't..." Chen Lin hurriedly nodded.

"It should be said that in Nansha now, some families' days are not as good as before," Li Yao'er said. "But for some common people, the days now are probably better than before."

Chen Lin hurriedly said: "Yes, yes..."

Li Yao'er changed the subject: "However, the Senate didn't come to Nansha just so everyone could have food to eat and call it done. We want everyone to be able to live better than before. The silk factory before your eyes is the hope—if Fenshenghe's enterprise succeeds, the people will gain more than just 'food and clothing.'"

"Yes, this small one knows." Chen Lin laughed bitterly to himself, thinking *you're just drawing cakes to satisfy hunger!* Right now it was true that Nansha's people had food to eat, but what they were eating was just the old savings. If Second Uncle was allowed to continue messing around like this, they wouldn't even be able to afford to raise silkworms this year! What silk reeling and satin weaving would there be to talk about?

He had originally just been perfunctorily answering Li Yao'er's questions, still being careful. At this moment, the youthful hot blood in his heart was stirred up, and he offered advice: "What the Chief says makes sense. It's just that New Year has already passed. After spring begins, the people need seeds for spring plowing, families without oxen need oxen, and families raising silkworms also need capital... After soldier chaos, all trades are desolate. I'm afraid everything needs to be managed and organized. Please may the Chief take note..."

Li Yao'er was stunned. When she came to Nansha, the news she received was "it's a prosperous village." So she hadn't paid much attention to the village's situation. Her own activities in the village with her guards and student were superficial; she roughly knew the village had suffered from bandit chaos, but the people getting by with food and clothing wasn't a problem.

Since food and clothing weren't a problem, and agricultural production in 1635 had also operated normally, after Nansha Village rested and recovered for more than half a year, this year's agricultural production should be no problem. Her promotion of new silkworm seeds and mulberry tree planting should be a natural progression. Yet this young man before her said "needs to be managed"?!

She hesitated and said: "How was last autumn's harvest? When I came to Nansha, everyone said there were no disasters and the harvest was fair."

"Chief, this small one doesn't know how the harvest of the entire Nansha Village was. Not to mention others, just the land under my family's name—last year's harvest was only sixty percent of the year before. Although this small one doesn't know about other families, roughly it's probably similar."

Li Yao'er's face changed. She had been active in rural areas promoting silkworm seeds and mulberry trees and understood the key points of agricultural production more or less. If Chen Lin wasn't being alarmist, after spring began this year, if the Senate didn't allocate loans to Nansha, it would be very difficult to carry out the new year's production and business activities.
