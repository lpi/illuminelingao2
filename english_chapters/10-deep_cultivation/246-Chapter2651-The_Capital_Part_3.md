# Chapter 2651: The Capital (Part 3)

His sudden interest in Zheng Sen was not a momentary whim; it was simply that the Imperial Court had recently gained a brief respite and could finally spare some attention to deal with the Hair Rebels.

Two years ago, when the Hair Rebels captured Guangzhou and swept through Liangguang, the court had discussed a southern expedition. However, the imperial forces in Liangguang had collapsed completely. The battalion soldiers and guard garrisons originally deployed there were almost entirely annihilated. Even the Governor-General of Liangguang, Xiong Wencan, had only managed to flee into Hunan with a few remnants of his defeated army, where he had been lingering on his last breath until now.

Losing armies and territory, abandoning two entire provinces—if this were the past, Xiong Wencan would have long since been held accountable and thrown into the imperial prison; by now, his head would likely have rotted away. That Chongzhen had kept him until now was firstly because the matter of the border territories was grave, and he was unwilling to easily change commanders. More importantly, the court had no troops to reinforce Liangguang, nor anyone else who could control the situation.

He had thought many times about arresting Xiong Wencan and bringing him to the capital for interrogation in the Sky Prison. But Wen Tiren had persuaded him: currently, there were more than a dozen civil and military officials capable of dealing with the Roving Bandits, and a few who could contend with the Eastern Barbarians, but officials who understood the situation of the Hair Rebels and had actually fought against them were extremely rare. Wang Zunde had been dead for several years, leaving Xiong Wencan as the sole remaining seedling. Therefore, he could only pinch his nose and let him "atone for his crimes through meritorious service."

Chongzhen was not entirely ignorant of the Hair Rebels. Over the years, through scattered memorials, garrison reports, and secret reports from the Eastern Depot and the Embroidered Uniform Guard, he had glimpsed some aspects of this thorny enemy. In particular, he had read the *Notes on Pacifying the Hairs*, which had been submitted for imperial review, many times. He knew he was facing a completely new opponent, different from the Eastern Barbarians and the Roving Bandits, as well as the Wokou and the Red-Hairs. Everything the court and the public knew about the Hair Rebels came from this small booklet. This was also the reason he had to tolerate Xiong Wencan until now.

Last year, he had revealed his intention to punish the Hairs to his cabinet ministers. Apart from Wen Tiren, the ministers had been vague in their attitudes, showing considerable disapproval. Indeed, the court was beset by internal trouble and external aggression at the time, and simply could not attend to a war in the distant south.

No matter how thorny the Hair Rebels were, "punishing the Hairs" was something that had to be done. Otherwise, he could not face the tumultuous criticism of the court and the public, and how would future generations view him as an emperor? Although the Xuande Emperor had abandoned Annam, Annam was merely a region beyond the pale of civilization, hardly counting as lost territory. But Liangguang was part of the empire handed down from the Taizu Emperor, ranked among the two capitals and thirteen administration commissions—how could it be discarded in his hands?! If the court lost two Provincial Administration Commissions and did not raise troops to punish the rebels, wouldn't "under the whole heaven, every spot is the sovereign's ground" become a joke? Would those increasingly arrogant military men still hold the court in any regard?

As a monarch, there were some grievances he could not discuss with his ministers; he could only sigh secretly.

These days, apart from the Grand Secretariat having already decided to levy a "Guangdong Surtax" starting from the ninth year of Chongzhen, there was no conclusion on who to select as Commander-in-Chief or which troops to mobilize. Even the attitude of Wen Tiren, on whom he had always relied, was rather ambiguous. In his words, he revealed a hope for "pacification."

Given the court's current situation, "pacification" might indeed be a choice. It was just that his intuition told him the Hair Rebels' appetite was likely enormous, and they would not agree to ordinary conditions. Even if, as the cabinet ministers suggested, he promised them Qiongzhou Prefecture, they might not necessarily be satisfied. Moreover, ceding territory would cause an uproar in public opinion; the very thought of such a scandalous act against heaven and earth made the Emperor shudder.

Only by letting the Hair Rebels know the court's power would it be possible for them to accept pacification.

Come to think of it, it was ridiculous. The Eastern Barbarians occupied the bitter cold lands of the Northeast; originally, Old Nurhaci was just a small personal guard under Li Chengliang, with hundreds of followers and no more than a few dozen armored men. Since his grandfather raised troops in his later years, in merely twenty or thirty years, he had beaten the court into repeated retreats, losing all of Liaodong. As for these Hair Rebels, it was heard that when they first arrived, they had no more than a few large ships and a few hundred people. They drifted to Qiongzhou, this remote southern borderland, barely surviving on industry and commerce. Yet now they had trained elite troops and generals, sweeping through Liangguang in one fell swoop. His Great Ming possessed a vast empire of ten thousand *li*, hundreds of millions of subjects, and thousands of civil and military officials, yet it could do nothing against these two great barbarian groups, one in the north and one in the south, and was forced to consider the idea of "pacification"...

Thinking of this, the Emperor felt a wave of misery in his heart. He could never understand—the Great Ming was clearly extremely powerful, so how had it fallen to such a state?

 seeing that he remained silent and looked dazed after dinner, Concubine Tian knew he was worrying about state affairs again. Fearing that his pent-up grief after eating would cause indigestion, she hurriedly used words to divert his attention, speaking of the "Divine Physician" and "Immortal Medicine" that had been rumored widely in the capital recently.

Although the capital was grand in scale, its urban environment was far from complimentary due to the large population and the perennial sandstorms of the north. In the early years when national power was strong and officials were competent, there was some management of environmental hygiene. But in the final years of the dynasty, people's hearts were unsettled and social order was chaotic; the original management systems existed in name only. In recent years, due to the Eastern Barbarians entering the borders to plunder, a large population had flooded into the city. Infectious diseases were rampant everywhere—diarrhea, coughing, fever... Although infectious diseases mainly prevailed among the lower-class people who lacked clean drinking water and lived in harsh environments, high officials and noble personages could not remain immune. Many people fell ill, and quite a few officials took leave for this reason. However, by 17th-century standards, this did not yet qualify as a "plague."

Concubine Tian's father had also fallen ill, and at one point his condition was quite grave, causing her great anxiety. However, palace rules did not allow concubines to visit their families, not even their own fathers. She could only have some medicine prepared from the Imperial Pharmacy and sent home. Not long ago, her family finally came to report that her father had recovered. It was said he had taken medicine from a Divine Physician, and the diarrhea that originally could not be stopped had ceased in just two days.

The medicine prescribed by this Divine Physician showed remarkable efficacy after being taken, particularly for coughing, fever, and diarrhea—it could be called immediate. Therefore, it caused an instant sensation in the capital. Even the Emperor, deep within the palace, had heard of it—after all, reporting market news was one of the daily duties of the Eastern Depot and the Embroidered Uniform Guard.

Chongzhen did not take this matter to heart: the capital was gathered with high officials and nobles. Since they were human, they had seven emotions and six desires, as well as three disasters and six calamities. Thus, monks, Daoists, physiognomists, and divine physicians had always been most keen to come to this "place of the Emperor." The emergence of a "Living Immortal" was nothing new. As long as they did not "spread fallacies to deceive the crowd," he generally couldn't be bothered to inquire.

When Concubine Tian mentioned this, he just treated it as after-dinner entertainment, listening casually without paying much attention. But when Concubine Tian said: "...This Divine Physician Zhou's medical skills are indeed superb. Especially the medicines he prepares himself; they are effective for almost every symptom, no inferior to the Hair Rebels' medicine..."

He suddenly shuddered and asked sternly, "What did you say?!"

Concubine Tian had seen the Emperor looking gentle, his eyes half-closed, his face relaxed and enjoying himself. She hadn't expected his face to suddenly turn ferocious. Feeling afraid in her heart, she panicked and said, "This concubine said that the Divine Physician's medicine is extremely effective..."

"No, you said it is no inferior to whose medicine?!"

"H... Hair... Hair Rebels..." Concubine Tian groaned inwardly. Why mention this for no reason! Although she was in the harem, through the eunuchs around her and the family members sent by her father to deliver items every month, she knew a thing or two about the current political situation. The Hair Rebels were one of the Four Great Calamities of the world written by the Emperor on the screen in the Palace of Heavenly Purity.

"Hair Rebels, Hair Rebels," Chongzhen repeated the term repeatedly. After a long while, he asked, "What is the background of this Divine Physician Zhou? Where did your father invite him from?"

"He was recommended by the new Minister of War, Lord Wang." Concubine Tian dared not conceal it.

*That would be Wang Yehao*, Chongzhen thought. After the death of Minister of War Zhang Fengyi, he had been acting in the ministry's affairs with the title of Left Vice Minister of War. However, the Emperor felt he was not a suitable candidate for Vice Minister of War, so he had decided to recall Yang Sichang, who was at home observing mourning, to active duty, overriding the mourning period. At the same time, to allow Wang Yehao to work with peace of mind, he specially granted him the title of Minister of War.

However, Chongzhen had never liked this person. Although he had been reasonably competent during his terms as Grand Coordinator of Zhejiang and Left Vice Minister of War, this man was a member of the Zhejiang Faction. Although he had been stripped of his status by the Eunuch Faction in the sixth year of Tianqi for submitting a memorial regarding the Wanggongchang Explosion, the Zhejiang Faction's past of attaching themselves to the Eunuch Faction made the Emperor harbor a grudge against these old members of the Zhejiang Faction.

Monks, Daoists, physiognomists, and physicians who gained great fame in the capital mostly had the power of gentry and noble families behind them—without this, they could not establish a foothold. It was not surprising that Wang Yehao was Doctor Zhou's backer. Tian Hongyu was Concubine Tian's father; Wang recommending a divine physician to treat his illness to curry favor with the "Imperial Father-in-law" was all common practice.

However, Chongzhen was extremely wary of the harem interfering in politics. Wang Yehao's move made him suspect whether this person was plotting to blow some pillow talk into his ears through Concubine Tian. His face immediately turned somewhat dark.

Seeing his face suddenly darken, Concubine Tian became even more flustered. Just as she wanted to open her mouth to explain a few sentences, she suddenly remembered her father saying that if one encountered a situation difficult to handle, stillness was better than movement. She simply remained silent, waiting for others to speak first.

Fortunately, the Emperor's mood was decent today. Recalling that he had started the inquiry about the Divine Physician himself, it seemed unrelated to any plea for influence. So his expression quickly returned to a relaxed state, but he made a mental note of the matter regarding Wang Yehao and Divine Physician Zhou. He secretly reminded himself to have Wu Mengming investigate this carefully tomorrow.

"What is this Divine Physician's name?"

"This, your concubine also does not know. The family servant only mentioned it in passing when delivering the message..." Concubine Tian answered cautiously. She had more or less guessed the Emperor's thoughts just now.

"Let's not talk about this Divine Physician," Chongzhen shook his head. "You said just now that it works even better than the Hair Rebels' medicine—is there Hair Rebel medicine in the capital?"

"As for the Hair Rebel medicines circulating in the capital, your concubine knows of seven or eight kinds. Most are common household medicines for peace of mind. The most famous ones are Zhuge Marching Powder and Plague-Repelling Powder."

Chongzhen remembered. During the *Jiaxu* year examinations (1634), the Embroidered Uniform Guard had secretly reported that someone had purchased a large amount of pills and powders to distribute for free to the scholars coming to the capital. The main medicine distributed was Plague-Repelling Powder, and it was heard that the effect was not bad. As for the people distributing the medicine, they were just some local wealthy households intending to accumulate merit and do good deeds. He had put it aside after hearing it.

"Plague-Repelling Powder, isn't that from a pharmacy in Guang..." he said casually, then suddenly remembered: didn't the Hair Rebels start in Guangdong? So the Hair Rebels' tentacles had already extended into the capital at that time!
