# Chapter 2695: The Capital (Part 47)

According to Zhou Lezhi's thinking, with the existence of such a "Confidant" as Liang Cunhou, Master Wang would probably introduce the Teacher to the *Yuyuan* Society. However, he guessed completely wrong; the Teacher didn't know the existence of the *Yuyuan* Society from beginning to end.

The one who went to exchange with the *Yuyuan* Society was unexpectedly him, Zhou Lezhi.

"You go to *Yuyuan* Society to exchange what you have. Anything can be said, only two things cannot be said:" Wang Yehao exhorted, "One is Hearthstone Immortal; two is 'Heavenly Book'."

"What about those books written by the Teacher? If someone asks for advice, should I..."

"No hindrance. Regarding *Ao* Learning, you can speak without reservation."

"Yes, the lowly one understands."

"When seeing me later, no need to call yourself 'the lowly one'; just call yourself 'Student.' In the future, you will count as a gentleman advisor in my tent."

Zhou Lezhi was overjoyed, immediately kneeling to kowtow, saying: "Many thanks for the Master's grace."

Originally he belonged to "Concubine body undefined" in the Wang Prefecture; although counting as "Hearthstone Daoist's" disciple, in reality he was about the same as Wang family servants. Seeing Master Wang he had to kneel and bow, calling him Master [Laoye]. Starting from now, he was a "Sir" [Xiangsheng] treated with equal courtesy properly. This was a huge leap in life for him, a farm boy unsuccessful in reading books.

"Work with heart; in the future, you won't lack being a Student of the Imperial College."

"Yes, still need Master to support and guide more." Zhou Lezhi bowed to the ground imitating the appearance of a scholar. He asked again: "If there are some questions Student also doesn't know, can I answer after asking Mr. Zhou?"

"No harm. Just don't let them know."

Zhou Lezhi's appearance at the *Yuyuan* Society immediately caused a sensation among the members. At that time, the *Yuyuan* Society had fewer than seven or eight people in total; besides Liang Cunhou, it was an extremely small circle among Guangzhou scholars.

Liang was quite attentive when selecting people; he wouldn't accept someone into the society just because they were purely interested in Shorn-hair Thieves and Thief objects. After all, these objects were novel and fun; almost everyone was interested. Only those with some insight and knowledge regarding Shorn-hair Thieves and Thief objects could enter the society.

However, no matter how much insight they had, it was just half-understood knowledge; how could they have Zhou Lezhi's coherent logic and mastery? After going two or three times, he solemnly became the "Master of *Ao* Learning" of the *Yuyuan* Society. Liang Cunhou then invited him to come to Guangzhou twice a month to give lectures, passing on the Dao and imparting professional knowledge.

As for the Teacher's writings, they didn't cause too big a sensation—as Australians returned to Guangzhou, many Australian books also began to appear on the market. After Liang Cunhou sent people to purchase them, besides keeping one copy in *Yuyuan* Society, he sent another copy to Zhaoqing.

The Teacher's reaction to these books varied. Most he appreciated quite a bit, even using them as textbooks to teach. But some books he sniffed at disdainfully. For example, this *The Legend of the Condor Heroes*.

This book wasn't sent by Liang Cunhou—his focus in buying books was *Ao* Learning; this kind of novel naturally wasn't within it. So when this book appeared in the Teacher's courtyard, and even in Yourong's room, he was obviously startled.

"Where did this book come from?" Mr. Zhou held up the book volume, questioning Yourong sternly.

Yourong gave birth to a son in the capital as she wished. The son was picked up by people sent by Wang Yehao at half a year old to the Zhou Residence in the Governor-General's Office in Zhaoqing. The Teacher was overjoyed, immediately naming him Zhou Newton.

The current Yourong could be said to be satisfied. Although Mr. Zhou didn't say who was big and who was small [wife ranking], Yourong felt she was a "meritorious official," and her arrogance obviously suppressed Jieyi.

Yourong relied on "having merit," plus this Mr. Zhou had a soft temper and loved children most, her arrogance in this Zhou Residence became increasingly high.

Suddenly seeing the Master change to a face of fierce god and evil spirit at this moment, she was scared into hurriedly putting away her petty temper, answering in a small voice: "It was Wang Zhi who bought it back."

"Wang Zhi!" The Teacher shouted a throatful towards the courtyard. Wang Zhi, waiting outside, hurriedly ran over.

"What instructions does the Master have?"

"You bought this book?"

Wang Zhi took the book to look, scratching his head recalling: "Should be right. No one else reads books in our residence. It was all Miss Yourong asking to buy some novels and songbooks for pastime."

Compared to Jieyi who didn't recognize a few big characters, Yourong's cultural level was indeed much higher. Not only was she proficient in all kinds of poetry and songs, but playing instruments and singing were also unique skills. Originally Zhou Lezhi wanted to cultivate her well, pity that within a few days he discovered that a classical *tsundere* literary girl and a modern straight science middle-aged man were really not people of the same road. Separated by a generation gap of nearly four hundred years, exchanging feelings was not as easy as exchanging body fluids.

Yourong here also experienced the thought process from joy to disillusionment universally. When she first knew the one taking a concubine was an advisor in the Governor's Yamen, Yourong was truly happy for a while. However, later seeing the real person, she discovered the other party was unexpectedly a person without learning or skills. Not only was he not refined in poetry and prose, and didn't know Ci and Qu, sometimes he couldn't even understand the notes handed over by Master Wang.

Although academic arts were not refined, at any rate there was Master Wang taking care; he could be counted as mixing with wind and water [successful]. Only pity that honors like "Lady of Mandate" wouldn't fall on her.

"Bought from where?" The Teacher continued to press Wang Zhi.

"Guangzhou's *Ziyuan* Bookshop. A newly opened bookstore, quite a big shop front, very magnificent."

"This is probably also Manager Guo's business, right?"

"Yes, Australian books originally sold by *Zizhenzhai* are now all moved there to sell. Also added many books. Besides this novel, there are also many painting books..."

"*Lianhuanhua* [Linked Ring Pictures/Comics]."

"Probably called this name. Few words and many pictures, convenient to read. And cheap; many people buy..."

"You also bought?"

"Yes..." Wang Zhi didn't know why he suddenly got energy over this matter. "Bought a few volumes."

"Bring for me to see."

Holding the *Lianhuanhua* in hand gave a familiar feeling; turned out to be a few volumes of *The Biography of Yue Fei*.

"Is the full set fifteen volumes?"

"Yes..." Wang Zhi looked at the Master somewhat surprised. "Couldn't afford the full set; bought a few first. Wait for monthly money to be issued then buy a few more."

"You go." The Teacher waved Wang Zhi away.

Zhou Lezhi didn't understand why the Teacher was so startled and fussy. This Australian novel wasn't some rare object. The Teacher didn't know, but he who frequently went to Guangzhou knew clearly and distinctly.

"Teacher, this is the latest batch of Australian books sent by the Liang Residence."

"You just put on the table." The Teacher said impatiently, picking up *The Legend of the Condor Heroes* again.

"Even this book is reprinted; they must be full and have nothing to do!"

Turning a page, the Teacher's gaze fell on the cover: "Even the author is changed! Shameless! Don't know what Old Man Cha would think seeing this..."

Zhou Lezhi asked carefully: "This author..."

"The author is not this person." The Teacher said, tossing the book to the side carelessly. "Probably there are also *The Return of the Condor Heroes* and *The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber*, right?"

"These I haven't seen."

"Was the book also got by that Liang Cunhou?"

"Yes, according to Master Liang, Australians also opened bookstores in Guangzhou now..."

"Steps are striding bigger and bigger." Mr. Zhou started his headless and tailless monologue again. "Cultural infiltration, tsk tsk..."

Zhou Lezhi dared not speak, only watching the Teacher flip through various latest Australian books sent over in the study. Whenever books involving Classics, History, Philosophers, and Collections were involved, he picked them out directly and threw them aside. The rest, classified according to Industry, Agriculture, and Science three categories, fell to Zhou Lezhi to register and put on the bookshelf.

"Really have theirs," The Teacher muttered to himself while classifying, "Character base and inferior, but foresight is tall and far."

The book collection became more and more. Because book sources increased, the times the Teacher wrote teaching materials himself became fewer and fewer. Mostly he made annotations and modifications on bought *Ao* books, then conducted lectures.

"Teacher, Shorn-hair Thieves print and sell their own learning like this; aren't they afraid others will learn it all and also create military and national sharp weapons?"

"Hehe," The Teacher sneered, "This is exactly their formidable point!" He picked up a book casually. "This book is an example."

This was *Elementary Theory of Optics*. The Teacher used it as a textbook, teaching many optical knowledge. Because they had prisms, telescopes, magnifying glasses, etc. optical equipment bought from *Zizhenzhai* on hand, learning got twice the result with half the effort. Many optical principles were explained clearly very easily.

"...This book talks about optical principles throughout, also teaching the structure of many optical equipment. But having only this book, can you make these telescopes and magnifying glasses?"

"Difficult..."

"Correct. Just knowing principles and structure, even having the real object, still can't make it. Although we know how to smelt glass, we don't know how to make colorless transparent glass, nor do we know how to grind to make concave and convex lenses of different degrees... These all need the support of a system. Understand now?"

Zhou Lezhi was thoughtful. Said: "Speaking so, making every component needs a book..."

"This is exactly where their scheming heart lies. Does everyone not know Australian learning is formidable and useful? I let you learn, but even if you learn you can't use it. But wait until the day they also come to Guangzhou; those people who learned Australian learning, they can use it then."

Zhou Lezhi involuntarily shivered a cold war: "Teacher, you mean, Shorn-hair Thieves in the future still want to... want to... hit Guangdong?"

"I fear they even want to drink horses at the Yangtze River, contending for the World!"

This terrible future made Zhou Lezhi shudder without cold. After all, Guangdong, especially the vicinity of Guangzhou, had been considered peaceful for nearly a hundred years, without major wars.

"Is there a method to block the Shorn-hair Thieves' ambition?"

The Teacher looked at him once, suddenly laughing: "You actually have quite the ambition of embracing the world..."

"Teacher is joking; it concerns the safety of native land [Sangzi]. How can one place it outside of degree [disregard it]?" Zhou Lezhi said solemnly, "Has Teacher not heard the miserable conditions of Sanshan, Sanliang, and various places?"

Hearthstone Immortal's expression was somewhat surprised, seemingly not expecting his own student to say such words. He watched him silently for a long while before saying: "Now Australian power is formed; wanting to set up a dignified formation to deal with them is as hard as ascending to heaven. Only by starting secretly, doing acts of chicken crow and dog steal [espionage/covert ops]."

He pondered for a moment and said: "Starting today, I will teach you the Australian Techniques of Espionage."
