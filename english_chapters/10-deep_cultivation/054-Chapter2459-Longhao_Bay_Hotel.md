# Chapter 2459 - Longhao Bay Hotel

Everyone present originally felt that this Chen Xiaobing had somewhat of a stern air, but now that they conversed, they found his attitude approachable and his speech humorous. He neither pretended to be refined nor kept a straight face like some naturalized cadres. They unconsciously felt a bit closer to him.

The city rail started slowly. Chen Lin was a teenager after all, and was very curious about the scenery along the way, asking questions from time to time. The scenery at the next station was very different from before. Along the railway line was a small town with various oddly shaped buildings. Flags of various kinds flew on some roofs. Suddenly he saw a towering tower in the town—he recognized this: wasn't this a church of the Franks (Portuguese)?

"The houses here seem to be foreign!"

Wu Yijun had been to Macau and was knowledgeable. He laughed: "These are all European-style houses. In Europe, besides the Franks, there are Red-haired people (Dutch), English people, and Germans, all different, and their houses are different too."

"In that case, isn't this like Macau?"

"You could say that, but also not." Chen Xiaobing said, "To say yes, this is Lingao's 'Expatriate Residential Area.' The residents are mainly Europeans who come to Lingao to work or do business for a long time, and their families, as well as a small number of foreigners from other places. So the houses are built according to the characteristics of their respective countries. There are even two churches prepared. Belonging to Europeans of different faiths."

"Don't all Europeans believe in God?"

"Although it is one God, the doctrines are different." Chen Xiaobing said, "The new and old sects are like water and fire. They even fight wars in Europe."

"Then won't they fight here? Living all together."

"Fights are inevitable, but if they violate the law, they will be severely punished—it is not easy for them to get a Green Card to reside in Lingao, so they dare not easily commit crimes. After all, coming to China from thousands of miles away is to make money."

"What is a Green Card?"

"A Green Card is an official permit allowing foreigners to reside long-term on our territory. With this permit, they can live and work anywhere under the Senate's rule. Very convenient."

"Then where is the difference?" Chen Lin remembered and asked further.

"The difference is that the Portuguese in Macau—whom you call Franks—are nominally under the jurisdiction of the Xiangshan County Magistrate of Great Ming and have to pay land rent every year, but in reality, they have their own Municipal Council, courts, and army, and they collect taxes. Once past the border gate, it is just like a foreign land. Here, they still have to act according to the laws of the Great Song."

The Chen uncle and nephew just listened to this as a novelty, but Wu Yijun was quite touched. Although he was not a foreign merchant, he dealt with foreign merchants a lot: foreign merchants going to Luzon often transported large quantities of dried fruits. He knew a little bit. He knew that the government of Great Ming was extremely wary of foreigners and did not want them to come. Foreign merchants all said this just let the Franks in Macau earn big money as middlemen for nothing.

This Senate did not care about foreigners at all, and even let them live together in a corner, reside freely, and do business, treating them like nationals. Truly rare!

The train traveled all the way and soon reached Bopu. Because the hydrological conditions of the port were relatively poor, Bopu's port function had been gradually weakened in recent years. Bopu's original status as "Lingao's Maritime Gateway" was also declining. A series of institutions originally set up here, such as customs, border inspection, and epidemic prevention, moved away one after another, and even cranes were much fewer. After the opening of Xinying and Hongpai ports, most goods and personnel entering and exiting entered Lingao from these two.

Although the throughput of passengers and cargo had decreased significantly, Bopu had superior geographical location after all. As Lingao's outer port, there was still a large amount of people and goods converging here, and commerce remained very prosperous.

The inspection group got off at Bopu Station. The Longhao Bay Hotel where the inspection group stayed was in Bopu.

As soon as they left the train station, a team of rickshaws was waiting outside. Due to the local climate, it was difficult to raise and use horses in large quantities in Lingao. This caused the promotion of carriages to be repeatedly frustrated. Except for a small amount of production of two-wheeled and four-wheeled carriages for private use, public carriage systems were only established in Bairen, the Old County Seat, and Bopu. Apart from that, the widely used short-distance transportation tool was the rickshaw. Because it was light and convenient with low usage cost, not only did natives and naturalized citizens use it universally, but many Elders also kept their own rickshaws and pullers.

The inspection group took two people per rickshaw, and seven or eight rickshaws set off for the hotel together.

The rickshaw team did not go towards the town area in the south but went west all the way after leaving the station area. Moving along a seaside avenue.

This seaside avenue was paved with coal cinders, wide and flat. The "Venus Zero" rickshaws ran on it very smoothly, which was very novel for the Chen uncle and nephew who took a rickshaw for the first time. Compared to sitting in a sedan chair, two people riding in the same rickshaw were indeed a bit crowded, but it moved fast and steadily, not bumpy like ordinary carts. Being able to look around at the scenery, it was truly a wonderful thing.

On both sides of the seaside avenue, rows of coconut trees were planted—at a considerable distance from the road surface to avoid coconuts falling and hitting people when they matured. Beside the road were flower beds planted with various flowers and trees whose names they couldn't call. Although it was January, the weather in Hainan was warm, and branches were full of blooms. Green leaves and fresh flowers, blue sky and coconut groves, made people forget they were in winter.

Although the seaside avenue did not lead to the town center, there were quite a few pedestrians and vehicles on the road. There were rickshaws as well as many heavy-laden ox carts, towing various goods, moving slowly.

Not far along, there was a green hedge wall by the roadside, with lush flowers and trees inside, and the eaves of houses revealed. The Chen uncle and nephew wondered what place this was. After walking a bit further, they saw a towering silhouette gradually appearing from the horizon. Chen Xiaobing sitting in the first car turned around and shouted loudly:

"Look! That is the Holy Ship!"

Hearing that this was the big iron ship of the Australians that broke through ten thousand miles of sea frontiers, everyone's eyes widened, looking in the direction of the iron ship. Although the distance was far, the majestic figure of the big iron ship left a deep impression on everyone. The huge cranes, tall chimneys, and the huge body like a castle...

Chen Lin lost his voice: "Truly spectacular!"

Chen Ding also said: "Indeed, hearing a hundred times is not as good as seeing once!"

The rickshaw team passed in front of a gate tower at this time. Chen Lin saw the sign at the door and knew that this place surrounded by hedges was "Lingao Cape Park." Since the recovery of Guangzhou, the Guangzhou City Government had also set up Bai'etan Park in Bai'etan, so he knew that a park was a place for commoners to rest and play.

The convoy did not stop here but continued along the seaside avenue. A red brick building began to appear on the horizon. Chen Lin marveled secretly: *This house is so tall!*

This was the "Longhao Bay Hotel" where they would stay today.

Longhao Bay Hotel was not a property of the Senate but built with funds pooled by local wealthy merchants. These big households included local natives and outsiders who had moved here. The leader was the Li family, who was engaging extensively in real estate development in Lingao. Li Xiaopeng had made a fortune after developing several real estate projects for outsiders moving in. Seeing that the "Qiong'an Inn" his family opened specially for big households also had good performance, he thought that a hotel was also a way to make money. So he calculated to open a hotel.

Hotels were not rare in Lingao. Especially the hostels opened by the Qiwei Group, known for being cheap, good quality, hygienic, and comfortable. They not only enjoyed a high reputation in Lingao and Hainan but also had many branches in Guangdong. Li Xiaopeng thought about it: his family had no advantage in this aspect, so it wasn't easy to compete directly.

Where was his family's advantage? Li Xiaopeng summarized the trick from Qiong'an Inn: to open a hotel, he had to target rich people. Open an "Australian Grand Hotel" that locals had never seen before.

Speaking of Australian Grand Hotels, Li Xiaopeng heard it from Elders, especially Elder Hong Huangnan. Because of running Shop No. 82, Elder Hong put a lot of energy into the manufacturing and operation of luxury goods. But Shop No. 82 was the Senate's property after all. Developing so many products, the market capacity was limited if relying only on Elders and their families for consumption. He had always intended to choose local partners to replicate a new No. 82.

Li Xiaopeng happened to be one of the local big households who had long been running around and ingratiating himself in front of him. Especially when opening Qiong'an Inn, although it was Li Xiaopeng's idea, Elder Hong had put forward many suggestions on interior decoration, furniture display, and service items. Li also heard many anecdotes about "Australian Grand Hotels" from Elder Hong and couldn't help longing for it.

So he found Hong Huangnan and told him his idea. He immediately received support. However, Elder Hong also said that the design, management, and operation software of this Australian Grand Hotel could be helped with, but the hardware construction of the hotel would cost a huge sum, which might be impossible to open with the Li family's personal financial resources.

Li Xiaopeng immediately expressed that it didn't matter; he had many rich merchant friends who had moved to Lingao from other places. They had plenty of money in hand and only worried about having no place to invest and make money. If there were good projects, they were willing to pay.

So this project officially began. Li Xiaopeng finally pulled in fifteen shareholders to pool funds to build this "Australian-style Hotel." Named "Longhao Bay Hotel."

Longhao Bay Hotel was located by Longhao Bay on the seaside avenue. Not only was it adjacent to Lingao Cape Park, but it also specially enclosed a piece of private beach for hotel use only. The hotel was a five-story neoclassical red brick building with three restaurants and forty-eight guest rooms. The interior decoration was all "Australian style"; floors, tap water, bathrooms, and flush toilets went without saying, and it was the first time full electric lighting was installed in a civilian building, and a manually operated elevator was installed. There was also an open-air restaurant on the roof of the building, with bright lights at night. It could be seen from several kilometers away. Just after opening, it attracted a large crowd of onlookers, blocking the streets.
