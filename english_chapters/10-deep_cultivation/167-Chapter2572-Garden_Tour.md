# Chapter 2572 - Garden Tour

The two examination classmates met and talked continuously along the way, appearing very warm and intimate. Anyone unaware of the circumstances might have thought they were old friends reuniting after many years.

In reality, Liu Dalin and Chen Zizhuang weren't particularly familiar—they couldn't even be called close friends, merely "acquainted." But between them existed the most powerful and most "ironclad" social relationship in Ming dynasty society: "examination classmates."

Ming dynasty scholars staked their entire life's fate on passing the imperial examinations. Before obtaining an official position through the jinshi degree, one could generally only study the Four Books and one's chosen Classic, deliberating over the eight-legged essay format. Only after passing the jinshi examination could one behold the grandeur of the capital, tour the realm's famous sites, and gain the relationships of classmates, teacher-student, and superior-subordinate, making acquaintances among "the realm's outstanding talents."

The Ming dynasty imperial examinations were extremely difficult. From licentiate to provincial graduate, most licentiates never crossed this threshold despite studying until their hair turned white. But once they crossed it, they had "defied fate and changed destiny," stepping into the ranks of the "gentry." If they then succeeded in the metropolitan examination and obtained the jinshi degree, they became people of the clouds.

Precisely because Ming scholars treated the examinations as their lifeline—especially since most came from commoner backgrounds and lacked powerful supporters when first entering officialdom—they had no choice but to rely on the examination teacher-student and jinshi classmate relationships established in the examination halls to spread a complex web of interests. Successful examinees honored examiners as their "seat-teachers," calling themselves "disciples"—"a teacher for a day is a father for life." All who passed together became examination classmates: "ten-thousand-li subjects under one heaven, brothers of one hall from the same hometown." Complete strangers, once they had the examination-classmate relationship, became brothers, sharing fortune and misfortune. If on top of the classmate relationship there was also fellow-townsman friendship, the bond was even more ironclad.

For scholars aspiring to official careers, such relationships were both emotional bonds and political capital, thus highly valued. They were often as close as father-and-son or brothers, forming political factions with these bonds as their core. Individuals within might benefit from these relationships or be burdened by them. But overall, the benefits outweighed the burdens. Even if defeated in court political struggles, as long as one could still retire intact, returning to one's hometown, one could rely on the networks built by classmates in both court and local levels to continue living the high life as a gentry grandee.

When there were no conflicts of interest, examination classmates were happy to socialize and visit each other. The primary means of strengthening classmate bonds was holding classmate gatherings, said to have begun in the Eastern Han dynasty. In the Ming, classmate gatherings were liveliest for first-time gatherings, mainly because all newly-minted jinshi were concentrated in the capital. At the end of gatherings, to maintain connections, they would habitually compile a roster in order of age, called the "Classmate Register." Since this was privately compiled by the jinshi, it was also called the "Private Register." The official register compiled by authorities listed candidates by rank order, called the "Public Register." Since classmate jinshi's positions changed frequently, classmate registers "would necessarily be reprinted every few years to record actual appointments and shared memories."

By the lakeside pavilion, a banquet had already been set. Handsome pageboys and pretty maidservants stood in attendance.

Chen Zilü, as host, was welcoming the guests attending the banquet. Besides Chen Zilü, everyone else was an examination classmate from Chen Zizhuang's same cohort.

The forty-seventh year of Wanli was a distinguished class. Historically famous figures Chen Zizhuang, He Wuzhou, Yuan Chonghuan, Ma Shiying, and Sun Chuanting were all jinshi from this examination. Among them, Chen Zizhuang, He Wuzhou, Yuan Chonghuan, Liu Dalin, Yao Dian, Zhao Xunru, Zhu Zuochang, Huang Yingxiu, and Guan Jiyi were all Lingnan scholars. Chen Zizhuang and He Wuzhou were old neighbors. Huang Yingxiu and Chen Zizhuang's cousin Zhu Shilian had formed a poetry society at Jiujiang's Zhengjue Temple. Yao Dian and Zhu Zuochang were fellow townsmen with Yuan Chonghuan from Dongguan. These people all had very close dealings. Only Liu Dalin was from the remote Hainan Island, and because of his physical condition couldn't take office. Aside from occasional correspondence, he had gradually faded from these classmates' social circles.

---

Everyone gazed at Liu Dalin from afar. They saw him wearing a cotton-style reformed hanfu, holding an exquisite long tobacco pipe, his complexion ruddy—clearly living quite well under the Australians' care. They all came forward to welcome him.

He Wuzhou called out a greeting: "Mengliang, haven't seen you in years. Your color gets better and better."

"Brother Longyou [He Wuzhou], Brother Housheng [Zhao Xunru], Brother Shengjin [Yao Dian], Brother Shunhu [Chen Zilü]—you're all well!" After over a decade confined to bed by paralysis, this was Liu Dalin's first time seeing so many classmates at once. His heart couldn't help but stir with emotion, and he tremblingly tried to stand up.

Though they were all jinshi from the same examination, He Wuzhou, Zhao Xunru, and Yao Dian were about twelve years older than Chen Zizhuang and Liu Dalin—already white-templed elders in their fifties or sixties. He Wuzhou had been dismissed and sent home due to factional conflict with Wen Tiren. Zhao Xunru had long since taken leave to retire home and nurse his ailments. Yao Dian had also retired in the seventh year of Tianqi. Later, upon hearing that Yuan Chonghuan had been cruelly executed despite his innocence, he was deeply shocked and had since secluded himself in the countryside, ignoring worldly affairs.

Seeing that Liu Dalin still struggled greatly to rise, He Wuzhou strode forward and helped support him together with Chen Zizhuang, laughing: "Who would have thought that after galloping through the examination halls together in our youth, in our old age we'd still depend on these old bones to support each other, ha ha ha..."

"As the saying goes, it takes a hundred lifetimes of cultivation to share a boat crossing—that's an immense fate. And since Brother Shunhu has already prepared colorful boats, ha ha..."

"'Love Only,' 'Rest Upon,' 'Fish Length,' 'Playing in Azure,' 'Floating Home'—even the boat names are so elegant. Today we must produce works for the ages."

Since ancient times when literati gathered, they did nothing but compose verse, drink wine, play music, and discourse on current affairs. Today with clear skies, after a round of pleasantries, everyone boarded small boats to tour the Vegetable Leaf Lake. The lake surface rippled with blue waves, the garden fragrant with birdsong and flowers. The sound of Buddhist chanting drifted slowly from Changchun Nunnery, giving one the feeling of entering a painting.

A contemporary poem said:

*A garden built to rival Penglai's realm,*
*Cassia and pepper planted in their turn.*
*By midnight sword-light, dragons reunite;*
*For days discussing literature, guests return.*

*On lofty branches in warm spring, orioles sing clever;*
*From miasma seas, calm winds let mirages appear.*
*No need for astrologers to read the virtue-stars—*
*Our colorful brushes already shine far and near.*

After boating to their hearts' content, everyone ascended Shuxiao Tower at the lake's center. Chen Zilü had already arranged brushes, ink, paper, and inkstone there for guests to compose calligraphy and leave behind treasured works.

Seeing everyone in high spirits, Chen Zizhuang felt the moment was ripe. He said to Liu Dalin: "Mengliang, it's been so long since we've enjoyed such carefree poetry and song. Today has been truly exhilarating. It's just a pity..."

Liu Dalin noticed he hadn't finished his sentence, as if there was something else. He asked: "Jisheng speaks but stops—is there something difficult to say?"

"It's a pity we haven't heard the music of heavenly instruments..." Chen Zizhuang said with some regret.

"How is that difficult? Jisheng, you're accomplished in all four arts—qin, chess, calligraphy, painting. If you'd be willing to play a tune, we couldn't ask for more," Liu Dalin said.

Chen Zizhuang said: "I know of two famous qins in the city. One is called Green Silk Terrace, made in the early Tang dynasty, once the personal qin of our dynasty's Emperor Wuzong. The other is called South Wind, a former possession of Song Emperor Lizong. If these two qins could be played today, it would be worthy of our gathering."

"Oh? Does Qiutao mean we must go find these two famous qins before you'll perform?" Yao Dian asked teasingly.

"No, no!" Chen Zizhuang said. "These two qins belong to a young friend of mine. On ordinary days, I could borrow them. But the qin's owner is currently imprisoned, and I'm anxious and unsettled..."

Liu Dalin now understood. After all this circling, apparently there was a favor to be asked. He inquired: "I wonder what your young friend's name is, and what crime he committed?"

Chen Zizhuang said: "Kuang Lu, styled Zhanruo. He studied under Master Hanshan from childhood. His elder cousin followed Supervisor Yuan and died on the Liaodong battlefield—a family of loyalty and righteousness. Zhanruo once offended Huang Xiyin, the former Nanhai County Magistrate, and fled far from home for many years, only recently returning. A few days ago at the Nanhai Academy, he happened to encounter Huang Xiyin. Huang Xiyin insulted his cousin, so in indignation he beat him, and was detained by the Australian police for this."

"I see. Jisheng, don't worry. What your young friend did is not a serious crime—there should be no major problems." Liu Dalin had spent many years in Lingao and understood the Senate's legal system fairly well. Since Huang Xiyin held no official position and wasn't a cadre, under Senate law, beating someone without causing serious injury would just mean some public order punishment—detention for a few days and a fine. It wouldn't be a big problem.

Chen Zizhuang said: "Mengliang, there's something you don't know. Zhanruo and Huang Xiyin already had a grudge. Though Huang Xiyin isn't an Australian official now, I've heard he voluntarily went over to the Australians and became a councillor to the Nanhai County Magistrate. The new County Magistrate Zhang is a true... true Australian. Huang Xiyin sees him daily. I'm worried Huang Xiyin will use his personal grudge for revenge, and my young friend may meet with misfortune."

Liu Dalin pondered a moment and said: "Are there other complications?"

"Well..." Chen Zizhuang hesitated slightly, then said: "Mengliang is perceptive; nothing escapes you. There is another reason. That day, Zhanruo also wrote a 'sentimental poem' on the outer wall of Zunxin Pavilion. The language was... not very appropriate for the times."

Now Liu Dalin was less certain. Though the Senate in Qiongzhou hadn't conducted any literary inquisitions or similar nonsense, and had never bothered disputing classics with Ming scholars, after taking control of Guangzhou they had indeed made examples of quite a few gentry. The reasons were legitimate enough—tax evasion, kidnapping and mutilating people for gain—things Australians absolutely wouldn't tolerate. As for "seditious poetry," if they wanted to punish troublesome former-dynasty remnants, it wouldn't be impossible. Ultimately, it depended on the political situation within the Senate.

But to ease Chen Zizhuang's mind, Liu Dalin still consoled him: "Jisheng, don't worry. Based on my understanding of the Senate, they've always governed by law. They wouldn't punish someone merely for speech."

"Then I'll trouble Mengliang." Chen Zizhuang clasped his hands.

"Jisheng speaks too formally. I'll certainly do my best," Liu Dalin said.

He suddenly recalled what Zhang Xiao had said to him aboard the *Nemesis Bane*, feeling it necessary to give a word of advice. He added: "I have something to say—I don't know whether I should speak or not."

Everyone looked at each other. It was He Wuzhou, smooth as ever, who said: "We're all brothers of hometown and school. Whatever Mengliang has to say is surely for our benefit. Speak freely."

Liu Dalin said: "All present have received generations of favor from the former dynasty. That my elder brothers' hearts still turn toward the Great Ming is only proper, and none can find fault with it. But in my humble opinion, the Great Ming is now like the sun setting in the west—its mandate is exhausted. Though my elder brothers are mindful of the former dynasty's grace and unwilling to serve the Senate, I only hope you will not become their enemies. This would be a blessing for the people—a fortune for all living things."
