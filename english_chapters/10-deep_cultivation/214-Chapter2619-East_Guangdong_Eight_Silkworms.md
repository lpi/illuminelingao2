# Chapter 2619: East Guangdong Eight Silkworms

Zhao Hening walked up to him and asked, "Little Brother, how do you sell mulberry leaves?"

Guan Zongbao said, "Seven mace of silver per *dan*."

Zhao Hening clicked her tongue, "Not cheap."

Seeing she thought it expensive, Guan Zongbao said, "Sister, this is the market price. If lacking cash silver for turnover, you can withdraw some mulberry leaves first. Wait until earning money after harvest, then pay back the original amount, but with an additional three percent interest."

Zhao Hening shook her head, indicating not buying. Before long, other farmers negotiated with Guan Zongbao, buying a little bit each until it was sold out. The transaction was completed in the trading room. There was a public scale in the room, held by the scale master. After the buyer and seller agreed on the price, it was handed over to the scale master for weighing. After weighing, the number was reported loudly, and a clerk calculated the transaction amount to conduct third-party confirmation of the trade. After the transaction was completed, the clerk would collect a small commission. The ratio varied everywhere.

Having sold out mulberry leaves, Guan Zongbao originally wanted to go to Jiujiang Great Market to find Australian officials to inquire about divorce. But the strange behavior of Zhao Hening's group attracted his attention. Ancient rural areas were usually extremely closed. Even though Jiujiang was located on a thoroughfare with developed commerce, the vast majority of villagers never left the twenty-*li* radius of the village they lived in all their lives. Essentially, it was still an acquaintance society. People within ten miles and eight villages basically knew each other. But these few people before him were unfamiliar faces, only asking for various news in the Mulberry Market without intention to buy mulberries.

Although they spoke Cantonese Mandarin (*Guangfu Guanhua*), they were obviously not locals.

At this time, someone recognized Le Ziren. After all, having been a resident police officer in Jiujiang Great Market for two years, locals who had been to the market had some impression of him more or less.

"Officer Le, how come you have time to go down to the countryside for patrol today?"

"So it's Old Liu. Catching thieves and patrolling, maintaining order is my duty. I received great grace from the Senate, dare not slack off." Le Ziren said, "Have there been strangers appearing in the village recently?"

Old Liu said, "Rest assured, Officer Le. If strangers enter or exit, this small one will definitely report immediately. These two appearing unfamiliar with the Officer, are they Officer's relatives?" Le Ziren followed his words and said, "Yes, distant relatives. My distant cousin and her husband prepare to open a shop in the Great Market. Having time today, just took them around to look, seeing if there are any business opportunities."

"Oh oh, so they are Officer Le's relatives. No wonder dignified in appearance, truly a pair of Golden Boy and Jade Girl." Old Liu piled smiles on his face and flattered.

Old Liu exchanged pleasantries with Le Ziren for a while. After he left, Zhao Hening pinched Le Ziren's back and questioned, "Who is your cousin? Who is my husband?"

Hearing Zhao Hening's coquettish tone, Zhang Jiayu maintained calm on his face, but a deer rampaged in his chest (heart beat fast).

Le Ziren hurriedly begged for mercy, whispering, "Miss Zhao, I am wronged. Chief Li specially instructed me to adapt to circumstances, not exposing your identities. Country folks have long tongues, can't keep things. Anything happening, the whole village knows in half a day. Isn't this me adjusting to circumstances?"

Zhao Hening rolled her eyes at Le Ziren, actually feeling a bit happy in her heart, but still crossed her arms over her chest and said, "Forget it, too lazy to bicker with you."

Guan Zongbao saw all this in his eyes. Although the conversation between Le Ziren and Zhao Hening was very quiet, Old Liu confirmed this person was the resident police officer of the Great Market. No wonder he looked somewhat familiar. Then, the other two unfamiliar faces were mostly officials from Guangzhou. The leader was obviously this little sister who could make the resident police officer respectful. People said Australians had many female officials under them; seeing today, truly not false.

Guan Zongbao walked up to Zhao Hening and asked, "Little Sister, I see you only care about inquiring news, never buying a little mulberry leaves. Are you wanting to learn silkworm raising?"

Zhao Hening answered conveniently, "Yes, this little woman heard Jiujiang is the hometown of sericulture. Silkworms, silk, and silk fabrics are all incomparable elsewhere. Just intending to come here to ask for advice. Learning well, easier to find a good husband's family in the future."

Guan Zongbao glanced at Le Ziren and said, "This gentleman looks very familiar. Just now someone called him Officer Le. I guess he must be an official of the Great Market. Since Sister is the Official's relative, if trusting me, might as well go to my house. My Mom is proficient in the silkworm industry and surely can answer doubts for Sister."

Zhao Hening looked at Zhang Jiayu, seeming to seek his opinion. Zhang Jiayu nodded slightly. This place was not far from the Great Market. before leaving, the Chief issued a hand cannon (pistol) to Zhao Hening. With him and Le Ziren together, there wouldn't be too much danger.

"Mom, I'm back!" Guan Zongbao put down the empty load and shouted into the house, "Look who I brought?"

Huang *Shi* had just fed mulberry leaves. Hearing the voice, she came out, seeing two men and one woman coming back with Guan Zongbao. The woman looked fifteen or sixteen. Although dressed simply, her appearance was very beautiful. Don't know whose family had the fortune to give birth to such a beauty. Beside her followed a handsome young man, looking like a scholar. In sharp contrast was the other man, dark-skinned, lean in figure but appearing burly and powerful.

"This is?" Huang *Shi* didn't quite understand. Her son said going to the Great Market; how come he returned home so quickly.

"Mom, this is Officer Le of the Great Market. I met him at the Mulberry Market. He has a relative wanting to learn silkworm raising, so I brought them back."

"Ah, it's Officer Le. Please sit quickly, please sit..." Huang *Shi* was somewhat clumsy. She hadn't dealt with officials in her life. She hurriedly took out two small stools from the house. This was the few furniture in her home.

Seeing not enough stools, Le Ziren gave them to Zhao Hening and Zhang Jiayu, and sat on a medium-sized stone himself. Huang *Shi* was somewhat embarrassed and said, "Sorry, Officer, no extra stools at home."

Guan Zongbao took out a few pottery bowls from the house, scooped cold water from the vat to serve, and served some dried fruits on the small table outside the house, inviting apologetically, "Home is simple, no tea water. If you are thirsty, drink some cold water first."

Zhao Hening shook the marching canteen she carried and said, "Brother Guan, no need to be polite. We brought water."

Le Ziren said, "Auntie, this cousin of mine wants to learn Jiujiang's method of silkworm raising."

Huang *Shi* said, "Little Sister looks like an intelligent person at first glance. My little skill will be learned in no time."

Zhao Hening smiled and asked, "Auntie, where do you buy your silkworm seeds?"

"All local silkworm seeds. Sister truly has a pair of wise eyes. Whether a crop of silkworms is good or not, the relationship with silkworm seeds is too big." Huang *Shi* praised, "Silk from various places nearby has pros and cons. Poshan raw silk has long threads; silk fabrics spun from Longjiang silk threads are good. But Longjiang silkworm seeds are all purchased from Jiujiang, so they can reel good silk threads. This is not a difference in women's skills, but water colors are different."

So-called "water colors" being different meant silkworm seeds were different. Zhao Hening had considerable experience in this, but she pretended not to understand and continued to ask, "Oh? Do you keep silkworm seeds yourselves?"

"Mostly don't keep. There are specialized Seed Makers locally, specializing in silkworm seeds. Silkworm raising households all buy from Store Families."

"Oh, why not keep seeds yourselves?"

Seeing she asked common sense questions, Huang *Shi* thought she had never raised silkworms, so explained, "Little Sister doesn't know. Raising Silkworm Flower (seeds) environment is different from raising silkworms. There are two types of seed keeping. One is upper crop keeping seeds for lower crop use; this is the main silkworm seed of the year. Second is Over-Year Seed, for use next year. For First Crop Silkworms, families often practice themselves. If relatives and friends know they raised well, they come upon hearing news to book, called 'Number Paper' (*Hao Zhi*). If second crop, third, fourth, fifth, sixth crops, all belong to Store Families for buying and selling. Regarding the reason, the method of bathing in water is difficult, and buying seeds is also difficult. Need to see if silkworms suffer from diseases before they can be used as seeds. If suffering various diseases, the next crop will roughly be not good. Therefore, there is the title of Silkworm Master."

Zhao Hening knew the saying of "East Guangdong Eight Silkworms." Within a year, eight crops of silkworms could be raised. Yield was far higher than Jiangnan area. Every year from March to September, that is from Pure Brightness to Frost Descent, six crops of silkworms could be raised, called Regular Crops (*Zheng Zao*). The seventh crop raised in September and October was called Cold Crop (*Han Zao*). Before Regular Crops, there was a crop specifically producing silkworm seeds to supply Regular Crop production, called Silkworm Seed Crop. Listening to Huang *Shi*, First Crop Silkworms were generally self-kept seeds, not yet professionally produced, showing local sericulture division of labor was incomplete, and marketization degree still waited for improvement.

"What is difficult about the method of bathing in water?" Zhao Hening asked.

Huang *Shi* said, "My maiden family relatives include seed makers; I also understand a little. After mother moths fall into the grid and lay eggs on silkworm paper, put silkworm paper in the seed bathing wooden frame. Seed makers prepare hot water, probe with hand, then pour down hot water, cover and move left and right, just like bathing. After three or four times, hang in a cool and ventilated place, let it dry slowly. After bathing, take for acceptance inspection at *Wei* hour (1-3 PM) that day. If egg skin turns light red, it is proper. Inspect again the second day; it should be shrimp meat red. Inspection methods for following days are all different. By *Chen* hour (7-9 AM) on the eighth day, all silkworm babies will come out."

According to Zhao Hening's experience, what Huang *Shi* said should be a kind of High Temperature Water Bath Method for screening silkworm seeds. Jiangnan used Lime Water Bath Seed. This kind of manual method relied heavily on the operator's experience, so only professional seed makers could produce good seeds. Professional seed makers would look for better silkworm seeds, discard diseased silkworm cocoons, intentionally leaving excellent varieties to put on the market. If keeping seeds by oneself from self-raised silkworms, silkworm quality easily became uneven. Unsatisfactory silkworm crops would continue to affect the next crop, forming a vicious reproduction.

"What is the difference between the two types of kept seed silkworms?" Zhao Hening asked again.

"The first crop raises Big Silkworms, also called Big Crop Silkworms, maturing once a year. Small Silkworms mature every month, also called Monthly Rotation Silkworms. Over-Year Seeds need to keep Big Crop seeds in early summer, and Monthly Rotation seeds in July. After collection, just hang between half walls, or seal with dry bamboo tubes, no seed bathing, then can be preserved for a long time."

Zhao Hening nodded. This was the current silkworm seed combination of Guangzhou Prefecture. "East Guangdong Eight Silkworms" didn't refer to a single variety maturing eight times a year, but a variety combination mode with year as unit. The "Yongjia Eight Silkworms" recorded in *Qimin Yaoshu* was a variety combination of at least Ruanzhen Silkworm, Hanzhen Silkworm, and Zhe Silkworm. While in the Jiajing period, locals adopted a combination of two to four silkworms. Only until the Wanli period did the new combination fix as Big Crop and Monthly Rotation seeds.
