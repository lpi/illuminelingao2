# Chapter 2747: The Capital (Part 99)

Manager Shen burst into loud laughter. Manager Qin joined with a few dry laughs, but the expected uproar didn't materialize. He vaguely sensed something was wrong and could only soldier on: "Pipe dreams, pipe dreams..." He laughed several more times.

But the hall remained utterly silent. After a long pause, Manager Cao finally said: "Manager Leng makes a point. But word outside is that Delong is on the brink. If you're borrowing with Delong notes, I'm afraid the peers can't accept that..."

"Manager Leng," Qiao Wannian suddenly interjected, "everyone says you're on the brink. Lending to you at this time—no house can justify it. If you can't hold on and collapse, won't these borrowed notes become waste paper?"

Manager Shen exhaled in relief. Finally someone was backing him up. They'd all been playing dead until now!

Leng Ningyun said, "If Delong really does get run into the ground, having this waste paper may prove worth its weight in gold someday. It might even be a protective talisman."

These words sent a chill through the hall. Everyone mulled the meaning.

Before this, their greatest concern had been Delong's backing. Now they suddenly realized: Delong's biggest backer was the Short-Hairs!

Everyone tacitly acknowledged Delong's Short-Hair connections, but the Short-Hairs seemed so far from the capital that they couldn't really affect them.

Now, thinking again—the Short-Hairs might not reach the capital, but if things got ugly, dealing with the few of them wouldn't be difficult. Whatever Leng Ningyun's status among the Short-Hairs, crushing Delong would cost them at least two or three hundred thousand taels.

However rich the Short-Hairs were, they wouldn't consider two or three hundred thousand insignificant...

And thinking about his safe return—that probably wasn't something a few escort masters could have managed.

Manager Shen forced a sneer: "Nonsense! Utterly absurd!"

Logically speaking, Leng Ningyun's words were indeed preposterous—truly "nonsense." Yet coming from him at this moment, there was nothing laughable about them.

But in the hall, no one else spoke. Qiao Wannian nervously sniffed his snuff. Somehow it tickled his nose—he let out a tremendous sneeze.

The sneeze broke the awkward silence. Manager Yuan suddenly said: "We're all peers—by reason, we should lend a hand." He slowly rose from his seat. "Our humble shop has limited resources and tight funds. We can't provide timely help. But how about this—we still have about twelve thousand taels in Delong notes. Consider that our loan to Manager Leng. These were issued by Delong originally—Manager Leng surely won't disdain them."

"Most appreciated." Leng Ningyun rose and bowed.

Manager Shen grew extremely anxious. Though Manager Yuan's words sounded fine, he was actually withdrawing from the run. Moreover, most of those twenty-odd thousand taels in Delong notes had been bought cheap—his actual cost was under three thousand taels.

He was about to speak when Manager Cao also hesitantly said: "Ah, this is difficult. Our shop also has over ten thousand in Delong notes. We were worried something might happen! Since Manager Leng is taking responsibility, let our Delong notes count as a loan too—please don't disdain them, Manager Leng."

"How could I disdain notes from my own shop?" Leng Ningyun smiled. "Thank you, Manager Shen, for supporting our humble establishment."

With these two leading, the others followed, pledging ten or twenty thousand each, all using Delong notes as loans. Roughly calculated, it came to nearly ninety thousand taels. Leng Ningyun was secretly astonished: These Shanxi fellows had really come prepared! Without this visit, when they opened tomorrow, just redeeming these notes would have put him in dire straits.

Thank goodness for the Senate... In that instant, Leng Ningyun fully appreciated the care from Lingao. Though time was short and he didn't yet know exactly what the Foreign Intelligence Bureau and Reconnaissance Division had done, the results were outstanding.

Thinking of this, his mood improved even more. He turned his gaze to Managers Shen and Qin.

Though there was no direct evidence, from Manager Shen's behavior, he was clearly implicated in this affair.

Now, somewhat teasingly, he said: "I wonder what Managers Shen and Qin think?"

Manager Shen could never have imagined this. What had seemed a sure thing had taken such an enormous turn! He almost suspected everyone had been hexed—or had taken some drug from Leng Ningyun. He was about to jump up and denounce them when Manager Qin tugged his sleeve and whispered: "Don't rush! Something's strange!"

These words snapped Manager Shen back to reality. Leng Ningyun had no drugs, and they weren't hexed. Rather, they must have made some private deal beforehand! Maybe this gang had already sold him out!

Manager Shen's hands and feet went cold. For a moment, he couldn't think of what to say. Numbly, he heard Manager Qin beside him saying: "I've also got over ten thousand in Delong notes. Forget the interest..."

The banquet lasted until the second watch before dispersing. There was plenty of entertainment—songs and dances, pretty boys and girls serving wine. Everyone enjoyed themselves thoroughly, all except Manager Shen, who had no appetite and no interest in the beauties beside him. He barely endured until the party ended. The madam arranged his favorite girl to stay the night, but Manager Shen had no desire left. He forced himself to exchange pleasantries with his peers and was about to leave when, in the foyer, Leng Ningyun suddenly blocked his path.

"Manager Shen, how is Manager Qiao of your shop doing? He's from the Pingyao Qiao family after all. If you don't look after him and something happens, you might have trouble explaining, don't you think?"

Manager Shen said through gritted teeth: "Whether I can explain is none of your business!"

"So, he's had an accident?"

Manager Shen looked stunned. He said in a low voice, "What nonsense!" With that, he no longer bothered sparring with Leng Ningyun. He hurried into his sedan and called out, "Back to the shop!"

When Leng Ningyun returned to the residence, Wu Kaidi bowed in congratulations. "Master, you truly are a great talent! A few words brought them all to heel!"

"Not at all, not at all," Leng Ningyun changed clothes and washed his hands in the copper basin a maid brought, then took a towel to dry them. "How could I have such ability? Tough talk requires capital. First, the Senate now commands respect across the seas—they have to consider their future. Second, the Special Reconnaissance Team probably gave them a bit of a shock these past few days."

"I can't imagine how formidable this Special Reconnaissance Team is..." Wu Kaidi was practically prostrating in admiration. "Someday I'd really like to witness them with my own eyes."

"There'll be opportunity." Leng Ningyun smiled. "Go call everyone."

"You two assistant managers—first thing tomorrow morning, take these two lists to each Shanxi House to collect payment. Bring plenty of escorts and guards."

Though Xiao and Wei had shown "full confidence" in public, they actually had no idea what would happen after opening on the sixth. Now, taking the lists and seeing the figures, their faces lit up with surprise and some disbelief.

"Master! Is this real?" Assistant Manager Xiao ventured to ask.

"Of course it's real. These are the amounts each manager personally agreed to at the banquet last night. Go handle it quickly. I've set the opening for the eighth, and tomorrow the notices must be posted."

Though no notes had been exchanged on the spot, in business, a word was a bond—no one would renege on what was said publicly.

Assistant Manager Wei said, "All Delong notes? These two lists together are almost 100,000 taels!"

"That's what they said."

"Goodness, they nearly swept all the Delong notes off the market! If they'd rushed us all at once tomorrow, we'd have been finished..." Assistant Manager Wei said. "There are probably some notes from out of town too. If it were just normal local transactions, at most half this amount."

"When you think about it, this was their once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Without such a major crisis, how could they have gathered so many Delong notes so quickly? All bought at thirty, forty, even twenty percent of face value. Many of our customers suffered losses, maybe even lost everything!" Leng Ningyun sighed. "We bear some responsibility for this."

"Those who sold Delong notes lost faith in us. They deserved their losses." Assistant Manager Xiao was dismissive.

"You can't say that. We in finance all have our disclaimer scripts, and the sums we handle are so large that we easily forget money is money. That won't do! We're using customers' money, earning from customers' sweat. Though profit and loss are daily business, we mustn't take money lightly."

Assistant Manager Wei looked at the lists several times and said quietly, "Xia's isn't on here..."

"If they're not, they're not. One house alone can't make big waves." Leng Ningyun was unconcerned.

"We originally had 150,000. Eunuch Yang will withdraw 100,000 tomorrow, leaving 50,000. Mr. Li gave us another 30,000—so 80,000 taels ready for immediate payment." Chief Accountant Liu calculated. The total borrowed from the peers came to 120,000 taels. Though all in Delong notes that couldn't be used for exchange, it at least eliminated equivalent liquidity, sharply reducing the run pressure Delong faced.

"...Calculating this way, even if there's a run after we open, our current reserves are more than enough. Our outstanding notes are only about 300,000. Now 120,000 have returned; Eunuch Yang's withdrawal tomorrow returns another 100,000. The remainder, even if everyone demands payment, is only 100,000."

When Chief Accountant Liu finished, everyone present showed expressions of relief. Though Leng Ningyun had been encouraging them, with occasional "good news," the capital shortage was undeniable. Now Manager Leng had pulled teeth from the tiger's mouth, forcing Shanxi Houses to lend such a sum. Delong was safe.

After everyone dispersed, Wu Kaidi still worried. He asked, "Master, Manager Shen of Xia's wouldn't lend money. Could that mean..."

"You're right. He's deeply involved in this affair. I probed him about Manager Qiao today, and his face changed completely. In my view, Manager Qiao has probably been silenced."
