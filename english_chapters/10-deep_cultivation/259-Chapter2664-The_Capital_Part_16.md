# Chapter 2664: The Capital (Part 16)

The clattering of horse hooves shattered the silence of the early morning. The figures of several riders emerged from the morning mist, riding towards Beijing.

Liao Sanniang rode at the front. Her body was soft and resilient. She held the reins with her left hand, keeping her upper body perpendicular to the horse's spine. Her body moved in a gentle rhythm with the horse's movement, forming a seamless tacit understanding between human and horse.

Liao Sanniang loosened the reins, the weight in her left hand disappearing. The horse lowered its head and neck, indicating she had given up control, allowing the horse to walk leisurely along the road.

Liao Sanniang raised her right hand and touched her upright collar. There was a small bulge at the corner of the collar—a deadly poison pill that she could bite into just by lowering her head. A woman captured would face torture a hundred times more painful than a man. A woman who had rolled through the thicket of knives and spears never begrudged death. Indifference to death stopped the Reaper; the blood on the blade was always someone else's.

Raising her head slightly, she was somewhat lost in thought. Counting from Master Leng's disappearance, a day and a half had passed. Liao Sanniang had only slept for a few hours in between, spending the rest of the time rushing about inside and outside the city. She scattered manpower and contacted the local heavyweights in the villages and counties along several main roads around the capital, mainly the runners and bailiffs in various places. These low-level public servants controlled the public power of local investigation and security management and could control the idlers and "White Catchers" who helped the government offices locally. They had great energy for local activities. The focus was to check for Boss Leng's horses—horses were large targets, seen by many, and easy to identify. Starting with these, the possibility of achieving a breakthrough was greater.

Li Rufeng remained in Beijing to manage relations with all parties and handle the ransom letter and middleman that might arrive at any time. In this male-dominated society of the Great Ming, people always trusted men more.

Deep down, Liao Sanniang didn't have much hope for the investigation. These civilians bought by money and goods often reported false or exaggerated information to claim credit and rewards; most of what they provided was useless. From the kidnappers' perspective, abandoning the carriage but reluctant to part with the horses left the biggest clue. However, horses were different from carriages; their mobility was much higher. They could take the main roads, small paths, or even go cross-country. The loopholes were as many as mesh eyes. Like the assistant managers, there wasn't much Liao Sanniang could do, but she couldn't think too much. If her heart panicked, she couldn't get things done.

Since Liao Sanniang came to Beijing, she had felt a faint unease. The farther from Guangzhou, the more severe the decay of the Australian Song's influence.

The Beijing Station was the most unique existence among all overseas stations, and also the one with the faintest Australian Song color.

The Capital, the political center of the Great Ming, was full of spies, with the Factory and Guard everywhere. All unconventional behaviors meant treason and heresy. Once out of tune with this city, the Beijing Station would immediately become the brightest target.

Invested in the isolated Beijing Station, for the sake of cover, except for retaining the financial system due to work docking needs, whether Heliansheng, Delong, or the Leng residence, all Australian Song customs were changed to follow the Great Ming etiquette and law. Furthermore, they used as few Naturalized Citizen employees as possible; almost all employees in unimportant positions were recruited locally or nearby. They were managed completely according to the feudal society's ethical code, restrained mainly by contracts, shop rules, family laws, and official laws. This caused the few dispatched personnel from Lingao to undergo rapid reverse assimilation, reverting to the living habits of the Great Ming.

The so-called rules Li Rufeng spoke of had actually never been strictly observed. Even in modern times, lacking supervision and instant communication tools, relying solely on employees' self-discipline would lead to the neglect of rules and regulations. In the Beijing Station with its strong feudal color, rigid regulations often could not adapt to the complex and ever-changing situation. Flexibility became the norm, and various Lingao rules and regulations became mere scraps of paper under repeated accommodations. What could actually be enforced was the simple and crude feudal family law.

Liao Sanniang had heard complaints from other dispatched personnel: if an overseas station had only one Senator in charge, it would inevitably be a "One Word Hall," often engaging in little tricks of "outward devotion and inner opposition," like "when the general is abroad, he may not accept the sovereign's orders." Some "rule-breaking" matters even caused security incidents later. These had all entered the relevant training materials.

Master Leng was the rule-maker. All rules of the Beijing Station were used to manage others. Temporary changes regarding security and travel routes were often decided by Master Leng himself—this made Li Rufeng's talk about rules sound more like excuses and shirking responsibility after an accident.

Master Leng would kneel and kowtow to the big shots of the court, but within the Beijing Station, Master Leng was the absolute leader, possessing irrefutable authority. What he said went; no one dared to question him.

As for his character, Liao Sanniang admired him quite a bit. Like most Senators, he didn't have the cold ruthlessness of those from wealthy families but was rather upright and kind. On ordinary days, he neither indulged in lust nor had much interest in amusement and feasting. He was fair in the personnel and official affairs of the Beijing Station and was an expert in business. However, Liao Sanniang always felt that in the bones of this Master Leng, there were certain factors of unwillingness to be lonely. On the surface, he lived a disciplined life in the Beijing Station, responding carefully to everything around him. But there was always some impulse to "do big things."

He was very easygoing and often joked with employees from Lingao. When teasing the dispatched Senators to Liao Sanniang, Master Leng once said: The Senate treats dispatched Senators like buying a lottery ticket, and winning five million every day, continuing to win for ten years. After all, what dispatched Senators faced was never just enemies from all sides, but more so various human disasters, natural calamities, diseases, and countless unpredictable accidents in chaotic times.

The greatness of the Senate was not worth a laugh in front of nature's heavenly might. Running around in chaotic times under simple conditions of security, hygiene, and disaster prevention, ten years without accidents of death, disability, or disappearance of dispatched Senators—this itself was a miracle enough for the Senate to be proud of. Although many times it relied on the favor of fate, under the excitement of result-oriented thinking and personal adventurism to realize personal value, many problems were temporarily covered by the brilliance of various overseas achievements.

While enjoying luck, they were also constantly accumulating random variables.

Liao Sanniang didn't understand what a lottery ticket was, but she could roughly guess it was a gambling game. The special, slightly chaotic management system of the Beijing Station had a large number of loopholes. The Beijing Station was a special team built according to local conditions. In the post-Ming era initiated by the Northern Expedition, the retention of the Beijing Station increasingly became a focus of controversy. On one hand, the development of the Beijing Station's financial, industrial, and commercial businesses was highly effective; on the other hand, it contradicted the original purpose of keeping a low profile and hiding. With the increase in Australian goods sales and increased contact with high-level clients for savings and loans, Boss Leng's fame grew, and as exposure increased, risks increased accordingly.

Should it be completely abolished or taken over entirely by indigenous employees? All parties were still studying and deliberating. Liao Sanniang had no right to gossip, nor could she say much of substance, but she saw some signs that the Beijing Station was likely to be downsized, or rather, to go underground, and Master Leng was likely to return to Guangzhou.

Master Leng mocked the Senate's gambling on dispatched issues, but he himself remained the same, still placing personal orders above the Beijing Station's system without any change, and feeling it was only right.

Other people from Lingao also perceived something more or less, and they would whisper and discuss it among themselves in their spare time.

The *Great Ming Law* lists Ten Abominations; the first three are Conspiracy of Rebellion, Conspiracy of Great Sedition, and Conspiracy of Treason. Beyond the Five Punishments, there is *Lingchi*, used for those guilty of Great Sedition and Treason. Being in an enemy country, the confusion about the road ahead and the fear of the extreme punishment of fish-scale slicing made people's hearts extremely fragile. The employees from Lingao were full of anxiety and insecurity. In this moment of hanging uncertainty and swaying, Senator Leng's kidnapping might become the last straw to break the camel's back. Human hearts are subtle; a momentary shaking in one person's mentality could push everyone into the abyss.

All of Liao Sanniang's posturing was for stability. People must see that things were progressing. Until someone from Lingao arrived or the situation changed, Liao Sanniang and Li Rufeng had no way of retreat and could only persist.

Liao Sanniang withdrew her mind, looked at the winding road extending before her, and whispered to herself, "Keep walking forward."

Returning to Delong, the outside of the main gate was deserted, without the imagined crowd of people coming for a run on the bank. Instead, there were seven or eight Shuntian Prefecture bailiffs guarding the street. A notice stamped with the Shuntian Prefecture seal had already been pasted on the spirit screen. It seemed Wu Kaidi had persuaded the government to temporarily seal the bank.

She did not go to the front but detoured to the back alley. After seven turns and eight bends, she knocked open a small door in an inconspicuous narrow alley and returned to Delong.

Tea smoke curled up. The hot tea gradually warmed Liao Sanniang's body. Looking at Li Rufeng through the tea smoke, she found that this man who was always energetic seemed somewhat listless too.

Liao Sanniang held the cup with both hands, smiled gently, and said, "Why does the Chief Escort torture yourself and be so anxious?"

Li Rufeng sat in the round-backed armchair, rubbed his head, and said, "I originally thought fighting and killing were the most dangerous, but now I know that idling like this and waiting is the most torturous."

Liao Sanniang smiled and said, "Do you want me to ask for a string of prayer beads for the Chief Escort, so you can recite the Heart-Calming Mantra to correct your mind?"

Li Rufeng smiled bitterly and said, "I have been hot-tempered all my life. I don't want to eat vegetarian food and chant Buddha's name; I only want to kill people refreshingly. It's a pity I can't touch the bandits' tracks."

Liao Sanniang asked, "Is there news from Guangzhou?"

Li Rufeng scratched his head with a cracking sound and replied, "Soon. It is said they are transmitting via the telegraph box, relaying one leg after another. It will be faster than relay horses. But such heavy weapons of the state are not available everywhere."

Just as the two were speaking, a person suddenly burst in from outside the entrance hall. It was Little Bazi. Waving an envelope in his hand, he shouted loudly, "It's here! It's here! The ransom note is here!"

Li Rufeng and Liao Sanniang stood up at the same time with a whoosh. The two looked at each other and let out a long breath simultaneously. The big stone hanging in their hearts finally crashed to the ground.
