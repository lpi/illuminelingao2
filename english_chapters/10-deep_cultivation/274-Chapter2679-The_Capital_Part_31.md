# Chapter 2679: The Capital (Part 31)

"So it is a token." Liu Sha carefully put away the folding fan.

"Your Excellency walks the *Jianghu* as a person outside the secular world; do you have a religious name?"

"Don't have a religious name yet." Liu Sha scratched his head. "But I have a nickname, called 'Liu Mutou' [Liu Wood/Blockhead]."

Wang Yehao laughed *puchi* hearing this: "It happens to correspond to the order of Five Elements. 'Jinshi' [Metal-Stone] is already in the residence; your Excellency shall be called 'Mushi Daoist' [Wood-Stone Daoist] from now on."

"Thank the Master for bestowing the name." Liu Sha bowed with cupped hands.

"You presumably know that my residence does not lack people to use. The reason for using you also has a cause."

"Yes, this small one understands!"

"Don't break your past relationships with those brothers in the Yamen and outside."

Liu Sha knew what this Master Wang fancied was his network in the *Zhenfusi*. It seemed this Master Wang's plot was not small. However, as long as it wasn't rebellion, it didn't matter what he did. Having worked in the *Zhenfusi* for many years, he could be counted as "bold" and "careful." He knew that as long as one didn't stand in the wrong line, acting recklessly was actually an advantage.

"Yes, entirely at the Master's orders."

"Good." Wang Yehao beckoned the other party forward and instructed in a low voice, "Go find a house in the city; it must be remote and quiet. Settle the two maids there."

"Master, is this?" Liu Sha was full of suspicion. Judging by the situation just now, it didn't look like hiding a beauty in a golden house.

"No need to ask more. Just get it done; there will be plans in the future."

"This small one understands."

After instructing the matters, Wang Yehao didn't let Liu Sha leave but pulled out a booklet from the compartment of the desk and asked: "Do you recognize the incantations in the booklet?"

Before returning the notebook with the code to Mr. Zhou, Wang Yehao had secretly copied a version. For the past year, whenever he was free, he would secretly take it out to study, but unfortunately, he never found the gateway.

Liu Sha flipped through it for half a day and could only shake his head: "Forgive my shallow talent; I haven't learned this kind of incantation."

"No clue at all?"

"There are thousands of spell methods in the world; every sect has secret arts not passed down. I wonder where the Master got this book. If the sect is known, perhaps I can find someone to interpret one or two."

"Speaking of it, it was really a coincidence. This Official also doesn't know which sect this object belongs to. If you don't know, then treat it as if this Official never asked about this matter. Do not mention it again." Wang Yehao put the booklet away again. "Go to the accounting room to collect one hundred taels of silver and go handle the affairs."

Liu Sha answered "Nuo" and stood up to leave.

Wang Yehao looked at "Wood Stone" leaving, thoughtful. Recruiting more manpower certainly helped, but the household expenses also increased. Especially in the last two years, to grasp the direction in the treacherous court situation, he spent a large amount of money. Although he collected quite a bit when he was the Imperial Commissioner in Guangdong, balancing the big account showed a significant loss.

The Wang family could be considered a family of officials for generations, but in these recent two generations, not many served as officials, and there wasn't much accumulation of family wealth. He himself had been a capital official for a long time and hadn't been posted outside. Therefore, he cared quite a bit about "opening sources" [increasing income].

However, there was no one with a business mind in the family. The contributions from merchants could only be fixed filial respects, plus land rent income. Compared to common people, it was naturally affluent, but it was far from being wealthy. When chatting idly with Immortal Zhou, they also talked about the Art of *Tao Zhu* [Business]. Immortal Zhou was very arrogant, saying as long as the Universe Mirror was in hand, he could touch stone into gold. Any amount of silver would be no problem.

This Universe Mirror seemed to exist yet not exist, so naturally one couldn't count on it for sure. However, Immortal Zhou did mention a few businesses.

One was making wine. The area of Shaoxing was originally famous for making wine, and the Wang family also had a small winery. But making wine required good water. In Shaoxing, the best water to use was Jianhu Lake water. But the lake water was limited, and many wineries used it. The Wang family's winery couldn't monopolize it.

The areas of Shaoxing, Jinhua, and Dongyang had many mountains and a mild climate. There was no lack of grain for making wine or high-quality water sources. The most famous high-end yellow wine of the Great Ming, Jinhua Wine, came from this area. However, the brewing industry required a large amount of water. Water sources with both good quality and sufficient quantity were not many. Simply wanting to expand the scale of winemaking or setting up new wineries was a troublesome matter. Wang Yehao's family didn't have such talent to run around for this purpose.

Mr. Zhou's idea was different from his. The category of yellow wine had been done to death in the Great Ming; everyone from the Emperor down to the commoners drank it. Just speaking of production areas, there were many: Shanxi, Shandong, South Zhili, Zhejiang, etc., all produced yellow wine. Both taste and grade were fully occupied. So his idea was to make White Liquor—also called "Fire Wine" at that time.

But White Liquor had a spicy and stimulating taste and high alcohol content. The customer group wasn't large, mostly lower-class commoners. Especially soldiers and bottom-layer laborers were the majority. So it couldn't sell for a price. Wang Yehao sniffed at it.

But Mr. Zhou said it didn't matter. He said he had a way to brew white liquor with better taste and better grain usage that didn't test water quality too much. He also said as long as the cost was low and sales channels were wide, selling more would naturally make big money.

"Now the court uses troops in Liaodong. That covers bitter cold lands. Soldiers guarding the border, shouldn't they have a few mouthfuls of *Shao Dao Zi* [burning knife liquor] to warm their bodies? With an army of over a hundred thousand, if each person drinks half a tael or one tael a month, how much can be sold?"

Later he mentioned many other avenues for making money: matches, fragrant soap, MSG, swivel chairs, cosmetics, perfume, dyes, medicine... a total of no less than twenty or thirty kinds. He also said he wanted to build windmills and waterwheels, smelt steel, burn lime to make caustic soda... Wang Yehao listened in a fog, feeling it was all nonsense.

However, he was somewhat moved by these "nonsenses" of the Teacher. Just hearing the description of many things could move one's heart. If they were really made, would he worry about selling them?

Returning to his hometown this time, someone happened to be dumping an estate in Dongyang at a low price. The estate was located in a mountainous area. Although there wasn't much farmland, water sources were abundant, and surrounding mountain forest resources were rich. If Mr. Zhou really possessed the Art of *Tao Zhu*, operating in this place would be a suitable location. After all, once the operation flourished, someone would inevitably try to steal the secret techniques.

Therefore, he quickly spent money to buy it, making it a secret base. Except for his trusted family members, no one else knew he had a property in Dongyang.

Speaking of which, this Mr. Zhou was very interested in the techniques of investigation and secret inquiry. According to reports from Zhou Lezhi and Liu Zhao, ever since he learned Liu Zhao was a Jinyiwei investigator, he often asked Liu Zhao to tell him about the things in the Jinyiwei and the Northern *Zhenfusi*. To Liu Zhao's surprise, he knew a lot about the anecdotes and history of the Guard and the Division—let alone ordinary commoners, even low-level personnel like Liu Zhao had never heard of some of them.

Especially hearing many anecdotes that the "Immortal" knew, Wang Yehao knew that his so-called origin of going to sea with the Sanbao Eunuch and cultivating Dao after encountering danger was pure nonsense. If he really stayed overseas for so many years, how did he know these things?

Regarding investigation, this Immortal Zhou also had many unique views. Liu Zhao didn't elaborate on this, but judging from his expression, he was quite admiraing.

Unexpectedly, this Immortal really gathered strengths from many sources. Not to mention predicting the future, he also understood miscellaneous studies of hundred crafts, and even knew a thing or two about arresting and spying, even making Liu Zhao feel he was formidable. This made Master Wang understand his origin even less.

Although Immortal Zhou had vast supernatural powers and brought him many benefits, Master Wang always felt like having thorns on his back.

Don't know why, Immortal Zhou always had an indescribable temperament.

"This person is definitely not a thing of the pool [mediocrity]!" He thought secretly.

But to say he had the "Aura of a Tyrant" or the temperament of a formidable hero, that wasn't quite it either. In short, he made Master Wang feel difficult to control.

"Must have some handle." He muttered to himself.

However, this Immortal Zhou was a loner, with no family members to manipulate. The only thing he cherished was the Universe Mirror. But this Universe Mirror hadn't been found until now.

No relatives, no fields or houses, no gold, stone, calligraphy, or painting... Calculating carefully, this person had nothing. Besides being afraid of death, there was really nothing to hold him with.

Since he wanted to use him, he couldn't hold a knife to his neck all the time. Wang Yehao wasn't Zhu Yuanzhang; he knew that threatening with killing only made people slack off passively. It was absolutely impossible to make people exhaust their wisdom and energy to do the work well voluntarily.

What he could think of was using female sex to lure him. Best if they could bear him a son or a half-daughter. With his own flesh and blood, he couldn't help but be obedient.

However, although the two maids, Jieyi and Zhiling, had been with Mr. Zhou for not a short time, and according to Zhou Lezhi's report Mr. Zhou also frequently "conquered" the two maids, sometimes doing it as pastime during the day when there was nothing to do, the two had shown no signs of pregnancy.

Reasonably speaking, the two maids were in their youth, and Mr. Zhou looked only in his early thirties by appearance and body. No matter how one looked, his knees shouldn't be empty.

During this period, Master Wang also hired doctors to check pulses and regulate the bodies of the two maids secretly. According to the doctors, the two maids had no major problems with kidney yang, kidney yin, *Qi*, or blood. Although some regulating medicine was prescribed, there was not a bit of news.

One person struggling to conceive might be the woman's problem. If neither maid got pregnant, nine out of ten it was Mr. Zhou's problem.

If so, sending more women to him would be useless. He must be given body conditioning. But the person had already gone to Guangzhou.

Wang Yehao couldn't wait any longer, so he summoned Liu Sha immediately to discuss.

"Summoning you to discuss is for no other matter but Mr. Zhou," Wang Yehao sighed. "He has been in my residence for a long time and is very capable. Only his knees are empty. Although I gave him two maids, there has been no happy news..."

His words were all presentable on the table. Even if someone told Mr. Zhou, they couldn't find half a fault.

A Northern Division investigator like Liu Sha had the most exquisite heart; he understood the Master's meaning as soon as he heard it. He smiled: "Master, what difficulty is there? In the way of heirs, it's not only biological ones that can inherit the incense..."

"What you say makes sense." Master Wang nodded secretly. This Liu Sha was indeed a smart person!

"Are there suitable children? Must be reliable, with no attachments."

"If the Master has orders, this small one will just go do it," Liu Sha said. "Wonder if it should be male or female?"

"He is still young; mostly likely he will have biological flesh and blood in the future. Since it's an adopted child [*Ming Ling*], choose a girl."

"What the Master considers is extremely right."

"This matter must be secretive."

"This small one understands." Liu Sha comprehended.
