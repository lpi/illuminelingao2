# Chapter 1173 - Cutting Off the Firewood from Under the Pot

Si Kaide's gaze fell on the work reports recently delivered from various overseas stations. He remembered a report Zhao Yingong had recently sent about trying to develop a Shanghai-Tianjin maritime route. In the report, Zhao Yingong had proposed that the Great Ming's coastal shipping industry had backward technology and low efficiency. With the Senate's current maritime capabilities, even using Shanghai's local sand junks could transport large quantities of goods and accelerate north-south trade flows. The grain tribute transport sector, in particular, offered significant profits while further disrupting the Great Ming's economic foundations.

But what interested him wasn't just this matter—it was Zhao Yingong's mention of Shanghai.

As a trading port, Shanghai had important significance not only in Chinese coastal trade but was also a major foreign trade hub. Si Kaide had always wondered: why was Shanghai, as a port, less important than Fujian during the Ming Dynasty? The major foreign trade ports of the Ming, from the earliest Shuangyu and Yuegang to Anping and Xiamen in the late Ming, were without exception located along the Fujian coast.

From a trade perspective, Fujian was surrounded by mountains on three sides with little flat land. Aside from sugar and indigo, it wasn't itself a production base for major trade commodities. Many goods were transported over a thousand li from other provinces to Fujian before being exported. The "Kraak porcelain" of the early Ming had originally been fired in Jiangxi; only later, because transporting from Jiangxi to Fujian was arduous and costly, had people begun setting up kilns in Fujian for local production.

But this situation was constrained by the already declining maritime positioning and navigation technology of China at the time. Traditional Chinese maritime navigation mainly relied on "needle routes," using the compass together with coastal landmarks for sailing. Thus maritime voyages were generally conducted along island chains. Ships heading to Japan at the time all followed routes from Taiwan along the first island chain to Japan. So the sea routes to Japan had traditionally been dominated by ports in Zhejiang and Fujian provinces.

Due to declining astronomical positioning methods from the Ming onward, navigation became increasingly dependent on coastal landmark positioning. As a result, China's coastal north-south voyaging had actually regressed from the Yuan Dynasty, when ships could sail the open seas, to the Ming when travel was limited to passage among coastal islands.

The biggest problem with this route was its circuitousness. The summer route from Fujian to Japan went first to Taiwan, then rode the southeast monsoon along the Ryukyus to Nagasaki—a full 1,000 nautical miles. Departing from Shanghai, one could choose to sail in winter on the northwest monsoon, going direct to Nagasaki in only 400 nautical miles. If setting out from Shanghai, a sailing ship could reach Nagasaki in ten days. The distance was more than halved, and it avoided the typhoons common in summer.

No matter which way you looked at it, Shanghai was a port a hundred times better than Anping. Shanghai sat at the mouth of the Yangtze River, backed by the two golden waterways of the Yangtze and Grand Canal, and was itself in the most productive and prosperous region of the lower Yangtze. Whether Jiangxi porcelain, Zhejiang silk, or Songjiang cotton cloth, all could be shipped to Shanghai via convenient and cheap inland waterways. Sugar and indigo from Guangdong and Fujian could also travel by coastal routes.

If Zhao Yingong's Hangzhou Station could conduct large-scale trade with Japan, not only would this fat prize fall into the Senate's mouth, but it would fundamentally cut off any possibility of Zheng Zhilong, Li Zhilong, or other Fujian grand merchants from rebuilding their power.

This proposal had been raised long ago. Si Kaide had been tempted before, but he felt the project would be too troublesome, requiring considerable manpower and resources, and risking exacerbation of tensions with the Zheng family—it would be better to first profit from peaceful cooperation with Zheng Zhilong, then plot further later.

Now it seemed the prospect of peaceful co-optation was gone. Opening up trade with Japan from Shanghai was an inevitable step. Better to take the initiative than wait for others to propose it. At least this counted as a stratagem for "cutting off the firewood from under the pot" against the Zheng family.

Though this wasn't direct action, its strategic significance far outweighed a mere tactical raid.

Moreover, they now controlled Jeju Island as an intermediate base. Whether for ships seeking shelter and resupply or for stockpiling goods, conditions were favorable—and they could use Jeju as a base for exporting Korean and Liaodong specialties to Japan. Si Kaide knew that at the time, Korean ginseng was a "miracle drug" in Japan, more valuable than gold and still in short supply. Many Japanese maidens had sold themselves into prostitution to buy medicine for sick relatives.

Si Kaide thought: no matter how you looked at it, developing trade with Japan was urgent business. The question was: who should be sent?

After much thought, he decided to send Ping Qiusheng, recently returned from Southeast Asia, to Japan—Ping Qiusheng had been begging him for this assignment for a long time. Now Ping Qiusheng was his capable subordinate. Since his trip to Southeast Asia, he'd successfully opened trade relations with Siam. This trade route had brought the Senate large quantities of rice, alleviating their constant food shortage problems. Ping Qiusheng's reputation in the Senate had risen considerably. He'd become one of the recently emerging practical talents—and his opinions and wishes couldn't be ignored.
