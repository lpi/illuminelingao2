# Chapter 459 - Autumn Levy (Part 10)

"If Uncle is willing to take the lead, this humble nephew is ready to serve as your vanguard, running errands on your behalf," Huang Binkun said, appearing quite eager.

"Good. Then I must trouble you with this."

Huang Binkun took his leave, brimming with energy. He stood in the street for a moment to collect himself, then decided to first return to the county school to contact his fellow students. Together they could brainstorm and compose a moving and persuasive petition—that would show Liu Dalin something.

Students were all educated people who understood principles. Throughout history, scholars had been the pillars of the nation. He firmly believed the scholars of this county were such pillars.

Yet the group of examination graduates at the county school proved unenthusiastic about the matter. No matter how Huang Binkun emphasized that this concerned the entire county, most remained hesitant. Some said this was a matter for their elders and juniors shouldn't meddle. Others, upon hearing they were to submit a petition to the Australians, turned pale with fright and refused to say a word. As for those scholars from poor families, they had even less interest in this proposal—their families had no significant landholdings. In their most basic, most practical feelings: wouldn't offending the Australians mean having their stipends cut off? They had only just received this allowance, their families had finally caught their breath, their wives and children could eat a few proper meals, and with some savings, by year's end they could buy some cloth and a few *jin* of meat for a treat.

Huang Binkun talked until his lips were parched, but apart from one student named Li Xiaopeng from the county seat's Li family, he found no supporters. Let alone anyone volunteering to help draft this "petition." The Li family was also considered a "great house" in the county. His ancestors were originally from northern Anhui and had followed Zhu Yuanzhang to fight for the realm, eventually becoming a minor official here and settling down. The Li family had long been among the wealthiest in the county—not because they owned much land, but because they had held a hereditary monopoly on Lingao county seat's "night soil district."

The owner of a night soil district was responsible for removing residents' waste. Though the business sounded foul and reeking, the owner needn't do the work himself. He hired workers from among the rural peasants as waste collectors, and didn't even need to pay wages—the waste itself served as their payment. The cleaned-out waste and refuse was then sold to farmers as fertilizer. This income was not only stable but extremely profitable. In a county like Lingao with utterly undeveloped commerce and industry, this was quite a substantial business. The Li family had leveraged this into rural moneylending, accumulating considerable wealth.

With money came land. The Li family also owned about a thousand *mu* in the countryside, so the grain levy directly concerned them. Second, Li Xiaopeng bore considerable hostility toward the Australians. His family had formerly been the county's foremost wealthy household. The Gou family, though rich, couldn't flaunt it openly. But ever since the Australians arrived, several nouveaux riches had suddenly emerged—especially Lin Quan'an. Having suddenly come into wealth, he naturally had to show it off. Moreover, as the transmigrators' agent procuring various industrial and agricultural materials across the island, he had gained considerable worldly experience. In consumption and enjoyment, he had become the county's leading figure, which Li Xiaopeng found insufferable.

Li Xiaopeng was the restless type who liked to stir up trouble. He had always found studying at the county school tedious. Hearing this affair could embarrass the Australians, he immediately declared his eager support.

Li Xiaopeng's essays weren't up to much, but he had plenty of fair-weather friends. One call could gather forty or fifty people. Huang Binkun felt that though these idlers weren't particularly useful, they could at least make a show of force—rural folk were timid, and some might lose their nerve at the crucial moment.

Seeing no results at the county school, Huang Binkun decided to first canvass among the major households in town. He immediately went to Wang Ci to request leave.

Leaving the county school, he was hurrying along the street when, at the deserted corner near the Temple of Literature, he was suddenly tripped. Fortunately, he had some martial arts training and stable footing; he staggered several steps before regaining his balance. He saw a beggar sitting against the wall, disheveled and in rags. A bamboo staff lay stretched across the middle of the alley.

Because the Australians didn't permit beggars, anyone caught begging in their territory—no matter how pitiful their act or whether truly destitute—was hauled off by the constabulary. The sick were sent to the hospital for the first batch of medical students to practice on; the healthy were sent straight to a labor-reform team to work. The number of beggars in the county had dropped considerably. The remaining ones had drifted into the county seat to continue their vocation—the Australians didn't bother with this area.

Huang Binkun said angrily, "You beggar, why is your staff lying all over the place?" He wanted to kick the man a few times, but remembering he had urgent business, he didn't have time to argue with a beggar.

Yet the beggar showed no fear. He slowly withdrew the bamboo staff, and the man lifted his head slightly. On a face so grimy and black that its natural complexion was unrecognizable, his mouth actually stretched into a grin.

"Brother Binkun, how have you been?"

Huang Binkun was startled. The voice was familiar, but for a moment he couldn't place it. Looking more closely at the beggar, the filthy face was crisscrossed with several scars, quite unsightly. But the features seemed familiar. He called out uncertainly, "You are—"

"Gou Chengxuan!" The beggar smiled, a smile uglier than crying. "What, can't recognize me?"

---

"It's you?! ...How did you get back to the county seat..."

"Shh, not for others to know!" The beggar made a gesture for silence. Seeing Huang Binkun about to ask more, he said quietly, "The Fubo Shrine behind the Temple of Literature. I'm there." With that, he hunched his shoulders and fell silent again.

Huang Binkun looked around—no one passing by—and hurried away.

His heart was pounding: Gou Chengxuan had returned to Lingao!

Though the entire Gou family was notorious, Gou Chengxuan was no exception. This man was an expert at moneylending and gambling—a capable hand in the family "business." Though not necessarily virtuous, he was talented. He had even passed the county examination to become a *xiucai*. After that, the Gou family's arrogance had only grown more brazen. Gou Chengxuan seldom visited the county school—he had no interest in it, and he knew the education officials there didn't welcome him. Apart from occasional appearances to make an obligatory showing, he was rarely seen. Huang Binkun, having a poor impression of the Gou family, had never given Gou Chengxuan a friendly look.

Just the day before, he had seen a notice at the county school: the Guangdong Provincial Education Commissioner's office had issued a document to Lingao County ordering the revocation of Gou Chengxuan's *xiucai* status. Given what Gou Er and his son had done, revoking this *xiucai* was a cause for public celebration. He had only wondered why, nearly a year after the Gou family's destruction and the disappearance of Gou Er and his son, this document had suddenly arrived.

He hadn't expected Gou Chengxuan would have the audacity to sneak into the county seat! Huang Binkun's heart constricted—what was he risking everything to return for? Surely it was to take revenge on the Australians. Who would have thought Gou Chengxuan had such guts! Though he had always looked down on the man, he now couldn't help but admire his courage.

In reality, Gou Chengxuan's return to the county was out of desperation. After his father went to Lingao's mountains to seek refuge with Rotten-Eye Hu, his former sworn brother turned bandit, Gou Chengxuan had stayed hidden in Qiongshan County. At first, his father still sent letters once or twice a month; later, all communication ceased. He inquired for a long time with no news, until he finally learned from traveling merchants that Lingao was conducting bandit-suppression operations and the bandits had been swept clean.

The news sent Gou Chengxuan into a panic. First, his father's whereabouts were unknown. Second, when he and his father had fled in haste, they hadn't brought much silver. Their activities in Qiongzhou Prefecture and Guangzhou had already consumed much of it. With funds running out and the prospect of becoming street beggars looming, Gou Chengxuan had no choice but to risk returning to Lingao.

He couldn't go to his wife's family in Lingao. His relationship with his wife was poor—years ago, on a whim, seeing how pretty the daughter was, he had forcibly married her. He'd grown tired of her soon after the wedding. On D-Day itself, his wife had returned to her parents' house. If he approached his father-in-law now, they'd probably tie him up and hand him over to the Australians for beheading.

The only possibility was his mother's family. Even if they couldn't take him in, they could at least give him some silver. He just didn't know whether the Baldies had made a clean sweep and slaughtered his maternal relatives as well. Gou Chengxuan disguised himself as a beggar and slipped into Lingao. He proceeded cautiously. Reaching his maternal relatives, he approached their door under the guise of begging and finally managed to meet his kin. But he didn't dare stay—the place was surely a focus of Baldy attention, and a sudden raid would catch him like a turtle in a jar.

In the end, he decided to return to the county seat. He had heard the Baldies rarely went there; it was still much the same as before. Having been a local bully, he was intimately familiar with every corner of the county seat. Finding somewhere to hide wouldn't be hard.

But the county seat had too many people who knew him—former confederates among the clerks and runners were numerous, and these people could turn on you faster than flipping a page. They might very well sell him out. In the end, Gou Chengxuan steeled his heart and slashed several wounds across his own face, then shaved off his eyebrows entirely. These past days of fear and anxiety had already left him haggard and thin. Combined with the rough journey, his complexion was sallow. With this additional disguise, he was confident that even acquaintances couldn't recognize him at first glance. Only then did he slip into the county seat, taking up residence directly in the Fubo Shrine behind the county school. The Fubo Shrine, dedicated to Ma Yuan, was among the coldest and most neglected of the county's many "official shrines"—it didn't even have a temple keeper. Only beggars used it as a resting place.

Quite unexpectedly, there in the shrine he found the Lai brothers, who had formerly worked for his family. After the Gou family's destruction, the brothers had lost their livelihood. Having served as the Gou family's enforcers with some swagger, they found no one willing to help them when they fell on hard times—it was the classic case of everyone pushing when the wall falls. The brothers had been idlers since childhood, knowing no trade and unwilling to work for a living. They had thus become beggars.

When master and servants met, they embraced and wept. Under ordinary circumstances, Gou Chengxuan had no particular affection for these brothers. But now, as fellow outcasts, he felt much closer to them. The Lai brothers lacked sophistication; seeing their young master return, they urged him to seek revenge.
