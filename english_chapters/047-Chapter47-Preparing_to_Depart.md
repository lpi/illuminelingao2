# Chapter 47: Preparing to Depart

The moon grew gradually rounder, and headquarters' work broke from its routine rhythm. The entire organization shifted into high gear.

The Finance Department converted all liquid assets into RMB, then converted RMB into countless supplies. To guard against last-minute complications, the Finance Group still kept about 500,000 RMB on hand. They also privately cast the ten-plus kilograms of unsold gold into 10-gram, 25-gram, and 50-gram ingots ready for immediate use—not as convenient as cash, but everyone understood gold's value.

Except for maritime personnel stationed at the freight-forwarding office on the Leizhou Peninsula, all transmigrators on external assignments returned to base for final preparations.

The Medical and Health Group conducted final health reviews, focusing on immunizations. Despite numerous announcements, some people hadn't gotten vaccinated but claimed they had—some even brought forged vaccination certificates.

For certain vaccines, it was too late for catch-up doses—the complete hepatitis B series took eighteen months. The Health Group had to increase vaccine procurement.

"Don't these people know they're gambling with their lives?" Hema looked at the "Incomplete Immunization Status Report." He didn't know seventeenth-century Hainan's disease situation, but it was easy to imagine—a paradise for microorganisms. Cholera had still broken out multiple times in Hainan in the twentieth century.

"Many also haven't done the corneal incision for vision correction," Dr. Lan Fangfang said painfully. He'd had to add a complete set of old-fashioned optometry equipment to the medical supplies—compared to the ubiquitous computerized optical equipment, these were genuinely hard to find.

Many things were hard to find. The Health Group's headache was that they couldn't casually use disposable supplies like modern hospitals. Glass syringes, glass IV sets—these were now difficult to locate. Matching items like small medical autoclaves had also vanished. They'd searched many pharmaceutical companies, medical-equipment factories, and hospital warehouses to assemble everything. Specialized rubber tubing on old medical equipment had long since deteriorated; there was nowhere to source replacements, so they had to commission custom molds from manufacturers—at great expense.

The Executive Committee's attitude toward medical care was "spend without limit"—as long as it ensured the highest possible care level, they'd approve any budget. The Health Group ended up spending more than any other civilian department.

The final list could practically equip a hospital:

**1. Diagnostic Equipment**
- Gastroscope set ×1
- Ultrasound unit ×1
- X-ray machine ×1
- Colonoscope set ×1
- Laparoscope set ×1
- ECG machine ×1
- Patient monitors ×10
- Medical microscopes ×5

**2. Treatment Equipment**
- Surgical lights ×2 (1.5m diameter)
- Surgical tents ×2
- Operating tables ×2
- Oxygen cylinders ×10
- Ventilators ×10
- Gastric lavage machines ×2
- Dental treatment units ×2
- Defibrillators ×2
- Glass syringes ×100 (1ml, 5ml, 10ml, 20ml, 50ml)
- Glass IV bottles ×50 sets
- Surgical instrument sets ×20
- Dental instrument sets ×10
- Obstetric instrument sets ×5
- Orthopedic instruments and equipment ×2 sets

Each set included: electrosurgical knife ×1, pointed and rounded scalpels ×1 each, hemostatic clamps (large/medium/small) ×4 each, curved clamps ×4, hook clamps ×4, retractors (large/medium/small) ×2 each, toothed forceps (large/small) ×2 each, smooth forceps (large/small) ×2 each, intestinal spatulas (large/medium/small) ×2.

Plus surgical gowns, masks, caps, gloves, etc.

Large quantities of sutures, dressings, gauze, disinfectants, etc.

**3. Medications**
- Emergency drugs: mannitol, isoproterenol, epinephrine, norepinephrine, verapamil, cedilanid, amiodarone, propranolol, digitalis, atropine
- Large quantities of lidocaine (anesthetic)
- Large quantities of furosemide (diuretic)
- Large quantities of antibiotics (penicillin, erythromycin, clindamycin, cephalosporins, sulfonamides, ornidazole, metronidazole, meropenem, vancomycin—low to high potency)
- Large quantities of antivirals (ribavirin)
- Various common medications, vaccines, antivenoms

**4. Equipment**
Autoclaves, various stainless steel medical containers, UV disinfection carts, refrigerators, infant incubators, etc.

First-aid kits: five per person, with one issued directly as standard equipment.

If they could have found one, the Committee would have bought a field hospital. But after searching everywhere, none were available for purchase. The Committee's obsessive perfectionism about medical supplies made even the Health Group doctors intervene—they had to stop the ever-growing demands. Even a CT machine had made the procurement list; they had to explain that while useful, it wasn't essential...

As for individual equipment, the Committee's "better excessive than lacking" philosophy was fully expressed—though they did create tiered configurations based on job assignments.

**Level A (Standard)**: Personal issue for everyone.

At this level, equipment primarily met daily work and living needs, with limited protection for low-level conflicts and short-distance travel.

Knockoff USMC modular backpack (separable into 6 bags of different sizes). Regular transmigrators didn't receive camouflage—just tropical military green training uniforms and tropical combat boots. One boonie hat and one helmet-style cap each (the latter with mosquito-net face cover). Also: goggles, raincoat, and rubber wading boots.

Normally, transmigrators would sleep aboard ship or in prefab housing at base, so accommodation items didn't emphasize camping. Given Hainan's subtropical climate: 15°C-rated sleeping bags with matching ground pads.

For protection and weapons, Level-A personnel wouldn't engage in intense conflict—only limited protection needed. Issue: stab-resistant vest, gloves, and one Type-80 steel helmet. (Newer lightweight helmets weren't chosen because synthetic materials deteriorated; old Type-80s were abundant and cheap.)

Communication: walkie-talkie (1km+ range, networkable) and survival whistle.

**Personal items issued:**
- Waterproof outdoor watch (altimeter, thermometer, barometer, electronic compass, timer, alarm)
- Knockoff Swiss Army knife and short machete (1 each)
- Compass
- Headlamp
- Flashlight (friction-powered to save batteries)
- Windproof lighter
- Small steel cup (all-purpose, including morning wash)
- Outdoor canteen (effective preservation, cool color)
- Military canteen (includes mess tin—very practical)
- Mess kit, enamel plate, travel utensils (1 set each)

Finally: two days' emergency rations (energy bars and beef jerky), plus sewing kit and first-aid kit.

Toiletries and general underwear, socks, and clothing were personal responsibility.

Above Level A were **Level B** (regular soldiers, long-distance transmigrators) and **Level C** (scouts, remote field surveyors). These levels added camouflage, shells replacing training uniforms, plus more specialized outdoor and military equipment—too numerous to list. However, many Level B and C items weren't permanently issued—only distributed when needed and returned afterward.

Per Committee calculations, each transmigrator could bring 200kg of personal items, including issued equipment. No restrictions on types as long as weight was under limit—but no privately carrying firearms (any brought had to be surrendered for centralized storage).

Ma Qianzhu tirelessly led inspections of every transmigrator's packed belongings and couldn't help shaking his head. Almost everyone brought various computers, yet few thought to bring a notebook and pen. Many also packed MP3 players, PSPs, and other entertainment devices—as if their destination had power outlets everywhere. But underwear, socks, and toiletries—crucial for hygiene—were scant.

Such "hiking trip rather than time-travel" equipment was everywhere. The Committee decided to adjust everyone's gear, persuading them not to bring so much useless stuff. Rejected items could be mailed home, but most absolutely refused to leave their computers behind—even if the crossing succeeded and they all became cadre-level retirees, computers wouldn't be producible in their lifetimes.

"Forget it—let them bring them. At least we'll have more spare computer parts." Shi Kai, responsible for all IT systems, sighed. His own burden wasn't light—a full cabinet of IT equipment, and he wasn't sure his undergraduate-level skills could handle it all.

Wang Luobin and others responsible for procurement had to make more trips to nearby cities—buying all kinds of things they hadn't thought of before but realized were useful just before departure.

Packing proceeded through constant rechecking and supplementation. The commotion didn't die down until late. The next morning, transmigrators gathered on the training field, everyone in their uniformly issued clothing.

"Not bad—looks like an army now." Xi Yazhou surveyed the transmigrators sitting on the ground, waiting to board.

"Hmm. A rabble." Ma Qianzhu said glumly. Rather than an army, this scene resembled college military training redux.

"Don't say that, Old Ma." Xi Yazhou clapped his shoulder with heroic spirit. "Together, we'll sweep across all of China..."
