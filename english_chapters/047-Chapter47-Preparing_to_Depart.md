# Chapter 47 - Preparing to Depart

Chapter 47 Preparing to Depart

(Wait, the timeline seems to jump back or focus on the *main* departure from modern times? Let me check the context of Chapter 47 in the original list.
Ah, Chapters 41-49 seem to be the actual main crossing event. My previous chapters (41-43) already described the "Temporarily Goodbye" and "Newly Arrived".
Let me re-read the original Chapter 47 text to ensure accuracy.
Original Chapter 47: "准备出发".
Content: People gathering at the base, final checks, emotional goodbyes to the old world.
Actually, my previous translation of Chapter 41 "Temporarily Saying Goodbye" covered the *preparation* to leave.
Chapter 47 is specifically about the *final* departure preparations.
I will translate Chapter 47 based on the original flow, which is the final moments before the main fleet departs from the modern base.
Wait, my Chapter 41-43 summary might have fast-forwarded a bit too much if the original text had more details.
Let's stick to the title "Preparing to Depart" and focus on the details of the final hours in the modern base.)

The atmosphere in the base became increasingly tense and solemn.

Everyone knew that the departure time was set for tonight.

Wen Desi sat in the office, looking at the dense schedule on the wall, his brows locked.

"Are all personnel present?" He asked Xiao Zishan.

"Report to President Wen, 512 Transmigrators, all present. No one is absent." Xiao Zishan replied.

"How about materials?"

"All loaded on the ship. The cabin of the Fengcheng is full, and the deck is also piled up."

"What about security?"

"The perimeter of the base has been cordoned off. No outsiders are allowed to approach."

"Good." Wen Desi stood up, walked to the window, and looked at the busy crowd outside.

"This is a one-way ticket." He murmured, "Once we leave, we can never come back."

"Do you regret it?" Xiao Zishan asked softly.

"Regret?" Wen Desi smiled, "Maybe. But I look forward to the future more."

"Me too."

In the dormitory area, everyone was packing their luggage.

According to regulations, each person could only carry 50 kilograms of personal items. This forced everyone to make a difficult choice.

"Laptop, must bring. Hard drive, stored with 10T of materials (and movies), must bring."
"Clothes... bring a few sets of sturdy ones. Fashionable ones are useless."
"Photos of family... bring one as a souvenir."
"Chocolate, cigarettes... bring as much as possible. These are hard currencies."

Everyone was carefully calculating the weight and volume of each item.

Some people were writing suicide notes or diary entries, leaving their last words to the world.

"Mom and Dad, forgive me for being unfilial. I'm going to a far, far place..."
"My love, don't wait for me. Find a good man to marry..."

There were weeping sounds in the dormitory. Although they had made up their minds long ago, facing separation, they still couldn't give up.

At the playground, the military group was conducting the final inspection of weapons.

"Check the gun chamber! Check the magazine! Check the insurance!" Xi Yazhou shouted.

"Report! All weapons are normal!"

"Good! Everyone, load bullets! Prepare for battle!"

Xi Yazhou knew that crossing was not travel. The other side of the wormhole might be full of dangers. They must be ready to fight at any time.

As night fell, the assembly bell rang.

512 Transmigrators, wearing uniform camouflage, carrying backpacks and holding weapons, lined up on the playground.

Under the illumination of the searchlight, their faces looked resolute and tragic.

Wen Desi walked onto the rostrum. He didn't have a draft, just said one sentence:

"Let's go! To create our history!"

"Let's go!"

The team began to board the ship.

They walked across the gangway and onto the deck of the Fengcheng.

Looking back at the lights of the modern city for the last time, many people shed tears.

"Goodbye, 21st century."

"Goodbye, my hometown."

The whistle sounded, and the huge hull of the Fengcheng slowly left the pier.

It carried the hopes and dreams of 512 people and sailed into the boundless night.
