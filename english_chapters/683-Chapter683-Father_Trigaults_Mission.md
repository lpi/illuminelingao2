# Chapter 683 - Father Trigault's Mission

"Vice Lords!" His wife flung herself at the feet of the lead man, clutching his legs, crying and begging: "He hasn't done that trade since he lamed his leg—it's been years! Please show mercy and spare this cripple."

"It's fine. We won't kill him." The man with the blue collar tabs said. "As long as he answers honestly, he'll be back in a few days. If he's not honest—" He paused deliberately. "Then I can't say."

Chen Lianjian was released from the office two days later, barely able to straighten his back. His eyes were glazed. His face was stubbled.

"Your confession was very good. We hope you won't have any reservations, that you're not hiding anything..."

"I wouldn't dare, wouldn't dare." Chen Lianjian bowed and scraped, nearly in tears. "I—I told you everything, didn't dare hide anything."

"Go home and work hard! Don't mention what happened here. Understand?"

Chen Lianjian limped painfully, but forced himself to walk as fast as he could—the farther from this hellish place the better.

In those two days, he had told everything he knew. Where bandits usually operated, what named bandits were called, their jargon...

He felt like he had been put through an oil press, slowly squeezed drop by drop until he was just a dried-out husk.

Anyone connected to bandits received this treatment. These "conversations" weren't limited to bandits—they included ordinary people and local gentry.

The strategic village initiative continued advancing. Long-range survey teams from Lingao arrived, along with urban planning specialists from Lingao Construction Company. They would assist Danzhou authorities in properly laying out the strategic villages, ensuring each one would flourish in the future.

"Father Trigault is in the waiting room." Aimbrois whispered his report.

"Show him in." Jerónimo Geranzani sat in his chair, gazing at the large panes of glass newly installed in the window—Australian glass, made so large and thin, so much lighter, that it could be fitted into windows without the dense lead-strip lattices formerly required.

The large glass windows made the room much brighter. Geranzani, who had spent most of his life working in dim rooms, was initially quite uncomfortable.

Trade with Lingao had made Macao increasingly prosperous. Large quantities of goods were shipped from here to Europe and West Asia. Lingao's large-format glass was even being re-exported to Europe—even with the freight and losses over such distances, this glass was cheaper than Europe's crude, heavy small panes.

There were also large quantities of steel-tipped dip pens—smoother to write with than quill pens, requiring no careful sharpening of the point. If one wore out, you simply replaced the nib. And the Australians said worn nibs could be recycled at half price.

Not to mention *Da Tang Gongzhu*, the beautifully packaged *huangjiu*. The Society of Jesus had made untold fortunes on this. The beautiful porcelain bottles alone had become collecting targets for many locals. And every three months, the *Da Tang Gongzhu* bottle's porcelain quality and shape would change, setting off collecting frenzies among enthusiasts.

But what worried His Excellency the Superior most was that the Australians had started selling Latin editions of the *Bible* and *Catechism* to the Church.

The religious books they sold were not only cheap but beautifully printed, with many different editions. Large-print editions, pocket editions, and so-called "illustrated editions" with many pictures.

Geranzani had personally reviewed every edition and found that not only were they doctrinally identical to the Vatican-authorized version, but they were more carefully proofread. More perfect than the Vatican's own editions.

"This is truly incredible." Geranzani was shocked. A lost church's scripture matched the Holy See's authorized text word for word—too strange.

But strange or not, Lingao's printed religious books were far cheaper than German-printed ones. Soon, Jesuit ships were carrying books to Europe—if Lingao hadn't indicated their production capacity was currently limited, this business could have been even larger.

Lingao—truly a strange place. Geranzani's interest in this place and the Australians grew daily.

"My child, are you ready to go to Hainan Island?" he asked after the priest kissed his ring.

"Yes, Your Excellency." The man replied humbly.

Father Trigault's assignment to Lingao had been decided months ago. He and two other brothers would reinforce the two brothers who had been called to the Lord in the Li regions over recent months. But the Ming army's punitive expedition against Lingao had delayed this.

They had originally planned to travel on one of Huang Shunlong Trading Company's ships. But Huang Shunlong had received word: the Ming had moved against the Australians in Lingao. The army had crossed to Qiongzhou, and Ming warships were blockading the Qiongzhou Strait.

"No ship can get through now. Forcing through would likely mean losing both ship and cargo." Huang Shunlong said it would be best to wait until the situation calmed.

The Church had first learned of the Ming's military action against the Lingao Australians from Father Rodrigues's letters. The news had made the Society of Jesus very anxious—the Lingao mission had just gotten off to a good start. They didn't want it cut short. To this end, Geranzani immediately wrote to the mission in Beijing, asking them to see if they could take some action.

However, Father Rodrigues was quite optimistic about the Australians. He believed in his letters that the Ming army would certainly be defeated, because the Australians had organized "the strongest and best-trained army in all the Far East."

Summer arrived amid tense waiting, and news of the Ming army's rout reached Macao. The blockade of the Qiongzhou Strait had been lifted—the waters west of Guangdong had become Australian domain.

Geranzani returned to his desk: "I know you originally hoped to go to Hangzhou to carry on your uncle's missionary work there. But the future of China's evangelization isn't there. It's in Lingao."

Father Trigault heard this word again and lowered his head.

When he was sent from Flanders to the Far East two years ago, he had assumed the Society of Jesus would let him succeed his great distant relative—Nicolas Trigault, who had enjoyed the Pope's favor and had recently been called to the Lord's rest in Hangzhou, China. He himself had intense interest in Marco Polo's "heavenly city" and wanted to see this legendary city with his own eyes.

But after he reached Manila, Lingao spread through the Church like a spell. This obscure little place had become the Catholic Church's greatest excitement in the Far East, far exceeding the earlier achievements of converting *daimyō* in Japan or establishing a church in Beijing. Many priests hoped to sow the seeds of faith in the Lord's service on this land.

Everything about the Australians in Lingao had become an extremely hot topic among local clergy and gentlemen. Gentlemen coveted Australian wealth, while the Church saw the Australians' appearance on Hainan as divine guidance.

Manuscript copies of *Letters of Father Rodrigues* from Macao had become sought-after items among priests and gentlemen; everyone tried to borrow them. By comparison, Matteo Ricci and his successors' decades of achievements in China seemed to pale into insignificance.

Many priests hoped to go to Lingao, but the Society of Jesus had firmly secured the exclusive right to evangelize Lingao and Hainan Island—a privilege that had received papal approval.

Going to Lingao meant a high mortality rate. In three consecutive years, two priests had unfortunately contracted plague and been called to the Lord while evangelizing the "savage regions" en route to Lingao. Father Rodrigues alone had remained healthy; he had contracted plague several times but miraculously recovered each time.

After learning he would be sent to Lingao, Father Trigault had studied *Matteo Ricci's China Journal* and all the books and manuscripts about China he could find. Apart from finding a few reports from missionaries who had entered Hainan Island in 1560, 1563, and 1584, he learned that one of Matteo Ricci's greatest supporters in the Chinese court, the minister Wang Honghui, was a native of this island. His family still lived in a city called Ding'an. His son Paul maintained a small church there, occasionally coming to Macao to consult on church matters.

The Society of Jesus had originally been greatly interested in this small mission station in Ding'an, but the Australians' appearance had shifted all their attention regarding Hainan evangelization entirely to Lingao.

Superior Geranzani briefed him on Hainan Island and Lingao. Currently controlling Lingao was a group of Chinese who called themselves "Australians." It was they who had invited Jesuit fathers to come spread the Lord's Gospel. The "Australians" differed from ordinary Chinese—they were clever and quick-witted, treating people with the courtesy of Europe's most elegant gentlemen. This conversation filled Father Trigault with confidence in his mission.

"The church in Lingao has already achieved considerable scale." Geranzani wearily rubbed his forehead. "But they are entirely under Australian control."

"I understand what you mean."

"No, you don't understand—" The Superior's lips curved into a smile as he studied the priest.

"—Your task is to expand the Lord's flock, not create divisions within the flock."

"Yes, Your Excellency."

"Observe the Australians carefully. They are a different kind of Chinese altogether." Geranzani's face showed a strange smile. "Observe them well. Always remember to spread the Lord's Gospel to those without faith—but do not anger them."

"I understand, Your Excellency."

"Mr. Rando will accompany you to Lingao."
