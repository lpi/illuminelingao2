# Chapter 1433 - A Woman

After showering, he did not go to sleep in the dormitory. Instead, he returned to his room, put on a trench coat, and picked up the PHS from the table.

It had been several years since the transmigration. Although the call function of the PHS had not degraded, the battery life was almost gone. More and more PHS batteries had failed. Dr. Zhong had spent a lot of effort but failed to find a way to safely refurbish lithium or NiMH batteries under current conditions, so the PHS with dead batteries became landlines—two wires connected to a glass-encased external battery the size of a large dictionary.

But ultimately, the PHS required no laying of telephone lines, had dedicated numbers without needing switchboard transfer, offered strong confidentiality, and remained a favored communication tool for the Elders.

Jiang Shan dialed a number.

A woman's voice came from the phone. Her voice was crisp and bright but pitched very low, carrying a slightly affected coquettishness.

"Are you asleep?"

"No, I'm working. You know our work—there's always more than can be finished," the woman replied, then deliberately lowered her voice further. "I was waiting for your call."

"It's 1:00 AM. You're a night owl."

"I have a pair of green eyes." The woman laughed.

"How beautiful. Do you have time?"

"Anytime. I can get off work right now. Are you coming over or..."

"Go to the old place. I've already notified the guards."

"Okay."

"I need to make a few calls now. There are things I need to speak to others about. You go ahead; I might arrive a little later."

After hanging up, he made several more calls, then scribbled a few lines in pencil on the memo pad on his desk. Finally, he pulled the bell rope to summon the orderly.

"Prepare the carriage, I'm going out."

Jiang Shan's carriage was on 24-hour standby, available on call without needing to register for dispatch through the General Affairs Office duty room. This was a small privilege of powerful, critical departments.

"To No. 3 Lychee Grove," Jiang Shan, draped in his coat, instructed the driver as he boarded the carriage. "Drive a bit faster."

"Yes, Comrade Director."

Although someone had proposed at the Executive Committee meeting to grant military ranks to Foreign Intelligence Bureau personnel or "internal service ranks" like those of the Police and Political Security Bureau, Jiang Shan had resolutely resisted. He didn't want to be some "Regional Deputy Commander." Did the Director of the CIA have a military rank?

No. 3 Lychee Grove was the code name for a house in Bairen City. It was a "workplace" for the Foreign Intelligence Bureau. The Foreign Intelligence Bureau, the Political Security Bureau, and the National Police all had offices here. The offices of the Legal Tribunal's Investigation and Execution Bureau, known to almost no one, were also located in this lychee grove.

With the driver's hushed shout and the crack of the whip, the carriage turned a corner, leaving the main road for a cinder path through the woods.

Hundreds of lychee trees, ranging in age from decades to over a century, spread their dense canopies, plunging the midnight lychee grove into darkness. Only the safety lanterns burning along the carriage path barely illuminated the way.

Jiang Shan sat inside the carriage, opening the rain curtain of the two-wheeled carriage. He watched the driver and the guard sitting in the front seat. They were both soldiers of the Lingao Garrison Battalion, wearing cross-slung bandoliers with two modified .45 caliber revolvers, produced by the Machinery Plant to compensate for the insufficient power of the 9mm Model 1632 revolver.

The carriage stopped near a two-story red brick building in the lychee grove, and Jiang Shan got out.

"Park the carriage and go rest... I'm spending the night here... Come pick me up at seven tomorrow morning."

"Yes, Comrade Director."

Jiang Shan did not enter the offices here but walked through the porch directly out the back door to a room on the first floor of this small building. This was his dormitory here.

He unlocked the door, and light spilled out from the room.

There was a faint fragrance in the room—essential oils distilled from various plants and flowers by Zichengji. They were quite popular in the Guangzhou market, and female Elders and the Elders' maids commonly used them as perfume.

He closed the door. The room wasn't large, furnished only with a bed, a desk, and a two-seater sofa. The shutters were closed, and a large block of ice in the room made it feel cool and pleasant. A woman was sitting at the desk, examining herself seriously in a small round mirror. A makeup bag sat on the desk, with bottles and jars scattered about.

It had been almost five years since they transmigrated to this time-space. In 1633 Lingao, there were no longer any cosmetics or skincare products brought from the other time-space. These were "luxury goods" manufactured by Zichengji for export—all "all-natural products" with short shelf lives.

"You're here early. I thought it would be a while longer." The woman put down the mirror compact, turned around, and gave a charming smile.

She was about twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old, petite in stature. Because of the hot weather, female Elders rarely kept long hair, but she had a head of thick, black long hair. Her looks were not strikingly beautiful, but she could be described as having delicate features. With her exquisite makeup and girlish smile, she appeared much younger than her actual age.

"I said just a few phone calls; how much time could that take?" Jiang Shan took off his trench coat and hung it casually behind the door. He plopped down on the sofa and smiled somewhat wearily. "I didn't expect work at the Great Library to be so busy too."

"Look at you," the woman stood up, dragged her chair over to sit opposite Jiang Shan, resting her chin on the back of the chair to look down at him. "Our Great Library is the busiest department in the Council of Elders. Just compiling those propaganda pamphlets, revising books, translating ancient texts... the work is endless."

She wore a nightgown made of fine silk in a modified Hanfu style, accentuating her charming figure while showing off a pair of beautiful long legs. She sat sideways with her legs crossed; the hem of the nightgown rode up to the top of her thighs, revealing just a hint of the smooth curve of her buttocks.

Jiang Shan unreservedly appreciated the curves the woman displayed to him. The faint scent of carnations drifted to his nose, stirring something in his heart.

Seeming to sense his thoughts, the woman wiped behind her ear and brought her finger to her nose to sniff: " The scent has faded. You don't like the smell of carnations?"

"No, I like it very much," Jiang Shan said languidly, leaning back on the sofa. "You didn't use this perfume before."

"I saw that there are always carnations in your office and apartment. You must like this flower very much. Perhaps this flower is related to a certain woman."

"You are an observant woman."

"A girl's heart is always delicate," the woman laughed, then suddenly stopped smiling and stared into Jiang Shan's eyes. "Especially for the man she likes; even the slightest trace will make her a Sherlock Holmes. Would you like a drink?"

"Of course," Jiang Shan answered casually, adding, "So you're saying you like me."

"Otherwise, why would I be here?" She brought the drinks, took a bottle of kombucha for herself, and knelt on the chair with her legs curled under her, her smooth and delicate thighs completely exposed to Jiang Shan's gaze. "But I know you don't intend to marry me."

"What exactly are you saying?" Jiang Shan drank a glass of rum with lime juice with a strangely pleasant mood, then asked.

"Let's put it this way. I'm not bad-looking, and I'm a 'modern' woman. I've watched porn, read erotica, have some sexual experience, and know how to dress to suit a modern guy's 'interests.' Compared to a life secretary who offers nothing but her body in silent devotion and with whom you have zero communication—a dull, flavorless existence—I clearly fit your aesthetic tastes better."

"And then?"

"But a beautiful rose can never compare to a whole garden of flowers you can pluck at will," the woman said with a smile. "You don't pluck now simply because there isn't a flower in the General Affairs Office's garden that you find suitable yet—you're a perfectionist."

"So, as a perfectionist, I give up the rose?"

"If there were only a single rose in a rose garden, wouldn't it be too desolate?"

"Yes, indeed too desolate." Jiang Shan didn't want to discuss this issue with her at all. Of course he wouldn't discuss marriage with her. There was no need to discuss a decided matter in depth.

"Men are philandering animals," the woman brushed back her hair and took a sip of kombucha. "Maybe because spreading genes comes at a very low cost for men."

"I don't understand biology, let alone biosociology."

The woman gave a charming smile: "I just like this aloof coolness of yours."

"Some say it's being out of touch with the masses, unreasonable."

"Don't you know that women subconsciously hate 'nice guys'?"

"That's a sweeping generalization. Many in the Council of Elders are nice guys."

"That's why they are so keen on the creature known as the maidservant."

Jiang Shan did not answer—actually, he quite agreed with this view, but the topic was too dangerous. It was a super AOE taunt, first-class aggro-puller. Not only could he not agree, but it was best not even to touch upon the discussion.

He never believed in phrases like "heaven knows, earth knows, you know, I know." For some words, two people knowing was already too many. Moreover, the woman in front of him was not someone who could keep a secret.

"Look, staying silent when someone is talking, or answering irrelevantly, is not a sign of good breeding."

"Yes, it is impolite. You are quite right. But I don't like this topic. In my opinion, saying nothing is much better than joining a topic casually."

"Your slickness is really annoying. I thought a man from the upper class, from an elite family like yours, would disdain to act like this." She pouted cutely.

"I am not a member of any upper class. Nor am I from any elite family."

"You people always have a tendency to deny your own excellence, to belittle yourselves—I really don't know what you're afraid of. According to Director Xiao: you are an out-and-out elitist."
