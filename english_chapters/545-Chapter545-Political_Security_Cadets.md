# Chapter 545 - Political Security Cadets

But factories did not hire every day; Lu Cheng could only wait for an opportunity. She was on the older side and couldn't get into the various training classes at the Military-Political Academy. However, she didn't feel it was a pity, because a neighbor's daughter had managed to pass the Type-C Diploma exam and eagerly enrolled in the nursing training class—hearing she could treat the sick—only to flee home in terror after seeing a human specimen for the first time. Upon returning from school, she would tell many horrific stories, making Lu Cheng feel that "joining a unit" was a terrifying prospect.

Today, her father brought news: "Some Security Bureau is hiring. Go have a look tomorrow!"

"Security Bureau?" Although Lu Cheng was no longer unfamiliar with the "Newspeak" found everywhere in Lingao, she still couldn't understand the endless stream of strange meanings.

"I don't know either." Lu Bai pulled a towel embroidered with the red characters "Labor is Glorious" from his neck, rinsed it in the washbasin Lu Cheng brought, and wiped his face. "Probably a place like the village militia or the local defense bureau!"

"Would a place like that want women?" Lu Cheng was doubtful.

"The Chiefs have deep thoughts; how can Dad understand? Anyway, it's just serving the Chiefs," Lu Bai said.

Lu Shouye added, "It's true; the notice is posted at the Farm Headquarters. Men and women, no limit. Age under 23, must have a Type-C Diploma—isn't that perfect for Younger Sister? Serving the Chiefs has to be easier than working in a factory; look how hard Mother works on three shifts!"

Lu Cheng was tempted. If she could get a job, it would help the family immensely. The next day, she went to the Commune Farm Headquarters to see the notice.

Sure enough, there was a large notice on the bulletin board. A crowd gathered around watching and discussing, while a clerk from the Commune read it aloud. Lu Cheng had recognized a few characters back home, so after arriving in Lingao, she hadn't spent much effort passing the Type-C Diploma. Reading a notice was no problem.

The conditions on the notice were exactly as her brother said: men and women, unlimited; unmarried; 16 to 23 years old; Type-C Diploma. And the pay? She glanced at it and her eyelids felt hot: 200 yuan settlement allowance upfront, 30 yuan monthly salary during probation, and 55 yuan in circulation coupons after formal hiring—that was a lot! Her father, an accountant at the farm, only earned 60 yuan a month.

But reading further, the condition required working away from home. Lu Cheng immediately worried—a single woman going out to work alone was something she wouldn't have dared dream of when she was a sheltered girl. But months of wandering had emboldened her. Still, working alone?

Finally, the thought of lightening the family burden prevailed. After discussing it with her family that night, she went to the village office the next day, got her household registration certificate, and went to the Headquarters to apply. Several men in tight blue short jackets and belts checked her certificate and diploma, asked many questions, and made her read a "Newspeak" article and write a few characters on the spot. Then, inside a small room, she had to strip naked before two nurses for a physical examination.

Height and weight were measured. Then the nurse ordered her to trot in place, jump, and do leg kicks. Lu Cheng felt humiliated doing all this naked. As she hesitated, the older nurse's rattan cane lashed down.

"What are you shy about?! Jump!" Her buttocks, thighs, and back stung with several more lashes.

Wanting to cry but daring not to, Lu Cheng quickly completed all the movements. Finally, she was asked to look at a chart on the wall; she could barely make out the direction of the symbols on the smallest line.

"Vision: Excellent." The nurse wrote something on the white paper clipped to her board.

Finally, the nurse's gaze fell on her feet—Lu Cheng had "liberated feet." She had bound them in the past, but during the months of wandering, small feet made walking difficult, and she had no time or energy to wash and bind them daily, so she naturally let them out. After arriving at the refugee camp, binding feet was strictly forbidden. The Australian Chiefs were very strict about this: not only were girls forbidden to bind feet, but women with bound feet had to unbind them. Those who refused were forced. In the quarantine camp, Lu Cheng had seen several women who would "rather die than unbind"; the Chiefs didn't kill them, but sent their whole families to the labor reform detachments—immigrants knew what happened there.

"Pity about the liberated feet." Following this remark, a young man walked in from behind the curtain. Naked, Lu Cheng immediately squatted down in shame.

"Stand up!" the nurse shouted. " This is the Chief!"

Afraid of being beaten, Lu Cheng stood up slowly—the Australian Chief was her master, and it was heaven's law for a slave to do whatever the master wanted—but shame made her use her hands to cover her privates and breasts as best she could.

The young man looked her up and down with interest. The nurse barked again, "Put your hands down!"

Lu Cheng dared not disobey but covered her face in shame, her body trembling.

"Figure isn't bad!" the Chief commented, then sighed with regret. "The feet are a defect."

"Yes, but she unbound early. It seems the foot shape recovered well."

"Mm." The Chief seemed dissatisfied. "Can she walk and run properly?"

"According to Chief Head Nurse Zhang, it shouldn't affect much," the nurse said respectfully.

"Forget it, pass her," the Chief considered for a moment. "Too few girls applied."

So when she came out dressed, a blue stamp was already on her medical form. Five days later, she received the admission notice one evening.

"Congratulations, eating the public's rice now." The village resident police officer brought the notice. The officer wore a tight black buttoned jacket that Lu Cheng found comical, a flat cloth hat like a plate, puttees, and a baton at his waist.

The resident police officer was a role similar to the fast-squad runners of the old county yamen, but he lived in the village with his family. He was amiable and didn't extort people like yamen runners.

As the only person in the village receiving "wages" and eating "public rice," the resident police officer commanded the awe of all villagers—even the village head and militia captain, who held the most power, only received allowances from the Commune. Only the Commune stewards—or "cadres" in Newspeak—received wages.

Hearing Lu Cheng was accepted, the whole family was happy but also sad—after all, she was leaving home to make a living. Lu Bai and his wife shed tears.

"Alright, don't be sad. Your daughter is going to the General Security Bureau," the officer shook his head. "That's the Chiefs' praetorian department. I wanted to serve there but couldn't!" He turned to Lu Cheng. "Work hard; you'll prosper in the future!"

The officer instructed that he would pick Lu Cheng up early the next morning to take her to Headquarters. Lu Cheng knew two boys from the village had also applied and been selected.

"Don't bring anything; the public provides everything," the officer told her. " Whatever you bring will just be sent back. Just go in the clothes you're wearing."

Early next morning, the officer escorted the three from the village to the Commune seat. After a few comforting words, he left. The young Chief who had seen her naked was also at Headquarters; seeing him, Lu Cheng blushed.

A total of seven Security Bureau cadets were selected from Jialai Commune. Lu Cheng was the only female. The young Chief gave them a few words of encouragement. The seven were taken to the Commune station to wait for the oxcart sent specifically for them. Looking at the six strangers, blank-faced like herself, Lu Cheng realized this was her first time completely separated from familiar people. Only the clothes on her back came from her village. She stared blankly out the window at the road stretching into the distance.

Several oxcarts delivered the accepted cadets from Jialai Commune to the Fangcaodi Education Park. They were led into a courtyard guarded by sentries. Besides them, there were over thirty other teenagers and young adults.

"Line up! First Bairen Commune, Second Bopu Commune, Third Nanbao Commune, Fourth Jialai Commune." A clerk blew a sharp whistle, shouting to maintain order in the yard.

The cadets jostled into line. Another clerk at the gate held a clipboard and shouted names loudly:

"Bairen Commune, Ye Lüsu!"

A youth of eighteen or nineteen hurried forward.

"Idiot," he was scolded before he could stand steady. "Can't you shout 'Present'? Do it again!"

Ye Lüsu hurriedly shouted "Present!" and was let in.

Jialai Commune was fourth. Lu Cheng waited nearly an hour before hearing her name. She quickly shouted "Present."

Inside the main hall, several men looking like Chiefs sat behind a table. In the center was a white, fat Chief.

"Lu Cheng!" As she walked in and stood still, the clerk beside her began reading her registration data loudly. "Female, 20, unmarried. Registered: Jialai Commune. Status: Small proprietor. Education: Type-C Diploma."

The Chiefs flipped through the pages in front of them and looked at her. The young Chief said, "Ideally female—send to Secret Service Training Class?"

"No, assign to Security Cadre Training Class," the fat Chief in the center said.

So Lu Cheng went to the Security Cadre Training Class. After a cursory review, all cadets were assigned to three short-term training classes: "Reconnaissance Cadre Training Class," "Security Cadre Training Class," and "Secret Service Personnel Training Class." A few were eliminated—sent home directly without reason.

When she came out, a clerk gave her a small bamboo tag: " wear it around your neck!"

Then every cadet received a large backpack. Carrying the heavy packs, the cadets were led to the backyard by a clerk.

"Females over here!" A female clerk arrived and beckoned Lu Cheng and a few other female cadets—they were taken to a side courtyard.
