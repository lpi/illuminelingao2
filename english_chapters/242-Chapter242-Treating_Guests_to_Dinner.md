# Chapter 242: Treating Guests to Dinner

While they were talking, Wu Nanhai appeared wearing a straw hat on his head and a towel around his neck, followed by Wang Tian, a team leader of the farm workers. Since he used to be a foreman for long-term laborers, he counted as an expert farmer.

Wu Nanhai was saying something as he walked, and Wang Tian maintained a respectful posture all the way. Wu Nanhai was also a dark fatty (he was a white fatty before landing), so they looked a bit like a landlord and his hired hand.

Approaching them, Wu Nanhai finished his instructions, and Wang Tian ran off in a flash.

"Xiao Bai, what good stuff have you brought us again?" Wu Nanhai greeted Bai Guoshi upon seeing him.

The personnel of the Long-Range Exploration Team played the role of Santa Claus in both the Agricultural Committee and the Industrial and Energy Committee. Every time they appeared, the responsible heads felt they would bring some surprise.

"I told you, don't call me Xiao Bai," Bai Guoshi said painfully. "Please call me Guoshi."

"No problem, Xiao Bai."

"Thanks." Bai Guoshi said, "I got some medicinal seeds this time out."

"Medicinal seeds? The people from the Ministry of Health come here every day to nag: saying they want to set up a Chinese medicinal herb planting base, but no one here has learned how to plant herbs."

Bai Guoshi said, "There should be herb farmers in Guangdong and Fujian, right? If not, check the agricultural library for science and education films or something."

Fa Shilu didn't pick up on this topic but said: "Regarding the self-purchased seeds everyone handed over after landing, apart from a portion used, most are still in the warehouse. I took inventory of these unplanned seeds in the last few days. There are many problems. First, the preservation state is poor; some packaging is broken, and some have become damp and sprouted. Second is the issue of seed source; most people bought various seeds from agricultural supply stores near their homes. The problem is that seeds are not universal across the country. I did a preliminary check, and about a quarter are seeds only suitable for planting in Northeast and North China. Their yield here might be problematic."

"Can we store them? Like a seed bank or something, for use after we conquer the North in the future," Wu Nanhai said.

"Probably not. These seeds are all in simple packaging, and we don't have that kind of processing equipment for seed preservation."

"Just plant them then?" Wu Nanhai didn't have any brilliant solution.

"It seems to be the only way. Modern seeds have high-yield traits after all. Plant them for reproduction, not for harvest but to maintain their superior traits."

"Let's do that then." Wu Nanhai agreed—after all, Fa Shilu was more professional than him. Then he invited Bai Guoshi to lunch.

The transmigrators knew that the Demonstration Farm was the most corrupt place in all of Bairren City and even Lingao, one of the two designated spots for Executive Committee leaders' corruption. Although the Farm was inferior to the Navy Club in modern enjoyment, it had a wide variety of fresh vegetables and fruits, and the environment was beautiful. If the Fengcheng Inn was a five-star hotel, the Demonstration Farm was a farmhouse resort ("Agritainment").

Bai Guoshi gladly accepted the invitation. Liu Zheng and several other colleagues from the exploration team also came to the table—Zhao Xue didn't come because of her leg inconvenience, and Ye Mengyan wasn't in the exploration team's establishment: the Special Reconnaissance Unit was on standby at all times, so naturally, he couldn't come to enjoy it either.

Lunch was set in a riverside grove specially preserved by the Farm. The Farm had built a large pavilion here using bamboo and straw, with some flowers, trees, and fruit trees planted outside for landscaping. There was originally a natural river bend next to the pavilion; Wu Nanhai expanded it into an artificial pond, planting many crops like lotus roots and water chestnuts inside, and raised some ducks and geese. Sitting in the pavilion, one really felt relaxed and happy.

"You guys really know how to enjoy life." Liu Zheng scanned the dishes on the table—they were actually ordinary, mainly vegetables. Tomato scrambled eggs counted as half a meat dish; the real meat dishes were a plate of celery stir-fried with cuttlefish eggs and scallion oil stir-fried razor clams. Because they were all pure natural green foods, they naturally tasted delicious.

There was also wine on the table, fruit wine brewed by the Farm using nearby local fruits. It tasted sweet and sour with very low alcohol content, merely better than nothing for those who loved to drink—currently, the Executive Committee absolutely prohibited brewing wine from grain.

Since D-Day, these people hadn't had such leisure and comfortable time to gather together. Although the wine was lacking, there was atmosphere after all; exchanging toasts, the dinner table immediately became lively.

At this moment, a young girl with twin buns came over, carrying a large soup bowl. Snow-white round balls floated in the milky white soup, sprinkled with some chopped coriander. A mixed fragrance of pepper, coriander, and river fresh food floated in the air.

"Masters, please enjoy." The girl said softly, backing away with her hands down.

"Fish ball soup?" Cui Yunhong said.

"Sister Li made it," Wu Nanhai unbuttoned his coat. "Except for loving to use Sichuan pepper in every dish, her craftsmanship is quite good. Fortunately, we have very little Sichuan pepper here."

"Loves Sichuan pepper? A Northerner?"

"No, sounds like a Southerner accent. She won't say exactly where she's from. Seems to be a person with quite a story," Wu Nanhai said.

Liu Zheng said: "Is that the mother and daughter pair Zhang Xingjiao picked up from Goujia Village? They looked like skeletons back then; the girl actually grew up to be so pretty all of a sudden?"

"This is Chuqing, originally a maid in Gou Er's family. Sister Li's daughter is only eight years old—a loli, a loli."

Chuqing was kidnapped by chance when Xue Ziliang and the others went to scout Goujia Village. At that time, Ye Mengyan insisted on kidnapping her, but he forgot about this girl after returning. After staying in the quarantine camp for over a month, she was taken in by Wu Nanhai, who was gathering manpower everywhere.

Wu Nanhai smiled, "She's an orphan, so I took her in to take care of daily life or something. I also teach the two girls to read by the way."

"Nanhai, this mask of being honest and dutiful really is deceptive. Look at how many women you've collected in the farm?"

"That's right, first killing two birds with one stone (mother and daughter), then getting Chuqing. Tsk tsk, the number one beast of our Transmigration Group is none other than you."

"Damn, raising a loli is my dream!" Someone stamped his feet and beat his chest; the taste of letting someone else seize the initiative was always unpleasant.

"Damn it, playing Princess Maker, training milfs and lolis in such an environment—it's simply a dream-like life."

"The Beast Farm: Mother and Daughter's Wailing—" An otaku with rich AV experience immediately came up with a new title.

"Don't talk nonsense," Wu Nanhai waved his hands wildly. "Sister Li is now a full-time nurse working at the Ministry of Health. I just let her help with cooking here—"

"Nurse? Didn't expect you to have a uniform fetish too. How about it? When shall we exchange hard drives?"

...

After Wu Nanhai was teased in public for a while, he was finally let off, and the topic at the dinner table entered the main subject. As the saying goes, there is no such thing as a free lunch; treating guests to dinner usually implies asking for something, and Wu Nanhai naturally couldn't avoid convention. Fortunately, everyone at the table was Chinese and understood this basic principle.

What he proposed was: hoping the Exploration Team could organize some resource collection expeditions.

"You bring me a few fruits today, catch a few fish and shrimp tomorrow, and bring some kapok or something the day after. It looks like everything is useful, but for me, apart from enriching the biological specimen room, it's useless. Forget about minerals; they require massive construction to mine. But agricultural and forestry resources can surely be collected more, right?"

"Isn't there a liaison officer system? If you want something, issue a notice through Wu De, and nearby villages will naturally send it as tribute."

"The problem is that this county doesn't have some things. For example, coconuts. We wait eagerly for coconut seedlings to mature, but actually, this thing is everywhere on Hainan Island; it just hasn't flowed to us."

Liu Zheng said: "That's true, but our resource exploration team only has—" He suddenly realized he had let slip; the specific number of personnel in the Resource Department was classified content. "Not many people. How much can we carry back for you?"

"Yeah, take that patch of *Yi Zhi* encountered yesterday; if it matures, we could harvest at least a few hundred jin," Bai Guoshi chimed in.

"That's why I say we need resource expeditions." Wu Nanhai had considered this issue for a long time. "I plan to propose this suggestion at the Executive Committee meeting. For those agricultural and forestry resources you have already explored clearly but are not in our sphere of influence, we organize a few hundred laborers, vehicles, and boats each time, send armed escorts, and collect as many resources back as possible."

"It's not impossible," Liu Zheng knew this was a hope that the Resource Exploration Team would support this proposal during the meeting. From the department's interest, this approach wasn't bad; moving out with a large force was always much safer and more comfortable than a small team. However—

He also put forward his own request: "It would be great if our exploration team had a boat."

"Indeed, indeed," Wu Nanhai nodded repeatedly. "With a boat, you can conduct round-the-island exploration, greatly expanding the exploration range."

Everyone joked, ate, and drank for a while longer. After the banquet dispersed, Bai Guoshi walked alone toward the residential area.

His dormitory was in Group 5, known as the "Best Location" because it was opposite Group 6, the single women's quarters. Looking out from the dormitory window, one could see the main gate of Group 6. When the weather was hot, one could often see female transmigrators in revealing clothes wandering in the square in front of the group gate. Sometimes one could even see a few foreign girls in revealing clothes; especially once when Salina appeared in low-rise hot pants and a tight vest, it almost caused a riot among the otakus. When luck was particularly good, some claimed to have seen MMs changing clothes in dormitories, and rumor had it some had peeped at showers or the like.

However, such good things rarely happened. For safety, there were wooden fences separating each group, and each group had its own gate, closed at night. The main gate of the residential area closed at 10 PM every night, and individual group gates closed at 11 PM. Entering or exiting past the time required registration. Strict security measures were mainly for internal order considerations: the Executive Committee couldn't guarantee everyone was a modest gentleman—in fact, the past Public Security Team and the current Police Headquarters both had reports indicating petty theft existed among transmigrators. Stolen items were mainly modern consumable enjoyments brought along, like cola and cigarettes. Besides, there were several hundred single men here; it was hard to imagine what they might do seeing women in such a harsh and boring environment. Xiao Zishan, through Women's Director Du Wen, distributed several notices to young women, including advice not to dress revealingly outdoors and to draw curtains when changing clothes.
