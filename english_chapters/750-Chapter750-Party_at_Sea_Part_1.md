# Chapter 750 - Party at Sea (Part 1)

Zheng Shangjie came out of the Ministry of Colonization and Trade's PDCA session and first invited Pei Xiuli to the party—besides teaching half a day at the Maid Class, Pei was almost busy in Zheng Shangjie's office every day with Annual Meeting matters. Hearing she was invited to the party, she was very happy:

"I'll definitely go!" She gave Zheng Shangjie a charming smile, then suddenly frowned slightly, "Oh my, really headache-inducing, I don't have suitable clothes to wear, and I can't wear Guangzhou clothes..."

"I think you brought quite a lot of clothes." Zheng Shangjie thought that if discussing the quantity of clothes, shoes, hats, and cosmetics brought, probably no one in the entire Transmigrator Group had more than Pei Xiuli—take nylon stockings, the ultimate weapon for girls, currently only Pei Xiuli had sufficient reserves in Lingao.

"Shouldn't one wear a semi-formal cocktail dress for a party? I don't have one..." Pei Xiuli sighed in distress, "Only a *qipao* can make do—have to air it first..."

Zheng Shangjie hurriedly said: "It's fine, just wear something simple. We are informal, the dress-casual type."

After inviting Pei Xiuli, Zheng Shangjie hurriedly pedaled her personal bicycle—because they had their own boat, they were much looser in luggage quantity than ordinary Senators. Besides arms and materials, various daily luggage filled the bottom hold as ballast back then. Among them were several bicycles. Zheng Shangjie rode a Chinese-made mountain bike, with gears, solid tires, attached with a full set of repair tools and consumables. Zheng Shangjie used it for transport all along in Lingao. Although she had no specific position and was sent out for a time, she was good at socializing, had extensive friends, and broad connections among Senators; many people recognized this special bicycle.

She greeted Senators she knew along the way while rushing to Bopu. She still had many things to do to organize this party. Counting on Ai Beibei was impossible—it would be very good if she could take leave tomorrow; all medical staff of the Ministry of Health had almost no rest days.

Mendoza had plenty of time to help, but Mendoza faced a language barrier and couldn't handle many things, only able to do preparation work at home.

Zheng Shangjie first cycled back to the dock where the *Flying Cloud* was moored at Lingao Cape. This area, as the future Senator Seaside Leisure Zone, had already been fenced off with barbed wire and trenches, occupying a large piece of land and beach. A warning zone designated "Area 63"—externally called "Lingao Cape Park"—was established. The 2nd Company of the newly expanded Lingao Garrison Battalion was responsible for peripheral security—after the start of the Summer Awakening Campaign, the Army was insufficient, and Lingao's garrison troops were a bit empty. With the approval of the Executive Committee and Senate, the Garrison Company originally headquartered in East Gate Market was upgraded to Lingao Garrison Battalion, with Li Yayang promoted to Battalion Commander. The Garrison Battalion set up three companies. The 2nd Company was responsible for guarding Lingao Cape, Bopu Harbor, and other areas.

At this moment, the peripheral watchtowers and trenches of Lingao Cape Park were still under construction, and the landscape architecture, roads, and greening within Area 63 were also proceeding intensely under Li Xiaolv's direction—according to requirements, all projects in Area 63 must be completed before December 20, 1630.

Zheng Shangjie showed her pass to the Garrison Company soldiers guarding the Green Zone, speeding all the way along the newly built cinder road to the dock. A dedicated yacht marina had been built here. The *Flying Cloud* was moored there.

On the deck of the *Flying Cloud*, Miss Mendoza and Qian Xuanhuang were scrubbing the deck and the ship's outer hull. Qian Xuanhuang was a 16-year-old girl, recently bought by Zheng Shangjie from the Maid Class. To reduce the burden of housework, the three women—Ai Beibei, Zheng Shangjie, and Mendoza—held a meeting and decided to buy a maid. According to the maid subsidy share received by their three families, they could buy seven maids. If they bought them all back, the pomp would be huge; Zheng Shangjie thought about the days of ordering servants around and was a little fascinated.

However, considering the risk of triggering family conflicts and the fact that there wasn't actually that much space on the *Flying Cloud* to house servants, they finally decided to buy just one: Ai Beibei needed someone to look after Qian Duoduo, and Mendoza also felt a bit exhausted from scrubbing the deck to maintain the yacht and cooking for three families every day.

Finally, Zheng Shangjie bought Qian Xuanhuang. Of course, the men on the *Flying Cloud* had no say in what kind of maid to buy. The Qian brothers and Zhou Weisen all thought the bought one would be a D-Class maid with average looks. Unexpectedly, Qian Xuanhuang looked quite good—of course, by the standards of this spacetime. The receipt showed: Qian Xuanhuang belonged to Class B.

"Too ugly would affect our family image." Zheng Shangjie explained thus.

"What's her name?"

"Called Mu Jianping." When Zheng Shangjie said it, everyone laughed, leaving the girl carrying a rattan suitcase and feeling uneasy completely baffled.

"Too ridiculous." Qian Shuiting shook his head and said, "Since you bought her, let her change her surname to Qian. Count as a member of our family. As for the name, let's call her Xuanhuang."

"This isn't like a girl's name."

"Better than calling her Mu Jianping—this bunch of otakus really have bad taste."

So she formally changed her name to Qian Xuanhuang. From then on, Qian Xuanhuang became the public maid for the three households on the *Flying Cloud*, busy with housework and childcare every day. Life was very fulfilling. It saved her from the encounter of "doing various strange things" after other classmates were assigned out.

Qian Xuanhuang felt very curious about the three households living on this "White Ship"—their speech and behavior were different from the Chiefs she had contacted. Although she had to do a lot of work every day, Qian Xuanhuang felt the people on the ship treated her very well, not treating her as a slave, even eating together. She soon became deadset loyal to Zheng Shangjie.

"Xuanhuang! Go get the baskets!" Zheng Shangjie didn't get off the bike, shouting on the trestle while balancing on tiptoes.

Hearing the call, Qian Xuanhuang hurriedly ran down to the deck, coming out a while later carrying several rattan baskets with lids and a milk bucket with a rattan cover. She then took out a bicycle.

Mendoza helped together, hanging these things on both sides of the luggage rack. Taking an ox cart was too pressed for time; some dishes had to be prepared a day in advance.

Qian Xuanhuang also pushed a bicycle—under Qian Shuiting's instruction, she could now ride a bike very well.

"Let's go, we're going shopping."

Zheng Shangjie took Qian Xuanhuang to Bairen City first—she still had to invite other people to the party. First was Bei Wei. This person was hard to find and even harder to invite; firstly, he was busy with Special Recon Command training and duty; secondly, he wasn't interested in such social engagements—he felt the Special Recon Team should be in combat-ready state at all times. Early in the morning, he rode a bike around the Special Recon Team's several duty and training points in Lingao, inspecting combat readiness and training status everywhere. Zheng Shangjie had found out beforehand that he would attend the Military Affairs Directorate's PDCA session this afternoon and would definitely appear in the canteen at noon.

Zheng Shangjie squatted in the canteen and met Bei Wei and Xue Ziliang, inviting them to come to the *Flying Cloud* as guests tomorrow noon, under the pretext of exchanging pointers on firearms and wilderness survival. Xue Ziliang had been guiding "security warfare" in Danzhou and other prefectures and counties occupied during the Summer Awakening, and had just returned to Lingao for the Annual Meeting. Hearing there was a party, of course he wanted to go—moreover, he could go with Salina, an excellent opportunity to be gallant. As for Bei Wei, he wasn't very familiar with the Qian brothers, but hearing Qian Shuiting wanted him to guide marksmanship, he was moved. He knew these few not only procured arms for the Group but also brought many private collections. Although they turned in quite a lot, those were ordinary goods. As a firearms enthusiast, contacting guns he rarely saw was a huge temptation, so he half-refused half-accepted and agreed.

As for Salina, she asked Xue Ziliang to invite her on her behalf—these two had become increasingly close recently, so inviting her wasn't too abrupt.

Subsequently, she went to the Propaganda Department and invited Ding Ding and Pan Pan. Of course, Ding Ding actually couldn't go—because Ding Ding was going to Danzhou for an interview tomorrow. Zheng Shangjie deliberately set the party time at this moment so Pan Pan could act alone.

In addition, Ai Beibei also invited Lin Chuanqing, Shi Niaoren, and Chen Sigen. These three readily agreed—Shi Niaoren regretfully expressed he could only come for an hour—he still had classes to teach. Lin Chuanqing volunteered to do BBQ grilled fish on the beach.

"Tomorrow I'll let the sailors get a basket of the best seafood. The best and biggest crabs." Lin Chuanqing was now the person in charge of the Fishery General Impartiality in the Navy; various marine products were in his hands.

"Must issue an invoice; we pay the listed price. However much it is, don't give a discount." Zheng Shangjie urged.

"You aren't those big shots; why be so calculating over a few fish and crabs?"

"Even ordinary Senators must abide by the law." Zheng Shangjie deeply knew the subtlety of politics; don't look at a basket of seafood as nothing in Lingao, but in a confrontation, it could be a handle for "taking advantage of the public." Since the Otaku Party wanted to develop politically, such pretext must definitely not be left behind.

"Alright, as you say. Anyway, this stuff isn't worth money. At most count as you taking advantage of freshness."

"It's a deal then."

After repeated exhortations, Zheng Shangjie took Qian Xuanhuang to Wu Nanhai's farm—she subscribed to eggs and milk here. Since scale farming began, every Senator could get an egg ration every day, and the farm also started raising a dozen dairy cows—milk couldn't be universally supplied yet, only supplied to children under 14. Additionally, Senators could exchange their egg quota for milk.

Zheng Shangjie and Qian Shuiting had been away from Lingao for a long time; the couple's egg quota had accumulated. Today she collected a large part of it at once for the dishes used in tomorrow's gathering.
