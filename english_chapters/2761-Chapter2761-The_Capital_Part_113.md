# Chapter 2761: The Capital (Part 113)

"The Heavenly Book really says so," Wang Yehao said with a frown.

"Exactly."

"That's difficult." Wang Yehao frowned, "Yuanqiao (Wen Tiren) is a man who seeks revenge for the smallest grievance. Back when Shouzhi (Qian Qianyi) blocked him and Zhou Yanru from entering the Grand Secretariat, a feud was forged. Although Shouzhi was forced to leave office and return home, Yuanqiao did not stop there. Over the years, he has been secretly collecting Shouzhi's shortcomings, preparing to deal him a fatal blow. If, as you say, there is a great opportunity this year, how could he let it pass?"

"This student is also concerned about this, which is why I came to ask Master."

"Inappropriate, inappropriate." Wang Yehao shook his head repeatedly, "Yuanqiao has been in the Grand Secretariat for seven years and can be said to be in the Emperor's heart. Everything goes smoothly for him, and everything goes his way. Who in the court doesn't have to rely on his breath! Although he calls himself 'Lone Destiny' (*Du Ming*), in reality, his partisans are all over the court and opposition. Even the ministers of the Grand Secretariat dare not disobey his will. The court and opposition all say the Emperor has 'encountered plague' (pun on *Wen*). Even if we persuade him, he won't believe it, and I'm afraid it will invite fire to burn ourselves."

"Master is right. It's just that if the proposal to suppress the Kun succeeds..." Zhou Lezhi showed great anxiety on his face.

"Sir's concern is justified. However, Sir need not worry too much." Wang Yehao said, "Feiweng (Yang Sichang) was summoned to the Palace of Heavenly Purity a few days ago. He said that to resist foreign aggression, one must pacify the interior, strongly advocating exterminating the roving bandits first, then resisting the Eastern Barbarians and Kun scoundrels. The Emperor deeply agreed. It can be seen that regarding peace negotiations with the Kun, the Emperor has long made a Holy Judgment in his heart."

"I'm afraid it's unreliable." Although Zhou Lezhi had not been an official for a day, his understanding of the Emperor was not inferior to the old bureaucrat in front of him. "The Emperor has always been opinionated but not firm in his will. Once the matter of peace negotiations is leaked, the court discussion will inevitably be tumultuous. With the Emperor's temperament, when the time comes, he will turn his face and want to suppress again."

"Speak cautiously!" Wang Yehao lowered his voice, "Although you and I are talking in a dark room, we cannot lack respect for the Emperor."

Zhou Lezhi responded with a faint smile: "Yes."

"However, Sir's words make sense." Wang Yehao had been an official for many years, so how could he not know the Emperor's personality? He pondered for a moment and said, "We must absolutely not go to advise Yuanqiao. Otherwise, it is inviting fire to burn ourselves. This person has a very bad reputation inside and outside the court. We are not his partisans, so there is no need to do such a thing."

"If so, this plan for peace is afraid..." Zhou Lezhi looked worried.

"No harm." Wang Yehao pondered, "Since the Emperor intends to appoint Feiweng to the Ministry of War, it shows he still wants to 'pacify the interior' first. Peace certainly cannot be negotiated, but this suppression is probably just going through the motions."

Then he talked about Yang Sichang recommending Xiong Wencan to remain as Governor-General of Liangguang.

"...If he really wanted to suppress with full force, there is absolutely no reason to let Xiong Wencan wear his guilt. As for Fu Zonglong, the Emperor prepared only a Governor of Southern Gan for him. Comparing with the precedents of Eastern Barbarians and Roving Bandits, for a matter like suppressing the Kun that spans several provinces, the Commander-in-Chief must be a Supervising Minister (*Dushi*) or a Prime Minister (*Zongli*) to coordinate and command from the center. How could it be a Governor?"

"So, the Emperor is also going through the motions?"

"Correct! After all, the court discussion is tumultuous, and the Emperor cannot ignore it. Especially since the Kun scoundrels have already captured two provinces—although they are remote borderlands, they surprisingly established Administration Commissioners. There are quite a few officials of Guangdong origin in the court. Now that Guangdong has fallen for more than two years, the Imperial Court must have a gesture to appease them." Wang Yehao said, "In my opinion, suppressing the Kun is an arrow on the bowstring, but this arrow is made of wood."

"If it can really be so, it is also a great fortune!" Zhou Lezhi breathed a sigh of relief.

Fighting a losing battle, losing a few thousand troops, and wasting more than a hundred thousand taels of silver in vain was a pity, but at least it wouldn't hurt the bones and tendons.

"It's just that Xiong Xinkai (Wencan) is in danger!" Wang Yehao whispered, "If this suppression of the Kun fails, he will have to carry the blame for the fall of Liangguang."

"What about Fu Zonglong?"

"This is the person Feiweng prepares to use; he will inevitably be safe and sound. If Feiweng can pacify the roving bandits, and then pacify the Kun scoundrels in the next step, he will inevitably use him."

"So this student is relieved."

"That's right. Now the Restoration Society (*Fu She*) is powerful, and there are many scholars of Guangdong origin in it. If we insist on peace blindly, I'm afraid we will offend the Restoration Society to death. Don't forget we also have arrangements in Guangdong. If we really offend them, these arrangements won't be usable."

"Master is right." Zhou Lezhi couldn't help but express admiration.

"The only plan for now, I see, is to befriend the Restoration Society. Although Tianru (Zhang Pu) is idle at home now, his reputation is growing daily in the court and opposition. If according to the Heavenly Book, he can restore Zhou Yanru to premiership. The energy of this person and the Restoration Society cannot be underestimated. Moreover, they are anti-Kun. If we can befriend them, it will be a great help to the great cause of Anti-Kun in the future."

Zhou Lezhi naturally could only agree deeply. After all, he was not familiar with the operations in the court and relied entirely on Master Wang's grasp.

"In that case, regarding the matter of Zhang Hanru, Master can use some small tricks to show goodwill to Zhou Yanru." He reminded.

"This goes without saying. Since the Heavenly Book says Yuanqiao has no chance to turn over, naturally there is no need for scruples." Wang Yehao said, "It's just that you said Yizhai (Zhou Yanru) won't be Prime Minister for long..."

"Whether Yizhai is long or not depends on whether he can match our intentions." Zhou Lezhi said, "That's all the Heavenly Book can say."

Wang Yehao nodded and said: "You must be careful during this period."

"Many thanks, Master."

"You ask me?" Leng Ningyun laughed, "My opinion is naturally in favor."

While speaking, he was in the secret room of Delong, talking with Xu Ke who came in disguise.

Although theoretically, he didn't need to come to the front line personally, nor did he need to talk to Leng Ningyun face to face. But he still decided to take the risk to come to the Capital. One was to discuss the future layout of the Beijing Station with Leng Ningyun, and the other was to understand the situation in the Capital on the spot.

"I thought you would continue to endure humiliation and bear heavy burdens to use him." Xu Ke joked.

"I'm not that cheap. I was even invited by the God of Wealth. My small life was almost lost..." Leng Ningyun smiled, "But then again, if he were still Yang Gonggong's heart's delight, I really would have to consider it. But they have turned father and son into enemies, so this Yang Tianliang's utility value is not much."

"I think so too." Xu Ke said, "This Little Eunuch Yang is not only insatiably greedy but also so bold. Keeping him will inevitably be a scourge."

"What do you plan to do?"

"I have evidence in hand that he intends to kill Yang Gonggong. Take it to Yang Gonggong... Yang Gonggong himself will dispose of him first!" Xu Ke said.

Leng Ningyun shook his head and said: "Although Yang Tianliang is ruthless to his adoptive father, and the two can be considered to have severed kindness and righteousness. However, Yang Gonggong is hesitant to take action for fear of breaking the vase (collateral damage). Yang Tianliang is not an ordinary eunuch now. A sentence of 'drag out and beat to death' can settle the account. He not only has a position but also opened the channel of Wang Zhixin. How dare Yang Gonggong touch him. If he insists on touching him, Wang Zhixin will use this opportunity to blackmail him, and he will have to bleed heavily to smooth it over. He dares not do this."

"So basically only we can do it."

"Correct. After all, Yang Gonggong still has utility value for us." Leng Ningyun laughed, "Just yesterday, he sent the ten thousand taels of silver back."

"Good guy, this bunch of eunuchs really have thick skin!"

"Making money isn't shabby." Leng Ningyun laughed, "Speaking of which, our only channel in the palace is him, so Yang Gonggong still has to be perfunctory. For me, getting rid of Yang Tianliang is a good thing, otherwise having to deal with both father and son at the same time—with mutual suspicion between them—that is difficult."

He took a sip of tea and continued: "Yang Tianliang is shrewd and capable, and very greedy. He is a very troublesome client. In comparison, Yang Gonggong is old. Although he is an old fox, he loves to hear pleasing words. We can still squeeze a lot of resources out of him—I'm not just talking about silver."

"You mean relationships in the palace?"

"Correct. Chongzhen is actually like most Ming emperors, trusting domestic slaves more. Especially the batch of eunuchs he brought from the Prince of Xin's mansion. Although Yang Gonggong is not his direct line, he has been drilling quite a bit these years and gets along well with these big eunuchs. Otherwise, how could he bring me so many deposits?" Leng Ningyun said, "This is just one benefit. The benefit in intelligence goes without saying; eunuchs' news comes faster and more accurately. But I think we ignored another aspect of work on the broad high-level Ming officials."

"What?"

"Influence."

"Lobbying?"

"Exactly." Leng Ningyun nodded repeatedly, "Don't look at officials and eunuchs all saying 'Subject deserves to die' and 'His Majesty is wise', appearing to be 'Imperial Body Dictatorship', but actually, each has their methods to influence the court situation. The influence of eunuchs is actually not inferior to the Grand Secretariat. Take Wen Tiren who is going to be unlucky this year. If it weren't for Qian Qianyi writing an inscription for Wang An back then, and Cao Huachun saving him out of this bit of incense sentiment, Qian Qianyi would probably not have kept his head, and Wen Tiren, the Senior Grand Secretary, could probably have done it for a few more years."

"What court situation do you want to influence through eunuchs?" Xu Ke laughed.

"Not necessarily through eunuchs," Leng Ningyun spoke somewhat excitedly at this moment, "There are also cooperative objects among the ministers. We can now slowly cultivate agents."

"Agents, we are going to overthrow the Great Ming..."

"Overthrowing the Great Ming, that is a later story." Leng Ningyun laughed, "Is the lesson of Liangguang not enough? How much cost does direct rule take? If, I mean if, the Imperial Court is willing to negotiate peace with us? Sign a trade agreement or something with us..."

"Another Five Ports Open to Trade?"

"Don't you think this model is more cost-effective economically? It also fits the current financial situation of the Senate which is about to go bankrupt."

"Dream on! Can Chongzhen agree?"

"Take it slowly!" Xu Ke said, "After the Manchus entered the pass, various roving bandits mostly became pillars of the Imperial Court. In the end, at the end of the road, the Empress Dowager of the Yongli Emperor even thought of asking the Portuguese for help. As long as the time comes, any possibility exists. We build an agent team now; it will be very useful in the future."

Xu Ke thought for a moment: "What you say makes a lot of sense. But it's not that simple. After all, most of the upper class still have a stereotype about us, thinking we just have strong ships and sharp cannons, and are good at doing business."
