# Chapter 2817 Return To East Gate Market

Tan Shuangxi and Zhang Laicai set off from Daya Village before dawn—not that he had any urgent business. The villagers were simply too hospitable. If they didn't leave early, nine times out of ten, they'd be kept to eat again and asked to tell more "Northern Expedition Notes." Being wined and dined like stars was nice, but both felt it wasn't quite right. Though "relatives may yet grieve, but others already sing" is the norm of human existence, feasting and making merry in the village like this still felt somewhat heartless.

So they agreed to leave early in the morning. After departing Daya Village, they went to one last household. Business done, by the time they emerged from the village, the sun was already westward. Tan Shuangxi had no watch; based on the sun's height, he estimated it was around three or four o'clock.

"Let's part ways here," Tan Shuangxi said at a crossroads. "Go find your lover."

"Already seen her. Why go again?" Zhang Laicai laughed. "I'm heading home too. The house needs tidying up."

"Shouldn't you settle down and start a family? You can't just keep drifting, staying a bachelor and chasing yellow tickets!" Tan Shuangxi advised. Zhang Laicai was an immigrant with only one son in the family.

"Better worry about yourself first." Zhang Laicai laughed. "You're several years older than me! Besides, why marry? I already have a son. A casual companion is better—both sides happy, no strings attached."

Tan Shuangxi knew it was useless to talk. The two parted at a nearby station.

Originally, he'd been eager to complete the task and get home quickly. Now that the thorny mission was finished one by one, his mind relaxed, and the desire to go home wasn't as strong anymore.

If he wanted to go somewhere for fun—whether Maniao or Bairen—both had bustling streets, all sorts of novel and interesting goods, and delicacies from all over brought by immigrants and Senators. He had fought on the mainland for two years; just the "overseas deployment" allowance accumulated to over two or three hundred yuan. This money naturally couldn't be touched—it was for marriage and establishing a career. So when the bank came to promote during rest in Guangzhou, he bought Central Reserve Bank bonds.

Having bought bonds with the bulk, he still had several dozen yuan left for pocket money. This was enough for him to enjoy himself comfortably. Tan Shuangxi thought: coming back wasn't easy; might as well go to the most prosperous Bairen Market and have a good time.

Decision made, his steps lightened.

Bairen Market was the transportation hub of all Lingao. Both roads and urban rail radiated outward from it as the center. Tan Shuangxi boarded the urban rail and arrived at Bairen City before nightfall.

In the twilight, Bairen Market glittered. Gas lamps had been lit one by one. The even rarer "electric lights" were also gradually spreading among merchants. Previously, for safety and cost reasons, gas lamps were mostly used only for public lighting. Except for a few large department stores, nighttime lighting relied entirely on kerosene lamps. This somewhat inhibited nighttime commercial activity. Many shops closed after dark.

The spread of electric lights greatly changed this situation. Most shops extended their business hours. Although neon lights hadn't widely spread due to immature chemical materials and inert gas production, shop owners had long covered the bare bulbs with lanterns of various materials and colors. Under the night, the electric light made the shops along the entire commercial street shine brilliantly.

These days, with the northward forces undergoing large-scale rest and reorganization, droves of soldiers on leave flooded in. The market was flourishing more than ever. The streets were filled with Fubo Army naval and land officers and enlisted men, either drunk or laden with packages. Correspondingly, Military Police with chain badges had also increased.

The moment Tan Shuangxi got off, he was questioned by the Military Police. After checking his documents, they tirelessly asked what he was here for. Tan Shuangxi knew better than to joke with these guys who would leave before the other retirees, honestly saying he was here to "consume."

Out of the station, he followed the bustling crowd to Bairen Market's main road.

Bairen City and East Gate Market outside were now merged into one. The once heavily guarded Bairen City, which only Senators and a few naturalized citizens could enter, now had only a portion still in its original state, serving as the premises for certain agencies and residences for some Senators. The rest had been demolished. In municipal management, Bairen City no longer had special status. It became specific numbered "neighborhoods" of Bairen Market, rather than the past "Green Zone" that seemed like another country.

Naturally, these "neighborhoods" remained heavily guarded. But for ordinary people, the old Bairen Town had become legend.

Tan Shuangxi didn't know the ins and outs. To him, Bairen Market was "New York" in the minds of soldiers like them—the glittering world. Though very close to Maniao Fort, during his many years of service, he had come here less than ten times. He just remembered that each visit, the place looked vastly different from before.

The first time he came was back when the Fubo Army was still called the Lingao County Security Regiment. Tan Shuangxi had been a soldier for less than two months when he was sent to East Gate Market to "reinforce security." At the time, the whole county was in a panic, rumors saying the Imperial Court was about to come exterminate the Senate. People were terrified everywhere, and public security incidents occurred frequently on the streets.

Tan Shuangxi was no exception. Though he had answered the call to enlist, his motive had nothing to do with defending the Senate—purely for the military pay and rations.

Chen Kefa had it right. Before the Senate came, they couldn't find anywhere to risk their lives even if they wanted to. After the Senate came, at least there was a place where one could risk one's life for food and warmth. Tan Shuangxi's village was close to Maniao. He had witnessed firsthand the good days the salt farm enjoyed after attaching itself to the Australians. His trust in the Senate naturally ran deeper than recruits from other villages.

That first visit to Bairen City, East Gate Market was desolate. Over eighty percent of shops were shuttered. Some had even taken away their equipment and signs, leaving only empty storefronts. The shops that were open were mostly Australian properties. Soldiers were sent to patrol the streets to maintain order. Tan Shuangxi still remembered the long queue in front of Delong Rice Shop—people lined up pressed together, clutching stacks of grain circulation vouchers, eyes wide with fear, craning their necks to look at the shop door. Every time someone came out with a bulging grain bag or pushing a cart full of grain, the queue would collectively breathe a sigh of relief. Then came another round of fearful, tense waiting for the number to be called inside.

Such scenes could be seen in front of nearly every shop still open. People took the circulation vouchers they had recently hidden carefully under pillows or around their waistbands, panic-buying everything they could. Copper coins that had disappeared now reappeared in the marketplace.

Tan Shuangxi and his fellows received military pay not in circulation vouchers but in gleaming silver. This somewhat steadied their nerves—even if the Senate lost, the silver in hand wouldn't become waste paper. But there were still people quietly warning them: "Hurry up, drop your guns, shed your uniforms, and run! Don't sell your lives for the Baldies; the Imperial Army is about to arrive!"

Such words did frighten some. The second day at Bairen City, three men from his platoon deserted. Just two days later, these three were caught.

The consequence of deserting in the face of battle was made clear when combat discipline was explained during enlistment. As expected, these three were hanged at the crossroads that very day.

He still remembered the whole company lining up at the main crossroads of East Gate Market, watching these three unlucky souls struggle and die to the sound of military drums. The weather was overcast; the faces of civilians and soldiers alike were full of gloom. Even the Senators, whom they thought omnipotent, showed a rare somber look...

Two of the three executed deserters were refugees with no family or friends in Lingao. Long forgotten, Tan Shuangxi couldn't even remember their names. One was a salt burner from the Salt Farm Village. He recalled that before the Mainland Campaign, while preparing to deploy to the mainland, he accompanied the conscription personnel to Salt Farm Village. At the village office, he heard someone mention that name.

Now, this crossroads still stood. The eerie gallows had disappeared. The original Delong Grain Shop had been rebuilt and was now the location of Delong Bank's Lingao Branch. Those shops that once had their shutters tightly closed had almost all changed appearance in the renovations of recent years.

The second time he came to East Gate Market was not long after the first. The great victory at Chengmai. Tan Shuangxi, as a member of the participating forces, came full of pride to join the victory parade. The formation also passed along this main street, heading for the stadium—just like this time. Civilians gathered on the roadsides, cheering like mountain torrents and roaring seas. The troops wore torn, soot-stained uniforms; the common folk also looked impoverished. The shops on the street were still shabby and desolate. But hearts were jubilant. Tan Shuangxi, originally just "a soldier for pay," prepared to "run if things go south," now had a different thought: The world has changed! The Senate is going to rule!

After that, visits to East Gate Market seemed to increase. He came here two or three times a year now, especially during leave. He would bring his parents and brothers here to "enjoy Australian fare" and "see Australian sights," then eat several meals of various new dishes his parents had never had in their lives—"Kaifeng Chicken," "Korean Cuisine," "Hot Pot"... He would use the money he'd saved to buy fabric and daily necessities for everyone. Though his parents always scolded him for "wasting money," he knew they liked it.

Yes, who doesn't like good food? Who doesn't like dressing neatly and warmly? Who doesn't like those lovely and useful daily goods?

Being able to let his parents and family enjoy these things made him feel his service was worth it. To him, East Gate Market was not just a bustling street—it was the embodiment of a life rising ever higher.

He and his family had struggled out of the mire and lifted their heads.
