Chapter 54 Port Construction (3)

With water and electricity, the next step was to solve the housing problem.

Tents were only temporary. They couldn't live in tents forever. They needed permanent houses.

"We want to build brick houses." Mei Lin said, "Red brick houses."

"But where are the bricks?"

"Burn them ourselves."

Mei Lin found a place rich in clay nearby and built a simple brick kiln.

"This is a wheel kiln." Mei Lin introduced, "It has high thermal efficiency and large output. It can burn tens of thousands of bricks a day."

They used coal (brought from modern times) as fuel and started burning bricks.

A few days later, the first batch of red bricks came out of the kiln.

"Good bricks!" Mei Lin knocked on a brick, making a crisp metal sound, "The quality is better than expected."

With bricks, they began to build houses.

Rows of neat brick houses rose from the ground. Although the appearance was simple, the internal facilities were complete.

"This is the dormitory building."
"This is the office building."
"This is the cafeteria."
"This is the bathhouse."

Looking at the brand new community, the Transmigrators had a sense of belonging in their hearts.

This was their home in the Ming Dynasty.

In addition to houses, they also built a "Wall".

This was a simple defensive wall built with barbed wire and sandbags, surrounding the entire campsite.

There were watchtowers on the wall, manned by soldiers with guns day and night.

"This is to prevent beasts and bad people." Xi Yazhou said.

Although they hadn't encountered enemies yet, vigilance could not be relaxed.

Under the bright moonlight, the campsite was quiet.

Only the sound of the generator and the footsteps of the sentries echoed in the night sky.

This was a peaceful harbor, and also a fortress ready to go.
