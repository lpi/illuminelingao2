# Chapter 1008 Fuzes

That day, Lin Shenhe and Jiang Ye conducted several mechanical tests on the press—using inert powder with physical properties similar to black powder, proving all machinery was operating completely normally. Jiang Ye then added sufficient lubrication to all moving parts to ensure no problems during operation.

This wasn't the first time the Machinery Department had manufactured specialized presses for pyrotechnics—they had used them when manufacturing brown powder propellant cakes—but previously they hadn't performed such high-pressure, high-density pressing.

Early the next morning, Lin Shenhe and the naturalized citizen workers who volunteered to help put on blast-resistant suits and specialized helmets provided by Pan Da, then shuffled step by step to the machine.

Room temperature was stable at 13 degrees; the hygrometer showed 90% humidity.

"Everything normal." A naturalized citizen worker specifically monitoring the thermometer and hygrometer made a hand signal.

Lin Shenhe took a deep breath and opened the sealed barrel containing gunpowder.

Inside the barrel was newly made powdered black powder—Lingao's black powder was generally granulated for storage: powdered black powder in storage tended to cause component settling and separation.

He carefully scooped gunpowder from the barrel with a copper measuring spoon, precisely weighing out 1000 grams on the table scale. He poured it into a large porcelain container, then added alcohol solution of specified concentration. A naturalized citizen worker began slowly stirring with a wooden stick until completely uniform.

"75-gram charge." Lin Shenhe instructed. So far, everything was still normal—this was also the safest stage. What followed would be the critical steps.

Following his instructions, the naturalized citizen worker took the corresponding mold from the box and fixed it on the base. There were several molds, corresponding to different charge column shapes and masses, all made of copper.

After the mixed black powder was precisely weighed and loaded into the mold, Lin Shenhe, not trusting the workers, personally operated the press. The press's pressure device drove the hydraulic cylinder through a manual wheel, slowly applying pressure to the screw.

He turned the wheel slowly and evenly, ensuring pressure wasn't transmitted too fast—too fast or too hard could easily cause explosion. Inside the blast suit it was stuffy and hot; his mood was extremely tense, and before long he was dripping with sweat. This gave him the illusion that room temperature had risen.

"Check temperature!"

"Temperature 14.5 degrees, humidity 90%! Normal!"

He had specially calculated the 75-gram charge column dimensions using formulas to ensure no over-pressing. However, this was only a theoretical result; whether reality would match he wasn't fully confident about. Of course, as dimensions approached closer and closer, the sweat beads on Lin Shenhe's forehead grew more and more. He turned several more circles until the powder surface dropped to the marked line—the first charge column was formed.

Lin Shenhe carefully removed the charge column from the mold and placed it on a fixing tray—next was waiting for it to dry naturally.

The explosives building had a dedicated drying room, but this time was an experimental product of unknown properties that couldn't be mixed with production items for drying. So the laboratory had a separate drying room where air humidity and temperature were likewise controlled; charge columns dried naturally at room temperature below 40 degrees.

"Then on to the next!" Lin Shenhe's confidence surged. Since no accidents occurred during pressing, it meant the entire process was problem-free.

He pressed charge columns of various sizes and masses, including ones prepared for filling grenades—current grenades in terms of power were merely large firecrackers, with negligible lethality, what Americans called "concussion grenades."

Another use for pressed charge columns was as rocket propellant. Charge columns of consistent shape and density were an important guarantee for rocket ballistic consistency, highly significant. By his estimate, after switching to these new pressed charge columns, both range and accuracy of Hale rockets could reach a new level.

Of course, high-density black powder charge columns' greatest use was filling artillery shells, bringing originally decorative-purpose explosive shells to a new level of power. Lin Shenhe believed that although the 12-pounder and 24-pounder smoothbore cannons widely used by the current army had advantages of simple manufacture, simple use, and suitability for low-tech-level armies, in the long run the disadvantages of smoothbores' relatively low power and slow firing rate couldn't be overcome—not as some boasted, "useful for twenty years."

Mass manufacturing and equipping rifled artillery was an inevitable choice for the Senate's military system. Currently, only the Navy and coastal artillery used some rifled cannons—both muzzle-loading and breech-loading—but none had become standard equipment, only sporadically installed in an experimental nature. The main reason, besides cost, was that rifled cannon bore pressure was far higher than smoothbores. Spherical shell fuzes couldn't be used on rifled cannons, so to date all rifled cannons could only use solid shot.

The conical solid shot fired by rifled cannons had killing effects far inferior to smoothbores' spherical shot—the latter could still kill during bouncing and rolling after landing, while conical solid shot just embedded in the ground. The advantage was extremely strong penetration, very powerful against city fortifications and warships.

To let rifled cannons demonstrate sufficient power, fuzes first had to be solved.

While waiting for charge columns to dry, Lin Shenhe had people manufacture fuzes.

Lin Shenhe had long wanted to solve the fuze problem. The main problem he faced was: the materials branch of the Senate's industrial system was in very poor condition. And to manufacture safe, reliable fuzes inevitably required springs.

Springs were inconspicuous items in the old dimension, but in Lingao, manufacturing springs was genuinely high technology. Springs usable in rifled cannon fuzes were crystallizations of industrial technology: encompassing steel smelting, alloy materials, and heat treatment specialized techniques. Lingao's industry could also produce springs, but from materials to manufacturing they were extremely low-end products, barely adequate for simple applications like carriages and sofas—just shorter lifespan and more frequent replacement. Used in artillery shells, at best they'd fail to detonate on impact, affecting combat; at worst they'd suddenly explode, causing major accidents.

Because of this problem, whether Lin Shenhe, Wang Ruixiang, or various Senator military enthusiasts, all wanted to solve this issue but none succeeded—no matter what conception, ultimately they couldn't overcome the threshold of "qualified springs."

Fuzes were consumables; costs had to be low enough for mass production and use. Simultaneously, the Senate's machining industry workers' skill level was generally not high; technical difficulty in processing and production had to be reduced as much as possible to ensure uniform production quality.

On this issue, Lin Shenhe specifically reviewed extensive materials, finally deciding to design based on the Japanese Type 91 rifle grenade fuze. This was a structurally simple impact-detonation type, relying on the inertia of the warhead moving forward upon target impact to overcome anti-creep spring resistance to achieve ignition. The safety measure was a safety pin pulled before firing. The entire fuze design required only one anti-creep spring, with low spring performance requirements—very suitable for Lingao's current industrial capacity.

In this fuze, the detonator tube was at the fuze's base; the fuze's front end was a long rod-shaped inertia body with striker. The inertia body was separated from the detonator tube by the anti-creep spring and fixed with a laterally inserted safety pin. To ensure firing rate, the inertia body had a crown-shaped pressure plate at the top in a long rod structure. Before firing, pulling the safety pin disarmed the fuze into combat state. During cannon firing, the inertia body remained at the front under anti-creep spring action, ensuring no premature detonation; after target impact, under warhead inertia, the anti-creep spring was compressed, the striker struck the firing element, detonating the fuze.

The machinery factory quickly manufactured a hundred fuzes according to his design drawings—half made by Senators, half by naturalized citizen technical workers. Lin Shenhe wanted to know what the naturalized citizen technical workers' pass rate would be during formal production.

Visual inspection and simple experimental acceptance results showed naturalized citizen workers had about 40% pass rate. This ratio was roughly acceptable to Lin Shenhe—this was manual assembly; during mass production with extensive use of specialized process equipment, plus workers becoming more skilled, the pass rate would greatly increase.

Lin Shenhe believed that according to his design, the fuze's performance requirements for the anti-creep spring itself weren't high; the highest-grade phosphor bronze springs currently produced in Lingao should be capable. He conducted dozens of trials in the laboratory with phosphor bronze spring fuzes—every time the phosphor bronze spring correctly responded.

However, the laboratory had no specialized equipment that could simulate the high-temperature, high-pressure environment when shells were fired, nor could it simulate shells' high-overload conditions during flight. Simple weighted drop tests couldn't reflect fuzes' true performance. Lingao's military engineers could only use the simplest method: live-fire testing to verify their designs.

Lin Shenhe borrowed a rifled cannon from Ying Yu—this was one of the 70mm breech-loading rifled cannons earliest manufactured by the military-industrial department for the four 8154 vessels. After being removed from ships, it had been in storage.

Since 70mm rifled cannons had never manufactured explosive shells, Lin Shenhe first had the machinery factory make twenty explosive shells, installed fuzes, with sand as weighted substitute for explosives.

He carefully marked and separated shells fitted with Senator-made fuzes and naturalized citizen-made fuzes, then borrowed horses to tow the cannon to the range, beginning experimental firing.

Lin Shenhe personally served as gunner. Propellant used was brown powder with better firing safety. For the first firing, Lin Shenhe didn't use full charge, only reduced charge.

The firing range sites were hard soil surface, medium soil, and wetland environments. The first round of firing achieved very good results. After excluding failures caused by fuze manufacturing quality itself, on hard and medium soil the fuzes achieved 90% firing rate; in wetland environments also achieved over 70% firing rate. From practical combat effectiveness, completely qualified—current smoothbore cannon explosive shells averaged only 70% detonation rate.
