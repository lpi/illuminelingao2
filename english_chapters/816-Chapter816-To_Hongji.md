# Chapter 816 - To Hongji

Wen Desi said, "I support this plan unconditionally." He sighed. "Going back to where we once fought!"

"Yes, thinking back to the old days when Chief Wen broke through bandits single-handedly, sweeping thousands with a PPK machine gun and cutting down bandit leaders with a knife—we all admire that style immensely..." Si Kaide said.

"That's all in the past, let's not mention it," Wen Desi waved his hand casually.

"Everyone, don't get sidetracked," Ma Qianzhu said. "Let's continue discussing the Hongji development."

Dongmen Chuiyu spoke as the representative of the Military Affairs High Command: "Our current troop strength is insufficient—the only available mobile forces are the Lingao Garrison Battalion and one battalion at Ma'ao."

Insufficient troop strength was a curse that constantly plagued the Lingao regime. Overall, Lingao was currently an island regime, well-suited to a "large navy, small army" force structure, using sea control to secure the homeland from attack while the Army served as an overseas expeditionary force.

Theoretically, under this system, the Lingao regime's mobile forces should have been ample—the Council of Elders possessed the timeline's strongest maritime projection capability, able to move troops rapidly along the coastline, making one battalion effectively worth several.

But the transmigration regime in Lingao was also an alien regime. Although the Elders did their utmost to buy hearts and minds, and the 17th century lacked strong nationalist tendencies, the chaotic social order of a medieval country meant social resources couldn't be fully utilized. This forced the army to take on the task of social transformation—a role not originally its primary responsibility.

Although the Chengmai Campaign had ended over half a year ago, and the Council of Elders had controlled the northern counties of Hainan for at least three months, the Army's main force was still tied down in a comprehensive "clean-up" of the localities. The General Staff's public security war in northern Hainan pinned down most of the Army's strength—four regular infantry battalions were dispersed across the entire northern region, carrying out a motley array of garrison, escort, and bandit-suppression missions. The Army, which should have served as a projection force, had no strength left to spare for new combat operations.

"...If we open a Hongji front, we can only use the Army General Reserve at Ma'ao," Dongmen Chuiyu expressed concern. "To defend Hongji, we'd inevitably have to form a Hongji Garrison Battalion—that would take at least three companies. If the Northern Court insists on 'defending national sovereignty and territorial integrity,' given their mobilization level, surrounding Hongji with ten or twenty thousand troops is very possible. Whether three companies can hold Hongji is highly questionable. The General Staff's wargames suggest it would take at least a full-strength infantry battalion to defeat a North Vietnamese punitive expedition."

The Elder officers of the Military Affairs High Command had run numerous simulations on various plans and scenarios. The final result was that Lingao's military forces were still quantitatively insufficient, capable only of fighting short, quick-in-quick-out wars; sustained operations still carried the risk of stretching them too thin.

The solution was naturally to expand the army, whether by enlarging the regular force or forming new second-line garrison units... Yet the Elder officers themselves felt unable to ask for it: demographic statistics for all of Hainan weren't out yet, but estimates put the total population at most 500,000. The current Army and Navy strength already exceeded 15,000. With a ratio of 1 soldier for every 30 people, the Lingao regime was arguably the most militaristic in history, surpassing even Prussia, the "army with a country." If not for continuous blood transfusions from mainland trade and the army spending considerable peacetime helping with construction, such a force would have been impossible to maintain.

After the Chengmai Campaign, the Executive Committee had briefly considered reducing some Army and Navy personnel to fill grassroots cadre roles, but subsequent developments caused this disarmament plan to be completely aborted.

"...An expedition to Vietnam is effectively another division of forces. We'd have to maintain a long-term presence in enemy territory, possibly fighting a long war, and threats like Zheng Zhilong and other sea lords still haven't been eliminated..." Dongmen Chuiyu continued his report.

"We're in a vicious cycle now," Zhan Wuya said. "To run large-scale industrial production, we need to spam units to grab territory for raw materials and fuel. Spamming units requires massive amounts of munitions. Munitions require heavy industry. Heavy industry needs raw materials and fuel. Raw materials and fuel require grabbing territory. And grabbing territory requires spamming units..."

Wen Desi interrupted Zhan Wuya's complaining: "This is indeed difficult, but just listing problems yields no results—let me share my view: First establish an armed trading post. Pay some currency or goods to hire local natives to mine coal, then recruit a mine guard force from among the miners..."

"Let Vietnamese natives mine coal? In the old timeline, I heard their unions were powerful—striking at the drop of a hat," Si Kaide expressed doubt about Vietnamese labor efficiency. He came from a foreign trade background; back then, many export factories had moved to Vietnam to save labor costs, only to soon complain bitterly that Vietnamese workers were too lazy.

"Monkeys are actually quite hardworking—at least better than the natives further south. They grow three crops of rice a year—is that something lazy people do?" Wen Desi said. "Besides, unions are a heresy that doesn't exist in this timeline. And another point: Vietnam has a large population, enough to sustain mining consumption. Aren't they fighting a civil war now? In this kind of medieval society, fighting a major battle with over a hundred thousand troops in such a tiny territory means utter misery for the people. We can acquire a large amount of population for a very low price—just giving them a full meal will do."

Wu De said, "In the long run, an armed trading post can also serve as a base for subtly cultivating and transforming the local natives, beneficial for our future imposition of a new order."

In the Council of Elders' master plan, countries in the "Sinosphere" like Vietnam, Korea, and Japan were destined to enter the "East Asian New Order" system, with status different from the natives of the Southeast Asian archipelago.

Everyone had no objection to Wen Desi's plan to use local labor. Even if Vietnam couldn't provide enough local labor, in the long run they could ship slaves to fill the mine pits.

Dongmen Chuiyu said, "I'm just worried an armed trading post can't hold off a Northern Court attack..."

"We'll try our best to keep it to peaceful trade," Wen Desi explained his proposal. "The trading post serves only as a shelter in emergencies. So the scale doesn't need to be large—just sturdy enough to hold out until the Navy arrives."

The transmigrators' intent was just to mine coal, not occupy territory. Hongji wasn't some land of milk and honey anyway, just a desolate, hilly peninsula. Lingao's glorious war record should have reached the Northern Court by now. The Northern Court was already at war with the Southern Court and had its hands full; it wouldn't make sense to start a major fight with a powerful military force over a small piece of wasteland—especially when the other side's goal was just mining coal. Wen Desi's plan was based on this prediction.

Yu E'shui said, "My personal view is that Chief Wen's plan is feasible. Every time the Northern Court moves south, they're blocked by the Nguyen clan's fortress complex near the 17th parallel and the munitions provided by the Portuguese. They're desperate for external aid—historically, the Dutch will soon serve as their advisors. If we provide some munitions in exchange, letting us stay in Hongji to mine coal won't be an intolerable price for the Northern Court. And it can push out Dutch influence there."

"Selling arms?" Some found it hard to accept. In the past, Li Luoyou's attempts to buy arms for the Ming had been rejected; now suddenly they were going to sell arms to the Le Dynasty in the north.

"Do we have enough steel?"

"With No. 1 Blast Furnace, steel capacity has expanded more than ten times. Consuming some to exchange for sufficient power coal is beneficial for us." Zhan Wuya felt a flush of wealth after the successful blast furnace ignition a few days ago. "No. 1 Blast Furnace isn't even at full capacity yet, and daily pig iron output exceeds 60 tons. No. 2 Blast Furnace can go into production in another month."

"There's also medicine, processed instant food—we can do toll processing for food... All these can be sold as trade goods to the Northern Court. Similar to what we sell the Manchus," Si Kaide said. "I don't think the Northern Court will refuse this trade request. Medicine and instant food are very useful militarily."

Finally, the resolution to establish a trading post at Hongji to mine coal was passed. As a first step, the Vietnam Trade Company was separated from the Leizhou Station. The Vietnam Trade Company became a state-owned enterprise directly under the Colonial Trade Ministry, achieving the same status as Leizhou Sugar Industry. Its headquarters remained in Leizhou.

In a luxurious residence on Hai'an Street in Haikang County, Leizhou, the Elders of the Leizhou Station sat around a table, the atmosphere a bit subtle. The table was piled with account books and the like; besides an abacus, there was a pocket electronic calculator.

A big black fellow spoke up: "All right, the accounts should be clear now, right?"

The female Elder who was filling in the final figures on a form straightened up—she was none other than Jin Zhijiao of the Cheka. She said, "No problems. There are a few transaction violations, but nothing serious." Saying this, she stamped the handover audit form. "Done!"

"Old Wen, I'm leaving you. Don't miss me..." The big black fellow was Chang Shide. A few days ago, he had received a telegram from the Organization Department ordering him to "prepare for handover immediately, transferred to Lingao for another assignment." Following the telegram came this Cheka woman.

The Hongji operation began with personnel transfers: Chang Shide was transferred out of Leizhou; Yan Maoda was officially transferred to Leizhou as General Manager of the Vietnam Trade Company; Bei Kai was appointed Trade Representative to North Vietnam. The latter had undergone long-term Vietnamese language training in Lingao—learning strange Vietnamese words from a TV set every day had been tough. Although Bei Kai repeatedly emphasized his family had no connection to Vietnam, he was picked for the Representative position because he looked "very Vietnamese."
