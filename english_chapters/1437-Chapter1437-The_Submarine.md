# Chapter 1437 - The Submarine

"A boat that can sail underwater?!" Lando narrowed his eyes. This was his second meeting with Mr. De Fernando at the tavern. The news that the shipyard was building a submarine was truly somewhat surprising. Although Mr. Vince Lando had never been a studious pupil, he still recalled seeing the *Turtle* from the War of Independence in popular history books during his middle school days. Though he wasn't interested in it, he at least remembered that the thing could submerge and navigate, and had once attempted to destroy a British Navy warship.

"That's ridiculous. How can a boat float up after sinking underwater? You must have drunk too much tuba."

"I swear to God, I haven't." Captain Fernando, terrified that the gold coins already in his pocket would fly away again, described in detail the secrets of this mysterious submarine that had been completed and had already undergone a sea trial.

According to Captain Fernando's description, this small submarine "resembled a shark" and had eight crew members. Its design was very simple, with no facilities like ballast tanks. Naturally, there was no need to flood or pump water. The submarine was lowered directly into the sea by a crane. By carefully calculating buoyancy and gravity, and using four external iron ballasts and four leather bags "filled with oil," the submarine was made to suspend underwater at a depth of half a Spanish fathom—about 0.8 meters—when fully loaded. At this depth, the conning tower at the bow was roughly slightly above the water surface, allowing observation of the sea conditions. The submarine was propelled by crew members hand-cranking a propeller and steered by a rudder. When it needed to surface, discarding the ballast tanks directly would allow the submarine to float up. Of course, the submarine would no longer have the ability to submerge at this point and would have to return to port to re-equip with ballast.

"A boat capable of lurking underwater is certainly nice, but how will you operate it in combat? Obviously, you can't fire cannons underwater."

"Yes," Captain Fernando agreed. "This involves another mysterious new weapon invented by Mr. Takayama."

This thing did not exceed Lando's expectations—it was indeed a spar torpedo. He had seen spar torpedo boats built by the Council of Elders in Bopu and other places—since there were really no targets worthy of their deployment, these spar torpedo boats were currently assigned to harbor defense duties.

In his view, operating such a useless weapon was extremely dangerous—bordering on suicide—and it only made some sense for a navy like the Council of Elders, which possessed steam power and armor manufacturing capabilities, to equip them.

"This weapon is designed very cleverly. It can easily pierce the hull of an enemy ship. After hooking the torpedo body, the submarine can quietly leave—it will explode thirty minutes later, very punctually." Captain Fernando spoke with great enthusiasm, seemingly completely disregarding the immense danger involved.

Simply madness! Mr. Lando thought. Using a human-powered submarine without even a periscope to conduct spar torpedo attacks—this was simply a 17th-century Kamikaze squad! Captain Fernando probably didn't understand the enormous danger he would face at all.

"Do you have a chance to arrange for me to see this boat?"

"I'm afraid it's very difficult. There are sentries around the dock at all times."

The black-clad man tapped the gold coin in his hand lightly. Captain Fernando swallowed, "I'll think of a way."

In the subsequent few meetings, Captain De Fernando provided almost all the details of this submarine, so much so that Mr. Lando, who had no drafting experience, could draw a line diagram based on his description that even he himself couldn't understand. However, the matter of entering the shipyard for an on-site inspection of the submarine never materialized. Mr. Lando decided not to wait any longer. Since he already knew the general structure of the submarine, and he had no knowledge of this ancient weapon anyway, he wouldn't be able to analyze anything even if he saw it.

At this moment, Mr. Geronimo's headache was getting worse: seeing the deadline stipulated in the new patrol boat contract getting closer, and the recently established munitions factory sucking away skilled Chinese craftsmen like a water pump, Geronimo found he couldn't even gather enough blacksmiths to make boat nails. The most fatal thing was that even iron materials were in short supply. If that Paulo Takayama hadn't sent people to generously deliver some bent scrap iron to him, he really didn't know how to continue this work.

Although these iron materials looked as if they had been soaked and corroded in seawater, after removing the rust spots and heating them, the shipyard blacksmiths were full of praise for them—they were all excellent malleable wrought iron.

Geronimo Paño had plenty of reasons to curse this damned job. Just a few days ago, Count Fananovoua, the hottest social star in all of Manila, graced the shipyard with his presence aboard the *Esmeralda*, beautiful as a white swan. What a noble and generous man that was! Geronimo could have repaired his yacht and easily taken handfuls of gold coins from his pocket. But this nobleman walked around the shipyard, shook his head at the packed slipways and docks, returned to his yacht, cast off, and left. Geronimo's dream of making a quick buck fell through. Currently, he could only desperately try to complete the patrol boat orders before the deadline. He didn't want to be sent back to Havana by the enraged Governor, returning miserably to that life of a shipwright with no hope of advancement.

To add insult to injury, the Governor also ordered him to complete the refurbishment of the *Nautilus* submersible as soon as possible. Geronimo was forced to divert some of his precious manpower for this. Paulo Takayama's masterpiece enjoyed special treatment, occupying the only covered dry dock in the shipyard all by itself. The Governor was quite generous in allocating many iron parts manufactured in the munitions factory, as well as thin copper sheets used to wrap the submersible hull and well-made copper nails. They were all rolled by water-powered rolling mills, bright and shiny; Geronimo recognized them as all high-quality tin brass. But he didn't get the craftsmen he needed most. Instead, the Governor sent several soldiers to the shipyard to guard the dock where the *Nautilus* was parked day and night, guarding against "all suspicious persons."

The shipyard director had to try to recruit manpower himself. The local natives were weak and lazy, and could only do rough coolie work like moving timber. Fortunately, two new Chinese men came to the shipyard to seek work early the day before yesterday. They were actually wearing shoes, so they didn't seem to be destitute Chinese coolies, which was why they weren't dragged into the munitions factory as soon as they disembarked. Both Chinese men wore short jackets and hats, and their carpentry and painting skills were passably acceptable. Geronimo particularly noticed their strong arms; they could lift timber that would take two or three Tagalogs to move without effort. Watching the shipwrights and coolies working desperately, the shipyard director seemed to feel his headache ease a bit. He stepped out of the office, looked at the darkening sky, and ordered dinner to be served. Mr. Geronimo Paño's dinner was not so easily eaten; to be worthy of this taro soup and tuba wine not too diluted with water, that bunch of uncouth heathens had to produce a sufficient amount of work.

The night grew deeper. As usual in the tropics, a clear mist filled the night sky, shrouding the moon and forming a soft, complete colorful halo around it. The Spaniards had never established a strict night production system, so after Mr. Geronimo returned to his cool and comfortable residence, the overseers also slipped back to their huts to sleep. Most of the local coolies were drunk, stretching out their bodies under the slipways and snoring.

Faint lights could still be seen in a few places in the shipyard; these were fires lit with waste wood chips and old ship hawsers to facilitate night work. The two Chinese men were still working methodically. The thick two-man saw hissed rhythmically in their hands. Mr. Geronimo had ordered them to prepare enough timber for tomorrow's use. Occasionally, a ball of fire would light up beside the covered dry dock in the distance; that was the soldiers sent by the Governor patrolling with torches.

However, by midnight, all the noise in the shipyard gradually ceased. The two strong Chinese men also slowed down their work; it seemed they also felt tired and needed rest. The Chinese finally dropped the saw and walked toward that dark covered dry dock. No one saw their actions; even if they did, they would only think the two wanted to find a quiet place to sleep.

Two colonial soldiers sat behind the dry dock smoking. The torches had burned out, but the patrol around the dry dock would continue until someone came to relieve them after sunrise. It was both boring and tiring. The strange olive-shaped vessel under the roof could arouse their curiosity at first, but patrolling and guarding such a boat all day was truly boring to death.

Light footsteps came from ahead. A soldier looked up alertly, one hand grasping the matchlock gun leaning against the dock wall. He quickly let go. It turned out to be the two off-duty Chinese craftsmen walking this way. Both wore hats, and the moonlight shone on their naked upper bodies, glistening with sweat. They had worn-out short jackets draped over their shoulders.

Both colonial soldiers were Pampangans recruited from Macabebe. They didn't understand Chinese, but they were used to the pitiful fawning manner revealed involuntarily by Philippine Chinese when facing colonial soldiers. The Chinese men who walked up bowed, holding their clothes in their hands, pointing at the soldiers' cheroot cigars, and mimed a few lighting motions. The Pampangan mercenaries decided these two Chinese were here to borrow a light. One took out a flint and tinder pouch from his bosom, waved it in front of the Chinese men, then stuffed it back into his pocket, waiting for the Chinese to show disappointed and pained expressions after being fooled. Compared to getting whipped by the sergeant on the drill ground, this trick was much more interesting.

The Chinese men's actions suddenly became very strange. The Pampangan soldier panicked, feeling his arm suddenly pinned. Instinctively, he wanted to open his mouth and shout, but the ragged clothes held in the other's hand had already sealed his mouth, letting out only a few muffled gurgles blocked in his chest. A cold blade pierced his windpipe, and the colonial soldier's life ended there, falling dead on the cold ground together with his companion.
