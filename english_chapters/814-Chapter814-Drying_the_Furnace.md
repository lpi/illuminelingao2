# Chapter 814 - Drying the Furnace

"Human sacrifice?" Ma Qianzhu was taken aback. "Old Wen, that's not very scientific."

"Scientific or not, people say casting swords requires jumping into the furnace. For something this big, maybe we need several people?" Wen Desi joked.

The surrounding people chuckled, but the naturalized workers nearby shuddered—the Chief Chief's joke was truly terrifying.

At 2:15 PM, the ignition time arrived. Ji Wusheng climbed to the furnace platform and took a torch from a worker. He first raised it high to show the audience below, then shoved it into a tuyere.

The dry shavings inside ignited instantly. Flames burst forth. Seeing the fire, workers at other tuyeres also inserted their torches. Soon, flames were roaring at all eight tuyeres.

"Turn on the blower!" Ji Wusheng ordered.

The blower began to operate, sending air into the furnace. The fire inside grew fiercer, and white smoke began to pour from the top of the furnace—this was the moisture evaporating.

"Success!"

Applause and cheers erupted from below. Ji Wusheng let out a long breath. The ignition was successful. But this was just the beginning.

"Adjust the blast volume!"

The drying process was slow and tedious. The fire had to be controlled to ensure the temperature rose gradually, drying out the moisture in the lining without cracking it due to rapid thermal expansion.

Ji Wusheng stayed on the platform, constantly checking the temperature readings and adjusting the blast. He didn't sleep that night.

By the next morning, the white smoke had turned into blue smoke—the wood and coke were burning well, and the moisture was largely gone.

"Prepare for the second stage!"

The second stage involved gradually adding charge and increasing the blast volume. This was a critical period. If the charge wasn't added correctly or the blast was too strong or too weak, it could lead to "freezing"—where the molten iron and slag solidified at the bottom, ruining the furnace.

Workers began to hoist skips of coke, limestone, and ore to the top of the furnace. The bell valve opened, and the charge fell into the furnace throat.

"Keep an eye on the gas seal!" Ji Wusheng reminded the foreman. The top gas contained a high concentration of carbon monoxide—it was lethal.

The operation continued smoothly. The furnace temperature rose steadily. The molten iron began to accumulate at the bottom.

Forty-eight hours later, it was time for the first tap.

"Open the taphole!"

A worker used a long iron rod to drill open the clay plug at the taphole. A stream of dazzling, golden-yellow molten iron shot out, flowing down the iron runner into the sand molds prepared on the ground.

"Iron! It's iron!"

Cheers erupted again. This time, they were even louder and more enthusiastic. The sight of molten iron flowing like water was far more impactful than just smoke and fire.

Senior officers from the Army and Navy watched the flowing iron with greedy eyes—in their view, this wasn't iron, but cannons, rifles, shells, and armored ships!

"With this, we can finally expand the army," Dongmen Chuiyu whispered to the officer beside him.

"And build more ships," the naval officer added.

Wu De watched the scene with relief. The industrial heart of Lingao had finally started beating strongly. With this constant flow of iron, their development would enter a fast lane.

However, Ji Wusheng knew his work wasn't done. The first tap was just the start. Stabilizing production, improving quality, and extending the furnace's life—these were long-term tasks.

"Take a sample for analysis," he ordered. He needed to know the composition of the pig iron to adjust the furnace operation.

A worker used a long-handled spoon to scoop a bit of molten iron and poured it into a small mold. After it cooled, it would be sent to the lab.

The first tap produced about 15 tons of pig iron. The quality was decent—slightly high in sulfur, but usable. This was expected for the first batch.

"Not bad," Ji Wusheng said to the exhausted shift foreman. "Good work, everyone. The cafeteria has prepared roast pork for you tonight!"

"Long live the Head of State!" the workers cheered. For them, a good meal was the best reward.
