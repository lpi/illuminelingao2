# Chapter 1196 - Preparations

"Then we can only destroy both the people and the ship at sea to leave no trace—take away what can be dismantled and transported, and just abandon the ship."

"But don't expect it to be that perfect. Killing everyone to silence them is easy, but can we guarantee every participating Navy and Marine soldier will keep their mouth shut? Besides, it's a pity to abandon a large galleon with considerable transport capacity." Ma Qianzhu turned to the finance department: "What impact would 230,000 pesos have on our finances?"

Cheng Dong flipped open a small notebook and answered: "This income can greatly increase our precious metal reserves. We currently need to import massive amounts of bulk commodities, especially grain. Industrial exports temporarily cannot fully offset the foreign trade deficit, so the more silver and precious metal income, the better for us. Especially with the future promotion of circulation notes, we inevitably need to mint large quantities of silver coins as reserves." He was extremely sensitive about the reserve issue.

Qian Shuiting said: "Resultingly, I think it doesn't matter even if the Spanish find out. Given Spanish naval strength in East Asia, they simply cannot contend with us. Secondly, seizing the ship is equivalent to cutting off a major economic source for Zheng Zhilong. The Spanish in the Philippines rely heavily on trade with China; one could say: without the import of Chinese goods and labor, they couldn't stay in the Philippines for a single day. As long as we replace Zheng Zhilong's position and the Navy controls trade with the Philippines, the Governor-General will have no other choice but to pinch his nose, acknowledge the debt, and continue trading with us—incidentally, this operation was originally a one-off deal to strike at Zheng Zhilong; in the long run, trade yields more profit than robbery."

"Too bad, I planned to rob it for ten years in a row," an Elder sighed.

"Those who establish and maintain world order get the biggest returns. You only need to look at the United States in the old timeline to know," Qian Shuiting said.

As for the impact on combat and shipping, it wouldn't be too great. From July, the Navy and merchant fleet would begin resting and reorganization. Except for a few ships maintaining normal shipping on scheduled routes, most shipping would come to a complete halt. Both ships and sailors were plentiful.

Regarding the dispatched formation, Qian Shuiting's plan was a mixed formation of two Type 901 gunboats plus the *Feiyun*. The 901's mobility and firepower were keys to victory. The one-way journey alone was a thousand nautical miles, and time was tight, making it impossible to use sailboats requiring significant transit time. Additionally, search and pursuit at sea required high speed and good maneuverability. These were things sailing ships couldn't achieve.

As for the *Feiyun*, it would mainly provide navigation and weather services for the formation. This was extremely important for a fleet penetrating the maze-like waterways of the Philippine archipelago. Secondly, the surface search radar on board was significant for searching for targets.

This capital wasn't too large for the Senate and Navy, but the potential loss of the *Feiyun*, a modern sailboat brought from the old timeline, would still be heartbreaking.

However, to have one hundred percent assurance, *Feiyun*'s participation was indispensable—unless the Navy was willing to allocate a Type 8154 cruiser to replace its role. But the diesel consumption would be unacceptable to the Planning Commission. At least the *Feiyun* could use sails half the time and engines the other half.

Chen Haiyang looked at the map, pondered for a while, and said: "I suggest the route be this: the formation departs Hainan eastward, passes through the Balintang Channel, rounds Luzon Island to the south, goes straight to the eastern mouth of the San Bernardino Strait, and then begins the search. Such a route is far from major merchant shipping lanes and not easily discovered. It also avoids hydrographically complex shallow waterways along the way, making it safer. However, entering the Philippine archipelago in July brings a high probability of encountering typhoons. You know our Navy has never conducted long-distance blue-water voyages until now. Back then, our Navy leaving the First Island Chain once was a major event."

"We found no typhoon records for July 1632. Besides, if there really is a typhoon, wouldn't those two ships also be in Manila? Our ships are at least sturdier than theirs."

"I'm afraid typhoons can't really be verified by checking historical records. Typhoon generation is random." Someone expressed dissatisfaction with Qian Shuiting's remark.

"The *Feiyun* has weather radar, which can provide some early warning—in case of a typhoon, we can seek shelter in time. In the worst case, we can at least ensure human safety."

There wasn't much heated discussion afterward. Xiao Zishan saw several heads of industrial and agricultural departments wanting to speak, but upon hearing few ships would be used, they visibly relaxed and began whispering in small "soy sauce" groups. Not bad, not bad; this meeting actually didn't go off-topic the whole time, truly rare.

"I say, Cheng Dong, if we aren't issuing paper currency now and keeping silver is temporarily useless, can you allocate it to us in the heavy industry sector?" Zhan Wuya eyed the silver not yet in hand. "Anyway, keeping silver with you earns no interest and won't spawn little ingots. Making it into wires for us wouldn't be bad. We're consistently short of copper now; the Army and Navy are both fighting for it."

The discussion immediately became lively.

"That's worse than lending it to our Heaven and Earth Society for loans."

"Old Zhan, aren't you afraid I'll put up a sign 'No Copper in Wires, But There is Silver,' guaranteeing your wires will be cut clean in one night? Hahaha."

"You bumpkin, don't you know the electromagnets at Oak Ridge in WWII used silver wires? The shipyard and forge should have electromagnets; that would be much more convenient. Who dares steal silver in a factory, aren't they afraid of eating Minié balls?"

"How do you insulate?"

"Didn't the chemical sector make raw lacquer?"

"It's said silver stored in vaults loses one percent annually? Then we might as well take it out and use it first."

"After the Manhattan Project finished, the silver loss at Oak Ridge was less than one-thousandth."

"Bullshit, we in Lingao don't have those 'Silver Soldiers' who can stuff fifty-tael ingots and smuggle them out."

"You might as well say Los Alamos used gold spheres to block doors."

"That legend of Silver Soldiers belongs to unofficial history. From my understanding of the Ming Dynasty, this claim isn't necessarily true. Analysis of Household Department silver reserve records in core journals suggests a high probability of exaggeration."

Facing the suddenly off-topic heated discussion, Qian Shuiting stood on the stage a bit at a loss. Xiao Zishan hurriedly stood up to smooth things over: "Alright, alright, these are matters for later, we can discuss them slowly. Ma Jia, do you think it's necessary to create some regulations here first?"

"If we want the most reasonable and legal approach for this operation, it would be declaring war on the Spanish—after all, we are deploying regular armed forces. Since a state of war exists, capturing enemy vessels and confiscating goods and ships complies with the laws of war. As for whether captives have human rights—I tend to think such a concept didn't exist in the 17th century." Ma Jia spoke with fervor. "However, the procedures for declaring war are too cumbersome, and we can't send an envoy to Manila in time. So I think we can reference some historical privateering actions. Drake's actions at sea had some elements of a joint-stock company. referencing his example, I think launching a privateering action against the Spanish Manila government is completely legal. After all, our Senate itself implies a joint-stock company. The Spanish once conducted hostile actions against Bopu Port, so our maritime retaliation is also legal..." He wanted to continue but was stopped by Wen Desi. "Very good, very good. Go draft a relevant legal basis document."

"No problem. Give me three days, and I will definitely produce a logically clear, well-argued legal document. Fully embodying our respect for the law."

As for the distribution of spoils, following the old precedent of "Type A Ship Salvage," controlled materials would go to the Planning Commission's accounts, while non-controlled materials, daily necessities, and luxury goods would be sold to all Elders via bidding. Proceeds from selling spoils would be added to each Elder's dividend quota at year-end according to shareholding ratios.

The meeting concluded successfully with no objections. This matter was considered officially "project approved," and the operation was code-named "Hunger."

"I didn't expect you guys to build such a thing." Qian Shuiting exclaimed in amazement upon seeing the "galleon" before him.

It was indeed a "ship"—hull, deck, masts, rigging... it had everything a thousand-ton galleon should have, and it was moored in the bay.

However, it couldn't move, because this galleon was actually just a full-scale model—officially called "Fixed Maritime Simulation Training Facility." It was actually built on a row of wooden piles driven into the seabed. Rather than a ship, it was more like a wooden house.

Key parts of the hull like keel and ribs were replicated one hundred percent, but only "resembled in form"—ship materials weren't processed or manufactured according to real shipbuilding techniques. The purpose was merely to provide a visual demonstration for those using this model.

"Speaking of this idea, it came precisely from your proposal." Training Superintendent Fu Sansi led Qian Shuiting onto the "ship" deck. Except for lacking sails, the three tall masts on the galleon deck were also made—but like the materials used for this "ship," they were spliced together from inferior wood; if real sails were hoisted at sea, it would disintegrate immediately.

The proposal to build this one-to-one European large ship training model came from the Navy Department. Although Qian Shuiting's proposal hadn't passed for two consecutive years, this matter inspired the Elder officers of the Navy Department: there would surely be many boarding battles aiming to capture enemy ships in the future. General small and medium ships had simple structures, and the Navy had actual ships for practice. But large ships like galleons or Dutch "yachts" with displacement over a thousand tons had three or four decks and extremely complex internal structures. If unfamiliar with the internal structure, one could easily suffer losses in combat. This was something the Navy strived to avoid.
