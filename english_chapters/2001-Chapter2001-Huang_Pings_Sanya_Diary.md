# Chapter 2001 - Huang Ping's Sanya Diary

Seeing this True Bandit smiling all over face, seeming to care not saying several "Good" words, Liang Cunhou felt uneasy in heart instead. According to his thought, with dozen police outside, and accountant brought by True Bandit inside, such big formation, nothing more than wanting his Liang Family to bow head cut flesh or even acting to weave crimes ploughing clan breaking family. Now this haha laugh counted finished?

Just when domestic servants breathed a sigh of relief secretly, Liang Cunhou became more apprehensive instead.

Finally returned to Lingao again. Pity cannot go home to look this time. Time is a bit tight.

Mood not good. Meeting Wang Muqing when reporting to Finance and Tax Bureau in afternoon. Corridor too narrow couldn't avoid, had to greet. She seemed thinned much. Can't see small dimple on left face when smiling. Standing aside was a teenager, talking and laughing, probably Young Chief right? Sigh. People just felt you played ball not bad only. I was truly wishful thinking back then. Thinking so much has what use besides adding thoughts. Pity I alienated several girls interested in me for her back then. Now all not contacting me much.

Didn't see Director Zhang. People in office said she went to Chengmai. Discussed with Zeng Juan. Since already received Assisting Check Letter, no need to wait leaders. Better set off to Sanya tomorrow morning.

People in bureau increased again. Added many sisters. Heard all are graduates of Accounting Crash Course—Sisters all look good. Thinking of female classmates when studying in Fangcaodi, truly cannot compare.

Offices are not enough. We handling matters in bureau can only borrow meeting room.

Files found in bureau are same as strip given by Director Wang: All businesses in Sanya are Tax Exempt for One Year, Half Tax for Three Years. Truly having boldness. Shi Family isn't going for this right? Specific situation see when arriving Sanya.

Took Zeng Juan to East Gate Market at night. Not far from Organ Guest House, can stroll a bit late. This Guangzhou person became villager arriving Lingao hahaha. This kid Zeng Juan's palm too leaky. When setting off still said wanting to save all travel subsidy. Result pocket out of money before strolling half East Gate Market. Originally wanted to invite him a meal at Cooperative Restaurant. Looked at water sign [price board], too expensive, forget it.

Missed dad and mom in guest house at night. Haven't seen them since going to Guangzhou. Don't know how bodies and bones are. Wrote letter back. Reply only had few sentences. All "Zhi Hu Zhe Ye" [archaic literary words]. Couldn't say a clear meaning. Probably asked Accountant Sun to write for them again.

Family matter also annoying. Since Old Master and Big Master divided family, for avoiding Servant Tax, dispersed many servants in family. Old Master, Big Master although still sympathetic to old family people, keeping dad and mom temporarily. But seeing probably won't be long. Meeting Huang Ji last time said: Old Master meaning is keeping three four people cooking washing in family is enough. Keeping no one serving around body. Thinking here heart annoyed. Dad and mom served Old Master family for a lifetime. If losing errand, what to do good? Truly headache.

Luck really good today. Originally Great Wave ship late. Arriving Sanya was all off-work time. Thought could do nothing. Unexpectedly met fellow villager in bureau. This guy obviously went to Wenchang upon graduation. How come running to Sanya in just one year. And mixed to be Person in Charge of District Bureau Office. Truly TM capable.

With fellow villager, didn't worry about eating living at night. He counted particular. Restaurant treating guest not small. Meal wine water all not bad. Felt should not be worse than Lingao Cooperative Restaurant. Heard this fellow say, because Chairman Wang returned to Lingao, their Sanya already changed from Grand Region to Special Zone—Directly short a head, belonging under Hainan Grand Region. Truly blind worrying. Where is not working. Grand Region Special Zone can pay you less wage?

Saying this Sanya really coming for first time. Didn't hear old people say having this place when small. Probably New City built by Chiefs again. All say Chiefs like Big in everything. School want big. Machine want big. Factory want big. Even woman's butt and breast want big. Truly Words of Ultimate Truth. Just saying big lighthouse in front of port. Body white thoroughly. Almost half higher than Bopu one. Also trestle pier. Five lining up. Every one comparable to widest in Bopu. Wharves full of merchant ships. Going East Ocean Going West Ocean. Port Commercial District full of various Barbarians. Crowding squeezing. Many "Yellow Tickets" doing business. Actually not few Female Barbarians. Black White all have. Looking all like ghost monsters. Heard Chiefs just like this. Even specially buying Barbarian servant girls. Truly can't understand.

Heard fellow villager say, Sanya has a special port in remote place for ships trafficking people to park. But there has wall. Outside has barb wire and trench. Also watchtower. Usually don't say entering, even approaching would be questioned by guards. Sometimes can hear gun sound. Originally felt strange. Does trafficking a few barbarian girls need such big formation? Later colleague said transported were not only barbarian women. Also hundreds thousands Southern Natives—All going to Tian Du Mine for mining. Fellow villager said miners there can't live over three years. So every year need several ships of native slaves coming.

Entering city even more extraordinary. Where is this road. Seven eight horse carriages running side by side also spacious. Causing passing road with Zeng Juan had to run in small trot. Houses in city also many. Not saying Guangzhou, even compared to Lingao also much brighter—At least Lingao doesn't have so many beautiful neat houses—Especially in Commercial District. Along street all Arcade Buildings. Walking under need not shine [by sun]. Truly comfortable.

Good things too many. Feeling more than Lingao. Local products of various places and East Ocean West Ocean. All here. Strolling a circle on street. Truly eyes dazzled. Only hate earning money too little.

Just this Sanya Finance and Tax Bureau too shabby. Still squeezing in earliest Public Office with those departments. Public Office door hangs eight nine plates. If not police pointing road, where to find.

Asked situation here when eating. Originally that reduction exemption policy was proposed by Chairman Wang when in Sanya. No wonder having such huge strength. Also no wonder new businesses building towers everywhere in this city, even Overseas Barbarians come to join fun. Conversely Grand Magistrate Liu ruled Guangzhou City for almost two years. Don't say reduction exemption, even a specific preference don't have. How to compare with Sanya oh. Don't know how long this Number One Commercial Port hat can wear. Looks like Chiefs also particular about having backer in court to do things easily.

Went to Shi Family's Tianrui Garden to check accounts today. Tax officer interfacing in morning was a female comrade. Age not big tied braid looking quite neat a person. Climbed friendship. Originally Junior Sister one year below me. Good to talk being acquaintance. Did desk bottom-touching in bureau first. Tianrui Garden actually belongs to characteristic enterprise joint venture with Senate Wood Processing Factory. Main hitting special product Red White Rattan products. Amazing, amazing.

Junior Sister is a heart-fine person. Don't look working less than a year. Information of every household in jurisdiction already rolled melon ripe. Heard her say not long after Guangzhou liberation this Shi Family applied Joint Venture Permit from Lingao. Also entered as Sanya Introduced Merchant. Land almost counted white giving. Used Chiefs' big machines. Things good and cheap. Now business very red fire. Every month has big ship specially sending goods out. Saying now among new produced rattan products under Senate rule his family can occupy one quarter.

But her mouth is a bit broken [gossipy?]. Later said something Shi Family Second Young Master appearance dignified, treating people gentle, temperament confucian elegant etc. Don't know which eye she saw. I obviously saw that Shi Second Young Master in Guangzhou. A body of fat. Doubt very much if she has misunderstanding about appearance dignified.

When going for field check in afternoon bureau sent Deputy Director of Assessment Division to follow. Sanya Bureau counting Director totally only twenty-something people. Very valued. Mood very good.

Tallied with Zeng Juan. Checking General Ledger first. Accountant is also Senior Brother from our Vocational Class. Acquaintance again. Saved many troubles. Accounts look quite neat roughly. A bit inventory loss at end of last year harmless. Just watching such big running water [cash flow] cannot pay tax truly heart painting. Accrual and Payment of recent small half year all normal. Just this kid Zeng Juan, rashly asked why last year mid-year several large remittances of hundred thousands from Guangzhou didn't move after turning into Paid-in Capital. Almost let Senior Brother see joke. Truly losing Finance and Tax Bureau face.

Streets suddenly martial law at noon. Every intersection had police standing guard. National Army also moved out. Facing big enemy. Returning office alert also raised. Everyone didn't know what happened. Later knew a team of Mine Slaves in mine rioted. Killed two guards. Although suppressed on spot. But seven eight people escaped. Rumored killed several common people on running road—These people truly miserable. Killed by people without reason.

Heard dog bark and gun sound faintly at night. Later news came. People all caught. News said three beat to death on spot. Five remaining probably public execution back in mine area. I and Zeng Juan were somewhat frightened about this matter. Fellow villager very calm instead. He said such matter often happens.

Weekend, Overtime.

Quite embarrassed. We busy needing Senior Brother Junior Sister accompany suffering. If not for Finance and Tax Bureau having rules truly should treat them.

According to today speed. Probably finish work next Wednesday. Indeed nothing to argue. Besides Workshop Accountant and Cashier, two managing accounts are both our Vocational School Senior Brothers. Accounts made unknown how much higher than those half-way monk Old Advisors in Guangzhou City.

Today mainly looked at current accounts of warehouse leased by Tianrui Garden in Hong Kong. Hong Kong is Half Levy. So several tax tickets used for offsetting payment still on road. Very normal. Find time return bureau let Hall check Collection Organ Association of Payment Certificate another day. This Zeng Juan dead brain. Insisting on checking stroke by stroke there. Not disliking tired. Let him go. This Civil Exam background is just different.

Stared at account book a day. Eye pain. Sleep.
