# Chapter 2001 - Huang Ping's Sanya Diary

Seeing this genuine transmigrator wearing a full smile, seemingly unconcerned as he casually spoke several reassuring words, Liang Cunhou's heart grew uneasy instead. As he figured it, with a dozen or so police officers outside and the accountants this transmigrator had brought inside, such a massive mobilization was surely meant to force the Liang family to bow their heads and surrender wealth—or perhaps even fabricate charges to destroy the clan entirely. Yet now it ended with just a laugh and a wave?

Just as the household servants were secretly sighing with relief, Liang Cunhou found himself growing even more apprehensive.

Finally back in Lingao again, though unfortunately I can't go home for a visit this time. Time is a bit tight.

My mood is poor. While reporting to the Finance and Taxation Bureau this afternoon, I ran into Wang Muqing. The corridor was too narrow to avoid her, so I had to say hello. She seems to have lost a lot of weight—when she smiles now, I can't even see the little dimple on her left cheek anymore. There was a teenager standing beside her, and they were chatting and laughing together. Probably a young master from an Elder's family? Sigh. She only ever thought I was decent at playing ball—I was really deluding myself back then. Thinking about all this only adds to my troubles. What use is it? The pity is that I pushed away several girls who were interested in me because of her, and now they barely keep in touch.

I didn't get to meet Director Zhang. The people in the office said she went to Chengmai. After discussing it with Zeng Juan, since we'd already obtained the investigation authorization letter, there was no need to wait for the supervisor. Better to set off for Sanya first thing tomorrow morning.

The bureau has more staff now—lots of new young women, apparently graduates from the accounting fast-track program. The young ladies are all quite pretty—thinking back to my female classmates at Fangcaodi, there's really no comparison.

There aren't even enough offices anymore. When we came to handle business at the bureau, we had to borrow the conference room.

The files I found at the bureau matched what Director Wang's note said: all businesses in Sanya are tax-exempt for the first year and taxed at half rate for three years. Really bold policy. Could the Shi family have gone there for precisely this reason? I'll see the specific situation when I get to Sanya.

In the evening, I took Zeng Juan to East Gate Market. It's not far from the government guesthouse, so we could stay out a bit later. A Cantonese person in Lingao becomes a country bumpkin too, hahaha. This kid Zeng Juan has such loose hands with money—when we set out he said he'd save all his travel allowance, yet by the time we'd barely covered half of East Gate Market his pockets were empty. I'd wanted to treat him to a meal at the Cooperative Restaurant, but after looking at the menu board—too expensive—forget it.

At night in the guesthouse, I missed my parents. I haven't seen them since I went to Guangzhou, and I don't know how their health is. I wrote home, but the reply was just a few sentences, all written in classical literary style that doesn't say anything clear. They probably had Steward Sun write it for them again.

Family matters are worrying too. Ever since the Old Master and the Young Master split the household, they've dismissed quite a few servants to avoid the servant tax. Though the Old Master and Young Master still look after the old family retainers, and my parents are still kept on for now, it clearly won't last long. When I ran into Huang Ji last time, he said the Old Master's intention is to keep just three or four people for cooking and laundry, without anyone attending to him personally. Thinking about this makes me vexed. My parents served the Old Master's household their whole lives—if they lose their positions, what will they do? It really gives me a headache.

**August 28, 1636, Thursday. Clear.**

Today my luck was really good. The Dabo ferry was running late, and by the time we reached Sanya it was already after work hours. I thought we wouldn't get anything done. Who'd have thought I'd run into a fellow villager at the bureau! This guy clearly graduated and was assigned to Wenchang—how did he end up in Sanya after just one year, and even become the head of the district bureau's office? Really damn capable.

With a fellow villager here, I didn't have to worry about food and lodging tonight. He's pretty decent—the restaurant he took us to wasn't small, and the food and drink were quite good. I'd say it's probably not worse than the Lingao Cooperative Restaurant. He said that since Secretary Wang returned to Lingao, Sanya has already gone from being a Greater Region to a Special Zone—directly downgraded a level, now subordinate to the Hainan Greater Region. What's the point of worrying about that? Whether it's a Greater Region or Special Zone, they still work and still get paid the same.

This really is my first time visiting Sanya. When I was young, I never heard the elders mention such a place—it's probably another new city named by the Elders. They say the Elders like everything big: big schools, big machines, big factories, and even big buttocks and breasts on women. How true this is! Take the big lighthouse in front of the harbor: pure white all over, nearly half again as tall as the one at Bopu. And the piers too—five of them lined up in a row, each one as wide as the widest one at Bopu. The docks are full of merchant ships heading to both Eastern and Western seas. The harbor commercial district is packed with all kinds of foreigners, crowded together. There are lots of "yellow-ticket" holders doing business, and surprisingly many foreign women—black and white ones—all looking like ghosts and goblins. I've heard the Elders like this sort of thing and even specially purchase foreign maidservants. I really don't understand.

My fellow villager said that Sanya has a special harbor in a remote area just for slave ships to dock. But there are walls around it, with barbed wire fencing and trenches outside, plus watchtowers. Normally, let alone entering, even getting close will get you questioned by guards. Sometimes you can even hear gunshots. I thought it strange at first—do they really need such a big setup for trafficking a few barbarian girls? Later, a colleague explained that what they bring in aren't just barbarian women—there are also hundreds and thousands of southern natives, all going to the Tiandu mines to dig. My fellow villager said the miners there don't live past three years, so every year several shiploads of native slaves have to be brought in.

Inside the city it's even more impressive. What kind of road is this? Seven or eight horse carts could run side by side with room to spare. When Zeng Juan and I crossed the road, we had to run at a trot just to make it across. There are lots of buildings in the city too—not compared to Guangzhou, but even compared to Lingao, things are much brighter and newer here. At least Lingao doesn't have so many beautiful, orderly buildings. Especially in the commercial district, there are arcades along all the streets—walking underneath them, you don't have to worry about the sun. Very comfortable.

There's so much good stuff here—I feel like even more than in Lingao. Local products from everywhere plus goods from Eastern and Western seas are all available here. Just walking around the streets once makes your eyes dazzle. I only regret that I don't earn enough money.

The Sanya Finance and Taxation Bureau is just too shabby though—still crammed into the original public office together with all those other departments. There are eight or nine plaques hanging at the entrance. If the police hadn't given us directions, how would we ever find it?

At dinner, I asked around about the situation here. Turns out that preferential policy was proposed when Secretary Wang was in Sanya—no wonder it has such great force. No wonder the city is full of new buildings being constructed by new trading houses, with even overseas foreigners coming to join the fun. Meanwhile, Governor Liu has been in charge of Guangzhou for nearly two years now, and forget about exemptions—there isn't even a specific preferential policy in place. How can it compare to Sanya? Who knows how long Guangzhou can hold onto the hat of "Premier Trading Port." It seems even the Elders care about having backers in the court to get things done.

**August 29, 1636, Friday. Cloudy.**

Today I went to the Shi family's Tianrui Garden to check the accounts. The tax administrator I liaised with in the morning was a female colleague. Young, with her hair in a braid—she looked like a sharp, capable person. Turns out she's a junior sister who started one cohort after me. With a familiar face, things are easier to discuss. First I did some background research at the bureau. Tianrui Garden is actually a special enterprise jointly operated with the Council of Elders' Wood Processing Factory, specializing in red and white rattan products. Quite impressive, quite impressive.

My junior sister is meticulous—though she's been on the job less than a year, she already knows the data on every household in her jurisdiction by heart. According to her, not long after Guangzhou was liberated, the Shi family obtained a joint venture permit from Lingao and then, taking advantage of the investment incentives, established themselves as a recruited merchant in Sanya. The land was practically given to them for free. Using the Elders' big machines, their goods are both excellent and cheap. Business is booming now—every month there's a big ship specifically to transport their goods out. She said that currently, among all newly produced rattan products under the Council of Elders' rule, their firm accounts for a quarter.

However, her tongue is a bit loose. Later she went on about how the Shi family's Second Young Master has an impressive bearing, is gentle in manner, refined in temperament, and so on. I don't know which eye she's looking with. When I was in Guangzhou, I clearly met that Shi Second Young Master—all rolls of fat. I strongly suspect she has some misunderstanding of what "impressive bearing" means.

In the afternoon, when we went for the on-site audit, the bureau sent an assistant director from the Assessment Division to accompany us. Including the bureau chief, there are only about twenty people at the Sanya bureau—they're quite attentive indeed. This put me in a good mood.

After discussing with Zeng Juan, we looked at the general ledger first. The accountant is also a senior schoolmate who graduated from our vocational program—another familiar face, which saved us a lot of trouble. At first glance, the accounts look neat enough. There's a bit of inventory loss at the end of last year, nothing serious. It's just that looking at such a large cash flow not being taxed really makes my heart ache. The accruals and tax payments for the recent half year are all normal. It's just that Zeng Juan, this rash kid—he rashly asked why there were several large remittances of over a hundred thousand from Guangzhou in the middle of last year that were converted to paid-in capital and then never touched. He nearly made our senior schoolmate laugh at us—really an embarrassment to the Finance and Taxation Bureau.

At noon, the streets suddenly went under martial law. There were police standing guard at every intersection, and the National Army was mobilized too. An atmosphere of high alert. Back at the office, security had been heightened as well. Nobody knew what had happened. Later we learned that a squad of mine slaves at the mining site had revolted, killing two guards. Although they were suppressed on the spot, seven or eight people escaped. On their escape route, they reportedly killed several civilians—those poor people, killed for no reason at all.

At night, I could faintly hear dogs barking and gunshots. Later came news that everyone had been caught. Word was that three were shot dead on the spot, and the other five would probably be publicly executed at the mining district. This incident had both Zeng Juan and me quite frightened, but my fellow villager was very calm. He said this kind of thing happens often.

Weekend. Working overtime.

I feel rather embarrassed—while we're busy working, our senior and junior schoolmates have to work alongside us. If it weren't for the Finance and Taxation Bureau's rules, I really should treat them to dinner.

At the pace we're going today, we should be able to wrap up by about Wednesday next week. There really isn't much to quibble about. Apart from the workshop accountant and cashier, both people managing the books are schoolmates from our vocational school. Their bookkeeping is far superior to those half-trained old clerks in Guangzhou city—it's not even comparable.

Today I mainly looked at the transaction records for the warehouse Tianrui Garden leases in Hong Kong. Hong Kong is taxed at half rate, so there are a few tax receipts for offset payments still in transit. Very normal. I'll find time later to go back to the bureau and have the main hall check the collecting agency copies of the tax clearance certificates. Zeng Juan, that stubborn fool, insists on matching them up entry by entry. Let him be. These civil service exam graduates really are different.

Stared at ledgers all day. My eyes hurt. Going to sleep.
