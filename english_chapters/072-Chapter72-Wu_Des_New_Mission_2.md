# Chapter 72 - Wu De's New Mission (2)

"About this, I think it's better for you to continue engaging in biological engineering, which is more helpful to the great cause of transmigration."

"If you don't like my smoked fish, just say so." Hu Yicheng said resentfully, "Forget it, I just finished dissecting a rabbit..."

"Rabbit?!" Wu De (Note: At the request of the extra himself, Zhao De is changed to Wu De. The "Zhao De" mentioned in the previous text is "Wu De", will be modified together when there is time) shivered, this is good stuff.

"Caught yesterday," Hu Yicheng smiled very much like a fox, "Planning to roast it for lunch."

"Lunch?" Wu De thought not without regret that he would be standing guard at the construction site at that time, surely unable to eat roast rabbit meat.

"But I can save a front leg for you..."

Wu De was just about to thank him, when he suddenly remembered the old saying: One who is unaccountably solicitous is hiding evil intentions. This Little Hu is not familiar with him, why invite him to eat rabbit meat?

Sure enough, Hu Yicheng's fox tail immediately showed: "Yesterday, um, I saw you making seafood rice, this, can I join you for meals here?"

"Sure, but you have to bring your own rice." Wu De said very frankly, seafood rice tastes better when made in larger quantities.

"That would be great, I can also learn by the way." He pointed to the direction of the back kitchen, "Group Leader Wu just came back, caught more than ten baskets of fish in the morning, trying to figure out how to process them."

"Process? Then I have to go and see, don't let them spoil it again." This space-time is indeed rich in resources.

"I'll take you there." Hu Yicheng probably admired Wu De's cooking skills very much, and upon hearing that he was coming to guide the cooking, was naturally eager for it.

In the back, using tree trunks as pillars, a canvas shed was built, steaming hot inside. A row of large pots was set up, people burning fire, chopping wood, carrying water, busy and happy... there were surprisingly a few women inside! Wu De thought fortunately he had the foresight to put on a pair of briefs, otherwise he would have become an exhibitionist.

As soon as he entered the "kitchen", he saw a guy burying his head in work with a laptop. Little Hu went up to greet him: "Nanhai, someone is coming to make fish for us!"

Wu Nanhai looked up: "Ah De? You fisherman, why haven't I seen you on the boat recently?" Looked him up and down again, "Haven't seen you for a few days, looking like a native now."

"Wasn't I serving as a sentry? Used to be a sailor, now became a marine." He glanced at himself, stripped naked and lean, skin originally dark, now shirtless and barefoot, wearing only small briefs... this image is really earthy enough.

"Nanhai, aren't you in the Agriculture Team? Not engaging in vegetable greenhouses, raising chickens and feeding pigs, but acting as a cook?"

"Xiao Zishan's idea, this brat, in order to get rid of the trouble of managing the canteen, insisted that agriculture is the problem of eating, saying it's natural for me to be the director of the Food Office." Wu Nanhai said helplessly, "Actually I want to take care of those rabbits and chickens. Those chickens probably aren't acclimated and were frightened, haven't laid an egg since getting off the ship. Don't know when they can recover. And those pigs, their health isn't very good either, refusing to eat, making one worry..." The deep affection when he spoke of those pigs, cows, sheep, chickens, and ducks made Wu De shiver.

"There are quite a few women in the Food Office, you are lucky..."

"What luck? They are all other people's wives." Wu Nanhai had no interest, "Besides, I'm not interested in modern women. If I want to raise one, I'll start from a loli. Speaking of which, the Executive Committee should send someone to Guangzhou to buy lolis, right?"

Just as they were deeply discussing major issues such as what age counts as mature for a loli and whether the direction of cultivation should be tsundere, kuudere, natural airhead, or meganekko, a fat man came in angrily. Wu Nanhai's face changed greatly upon seeing him, just about to bury his head deeper, but was pulled out by that person.

"Where is my 'Blue Lightning'?"

Wu Nanhai said with a frown: "This... restrain your grief... we buried it, you know, the weather here is hot..."

The comer's face froze, actually with tears in his eyes, flung his head and went out again. Abrupt enough to make one dumbfounded.

"Who is this?..."

Wu Nanhai said: "This is Nick Cha, returned from Australia. Brought two racehorses and some carrier pigeons this time."

Two retired racehorses "A Lan Chi" and "Blue Lightning" were both originally registered with the Australian Jockey Club, although they were a bit old. Nick Cha tried to rely on some of his knowledge in this area, envisioning to form a cavalry in the future. But after arriving here, the harsh reality dispelled his initial assumptions. Horses are sensitive animals; the noise after landing frightened "Blue Lightning". Although it was forcibly restrained by the fixed board frame, it stubbornly and repeatedly hit its head against the wooden beam on the side. Finally waited until personnel and supplies finished landing before the horses and livestock were hoisted ashore. Of course, there were no clean stables in the camp, nor could horse grass be found. In the rudimentary base, even the water people drank had to be transported from the ship, and the clean warm water necessary for the horses every day could not be provided in sufficient quantity.

"He personally ran to the Executive Committee, repeating how precious that horse was, and demanded 'at least 5 person-portions' of bean and wheat food supply daily."

"And the result?"

"Need I say? Where on the ship are there soybeans, black beans, and barley? I only have a little seed. Some grain was brought, but to save space, it was rice."

"So it was refused?"

"Correctly speaking, it was politely refused, because that bastard Xiao Zishan kicked the ball to me again!" Wu Nanhai said indignantly, "He insisted that I have the most love for animals. That's for obtaining animal products, not a question of love. Now as long as it involves living things, it's all counted on the Agriculture Team."

Probably to prove his words, the sound of dogs barking came from the place surrounded by fences behind, rising and falling for a while, then mixed with horse neighing, cow mooing, and pig grunting, chickens and ducks also joined in the fun. A cat with a bow tie on its neck drilled over again, rubbing against Wu Nanhai's trouser legs.

"This is Yang Baogui's dog. He brought five, saying they are future military and police dogs..."

"What about the horse?" Wu De still couldn't forget about the racehorse.

"Embarrassing to say, he personally delivered the horses and pigeons, and told me to take good care of these 'friends who can't speak'." Wu Nanhai casually fished a small fish from the basket on the side and threw it to the kitten, "I haven't learned mule and horse breeding, don't know how to raise them well. The horse refused to eat—"

Hu Yicheng beside nodded: "This horse is really hard to serve, refused to eat the grass we cut, just went on a hunger strike like this."

"Yes, seemed to be restless too." Wu Nanhai said, Nick Cha tried every way himself but couldn't calm the horse down. Few days of not eating plus the heat and flies and mosquitoes, it collapsed yesterday.

"Last night I called Yang Baogui to look. He is a vet, said it was hopeless, then it died. I didn't dare to tell Old Nick at the time..."

"That's really a pity, racehorse bloodlines are great."

"Actually nothing pity about it," Hu Yicheng looked disapproving, "All geldings, what use are eighteen or nineteen-year-old geldings?"

"I also think it's nothing," Wu Nanhai was also a bit indifferent, "Racehorses can't do farm work, can't pull carts or plow fields. Not as useful as draft horses."

"By the way, where are the fish?"

"All in that basket over there." Wu Nanhai frowned, "Don't know what to make, boiled fish in clear water every day..."

"Tomorrow there will be..."

"Shh, what are you blabbering about?" Wu Nanhai pouted towards the direction of the women in the shed, whispering, "Want to be drowned in spit? I tell you, if the secret is out, I don't know anything."

"Okay, okay."

"Rabbit meat?"

"Hey, you help brainstorm how to deal with this pile of fish first." Wu Nanhai dragged him to the basket, dripping wet, with a salty smell of the sea, making Wu De feel very familiar.

The basket had all kinds of fish, big and small, even small sharks. This thing has too strong an ammonia smell, can't be eaten without processing.

"Boiling in clear water is the best way for tasting seafood, original taste and flavor, but to use fish as a daily protein supplement, this method is too bland. My method is nothing rare, just making seafood rice or barbecue."

"Grilled fish? We don't have spices..."

"Can be made without spices, seafood rice is even simpler." He looked at his watch, almost 10 o'clock, he had to go on sentry duty at 12, just right to eat and then go. "I'll demonstrate."

"How many people's rice can that field cookware rice pot make at most?"

"Counting 4 liang of rice per person, it's a hundred person-portions."

"Okay, I'll make one pot first, then you guys make the rest."

Seeing someone willing to volunteer, Wu Nanhai quickly gathered everyone from the Food Office to await orders.

Wu De instructed everyone to clean the fish, separate them by size and variety. Red meat fish and white meat fish to be separated, fatty ones and less fatty ones to be separated, sizes also classified.

"There are many kinds of sea fish, and the ways we use them are also different. Once the catch is ashore, classify them in time, so it's easy to process."

After Wu De finished speaking, he took people to the river to pick wild vegetables. He found quite a few nearby last night: plantain, sowthistle, wild green onion, and wild perilla. Picked two bundles, washed them clean in the water, tied them with a piece of thatch grass, and brought them back together.

A large amount of firewood was thrown into the stove, and someone was specially assigned to blow the wind. Soon the fire was burning high, water boiled and rice put in. Taking advantage of the time cooking rice, he took the lead in cleaning the fish. As a demonstration, fish heads, tails, and guts were put aside, fish bodies chopped into small pieces. Shells were pried open to take out the meat. Kelp and wild vegetables were all chopped. In the time of two fires, the rice swelled, soup and water became porridge, threw fish meat, shell meat, and kelp into the pot, used a large ladle to mix rice and fish evenly, simmered for a few minutes, then threw in wild vegetables and wild green onions, simmered for one minute, sprinkled some salt, and a pot of seafood rice was done.

The fish guts cleaned out, plus small miscellaneous fish of no value, can be used to ferment fish sauce. The Food Office didn't have cement pools, but found a few large water vats from the inspection division's kitchen, so Wu De guided them to make fish sauce.

Theoretically speaking, any fish can be used to make fish sauce, but generally only small miscellaneous fish with no economic value are used. Parts of fish guts produced during processing can also be used. Add salt about 1/3 of the fish weight, mix well, cover with a bamboo strip lid on top, then press with a big stone. When fermenting, the outside temperature is best to be above 30 degrees Celsius. Wu De asked them to put the vats outdoors, which is conducive to fermentation.

"It will take a year to be ready," Wu De said, "but the taste is very delicious..."

Also taught everyone how to pickle and sun-dry fish. For a time, behind the kitchen stank to high heaven, fishy smell assaulted the nose, flies came chasing the smell, everyone couldn't stand it a bit. A girl really couldn't stand it and ran outside to vomit—she won't have the fortune to enjoy today's lunch seafood rice.
