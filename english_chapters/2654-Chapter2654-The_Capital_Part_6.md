# Chapter 2654: The Capital (Part 6)

Zhong Kai did not speak but pointed to a bottle of *Guoshi Wushuang* placed on the wine table. Everyone felt startled in their hearts, knowing that what Zhong Kai pointed at was absolutely not the wine itself, but the meaning behind this *Guoshi Wushuang*.

"Just now, a report came from the yamen saying that news of instability came from Delong Bank today. It is heard that the manager is nowhere to be found. In the afternoon, they suspended remittance business to Guangdong," Zhong Kai paused here and continued, "Tomorrow, there will probably be long queues at the entrance of Delong Bank. The stewards of various households will be busy for a while."

"He is a big living person; how did he disappear in broad daylight?"

"Could he be hiding?"

"Back then when Delong almost closed down, he only disappeared for a few days. Now that it's calm and tranquil, why is the person gone?"

"Hard to say..."

For a moment, opinions varied, and everyone was puzzled. When the news of the fall of Guangzhou came, Delong Bank also reported news of instability, which once triggered a run on the bank. Shuntian Prefecture had to send people to protect it and maintain order. However, not long after, this atmosphere of unease unexpectedly vanished like smoke and scattered like clouds. Zhong Kai had not yet been appointed Shuntian Prefecture Yin at that time, but he had roughly heard that because this bank involved too many high officials and nobles, especially eunuchs in the palace, the matter was eventually left unsettled.

When Zhong Kai first took office as Shuntian Prefecture Yin, he also paid quite a bit of attention to this bank. However, Delong had always acted in a low-key and rigorous manner. Apart from visiting clients' residences, the manager and clerks rarely went out on ordinary days. The gates were heavily guarded; let alone approaching, outsiders couldn't even hear a sentence from inside.

An important duty of Shuntian Prefecture was to maintain local security. Over time, seeing that they made no unusual moves and the court had no decrees, Zhong Kai gradually stopped paying attention. He hadn't expected such a case to suddenly occur!
Needless to say, tomorrow his desk would be piled with calling cards asking him to help "investigate" this matter—not just him, but also the Wardens' Office of the Five Wards, the Eastern Depot, the Embroidered Uniform Guard... mostly any yamen involved in catching thieves and public security in the capital would receive them. If the matter was not handled well, it would probably alarm the Emperor.

Thinking of this, Zhong Kai was in no mood to drink anymore. He instructed his subordinates and private secretaries to "continue enjoying yourselves," while he quietly left Liuquan Ju with his attendants and returned to the Shuntian Prefecture Yamen in a sedan chair.

The clerk on duty saw the Prefecture Yin suddenly return and hurriedly got up to welcome him. Zhong Kai looked at the items on the table, his face becoming even more grave. Without wasting words, he asked, "Is Judge Lord Liu here?"

The clerk said, "Lord Liu went home at the sounding of the first watch..."

"Send someone to Lord Liu's residence immediately and say I invite him to return to the yamen at once."

The clerk dared not delay and hurriedly agreed and went. The private secretary in charge of criminal justice beside Zhong Kai said, "Master, it is already almost the third watch now. Whatever it is, it won't be too late to discuss it tomorrow morning. Why call Lord Liu here in the middle of the night? It's pitch black, and we can't handle cases anyway..."

"No, arrangements must be made before dawn for this matter." Zhong Kai said in a low voice, "There are too many deities from all sides in the capital. The disappearance of one Manager Leng—who knows how many people will be implicated. Roughly many people will lose sleep tonight—bring the man here; I will question him personally."

What made him return to the yamen immediately was not the rumor of Delong's instability, but a more unexpected piece of news. This news, to some extent, confirmed the rumor of Leng Ningyun's disappearance.

In just a moment, the bailiffs brought the reporter of the case over. Zhong Kai took a look: the comer looked impoverished, wearing a short hemp garment that was already patched a hundred times like quail feathers, but over it, he wore a sheepskin vest, and his calves were also wrapped in sheepskin leggings—this attire was that of a carter who traveled long distances.

"What is your name?" Zhong Kai asked.

The carter was already bewildered: he had never entered such a large yamen before. At this moment, in the pitch-black hall with a single bean-sized lamp, a strictly dressed official in red robes and cap sat in the center, looking just like the City God in the temple. He had long been scared out of his wits. Kneeling on the ground, he shivered continuously and couldn't say half a word. The bailiff beside him kicked him, demanding him to reply.

"Do not frighten him; let him reply calmly." Zhong Kai instructed the bailiff and asked again, "This official is the Shuntian Prefecture Yin. Since you have a case to report today, do not delay the matter!"

"Yes, yes," the carter finally came back to his senses. He hurriedly reported, "This small one is named Jiang Quanwang, making a living by driving carts. Yesterday evening, this small one went to Haidian to pull goods. When it was almost dark, at a place four or five *li* away from Xizhimen, I encountered bandits blocking the road..."

To say blocking the road, they were not blocking him, but the large cart in front of him was robbed by bandits. Although the twilight was hanging low and he couldn't see clearly, he could still distinguish the sounds of fighting.

Jiang Quanwang naturally dared not move forward—fortunately, his cart was empty and flexible in turning, so he immediately drove the mule off the main road and hid temporarily in the graveyard by the roadside.

"...After a while, I heard a team of horses galloping past on the main road, heading northwest. Only after they passed did I drive the cart back."

After walking less than two *li*, he saw an overturned carriage by the roadside.

This carriage was neither a flatbed cart used for both goods and people, nor a "mule cart" hired by ordinary people for long-distance travel, but a four-wheeled "Australian" carriage that had become popular only in recent years. Because this kind of carriage was comfortable to ride in and had a beautiful appearance, it quickly became popular among the wealthy households in the capital. Some rental agencies also bought this kind of carriage to provide rental services.

In short, those who rode in Australian carriages were either rich or noble. Jiang Quanwang thus had evil thoughts, wanting to see if there were any foreign windfalls to pick up in the carriage. He immediately got out of his cart and groped his way over.

"...There were four corpses inside and outside the carriage. The ground was full of blood, and there were also swords left behind." Jiang Quanwang was still in shock when he spoke of this. He rummaged through the carriage and the bodies, and actually managed to get some small items and a few taels of silver.

He had originally thought he had made a small fortune, but he didn't expect that when entering Xizhimen, the soldiers at the gate saw bloodstains on his clothes and detained him on the spot. After some interrogation, he was sent to Shuntian Prefecture.

"...Master! Master! This person was not killed by this small one! This small one shouldn't have been blinded by money to search the bodies, but I really didn't lift a hand!!!!"

Jiang Quanwang knocked his head repeatedly to beg for mercy. He had already suffered quite a bit at the city gate, and was scared to pee in this Shuntian Prefecture Yamen—if this murder case of four people was pinned on his head, it would be eternal damnation and decapitation!

Zhong Kai ignored him and only asked the criminal justice private secretary, "Has Wanping County gone to the scene to survey?"

"When this person was caught entering the city, the city gates were almost closed..."

Once the gates of the capital were closed, unless there was a special decree, no one could open the locks to enter or exit. So this scene survey could only wait until tomorrow morning.

There would be pedestrians on the main road early in the morning, and people and carts would come and go on the official road. In these years, poor people were bold. Seeing an overturned carriage, nine out of ten would go to "scoop a handful" like Jiang Quanwang. If they went late, maybe even the carriage would be gone.

At this moment, someone reported that Judge Liu had arrived. Zhong Kai ordered the bailiffs to take Jiang Quanwang into the prison for custody and instructed the private secretary:

"You go to the prison yourself and question him carefully. Do not let go of a single thread from beginning to end."

"Yes, this student will go right away."

The private secretary took the order and left. On this side, Shuntian Prefecture Judge Liu Yike had already arrived.

Judge Liu had been called out of his warm bedding in the middle of the night and was already holding a bellyful of fire. Although a Judge was a subordinate of the Prefecture Yin, both were court-appointed officials with no distinction of high or low status, so he came with a long face. He grumbled, "What urgent matter requires handling duty in the dead of night!"

However, Zhong Kai was known for being "upright and honest," so Judge Liu dared not touch this bad luck. After a hasty greeting, Zhong Kai did not stand on ceremony with him either and introduced the current situation to him.

Hearing this, Liu Yike became even more dissatisfied in his heart. Such cases of robbing and killing travelers and carriages were nothing new nowadays. Although the capital was the "Place of Supreme Goodness" of the Great Ming, in reality, public security was not good. Let alone on the official roads outside the city, even inside the city and even within the imperial parks, cases of robbery and murder were commonly seen.

Nine out of ten of these cases resulted in the failure to apprehend the murderer. Even after Zhong Kai, who had always been known for being clean and upright, took office, he had not fundamentally reversed the situation, but only slightly improved it.

"The Prefecture Yin's meaning is..."

"As soon as the city gates open tomorrow, you take people to survey the scene." Zhong Kai said, "This case is of great importance; I'm afraid the Emperor will also ask about it."

When Zhong Kai said this, Liu Yike finally became alert. He said, "Who plainly is involved in this case?"

"Manager Leng of Delong."

"It's him?!" Only then did Liu Yike realize the seriousness of the matter. This Delong not only involved the Hair Rebels but also had connections with many big shots in the capital and the palace. If something happened to this person, there would probably be an earthquake in the capital instantly. He hurriedly asked, "This Manager Leng..."

Zhong Kai took a coarse cloth bundle, opened it, and spread it on the table. Inside were precisely the scattered things Jiang Quanwang had scavenged from the victims. A few pieces of broken silver, a portable ink box, an abacus, a stack of bosom paper, a small tin medicine box... mostly items carried by people going out for business. Opening the small medicine box, there was an inconspicuous small ox horn leisure seal inside. Carved on it was obscure bird seal script. Zhong Kai recognized it; it was actually just the character "Yun."

Zhong Kai had seen this cipher seal—it was exactly what Leng Ningyun carried with him. Added to the fact that both the ink box and the abacus had the words "Delong Bank" on them, only then did he conclude that the carriage that had been robbed and whose occupants killed not only contained people from Delong but was also related to Leng Ningyun.

This alone could not determine that Leng Ningyun had met with mishap, but judging from the discovery of this cipher seal, the possibility of Leng being in this carriage was very high.

"This small ox horn seal is Manager Leng's cipher; he carries it with him on ordinary days."

"So..." Liu Yike said.

"That's right," Zhong Kai nodded. " The current situation is still unclear. Brother, I need you to go and survey the scene. I will send more people to Delong to inquire. If Manager Leng is safe and sound, that would be best. Otherwise, I'm afraid you and I will both have a headache."

"I'll go as soon as the sky turns light." Liu Yike showed none of the unwillingness he had just now and responded immediately, "I'll bring a few old hands from the Fast Squad."
