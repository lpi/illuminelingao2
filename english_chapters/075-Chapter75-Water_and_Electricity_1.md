# Chapter 75 - Water and Electricity (1)

This locomobile used for power generation was originally intended to be installed in the main urban area, but due to its serious pollution, flying soot, loud noise, and the boiler needing a large amount of water, it was finally installed in the hydropower area. For flood control, the foundations of the thermal power station, power distribution room, and substation in the hydropower area were specially raised.

Although the locomobile has many benefits for the transmigrators, the fuel it requires daily is also considerable, not to mention that the boiler needs soft water. Transporting distilled water from the ship to the machine is a bit too extravagant. If using natural water, rainwater is the best, river water can also make do, but it is best to undergo softening treatment. Luo Duo said he could make tannin extract for water softening, but for a while there was no place to find raw materials for him. Finally, Wang Luobin, based on his experience in the countryside, said that boiled water could be used as a substitute.

Boiling water for this behemoth was a bit funny. A line of stoves was dug on the river beach, and the pots brought from the ship were all unloaded to boil water. The flames were raging, steam filled the air, and for a time it was incomparable magnificent. The transmigrators threw themselves into the work of cutting grass and logging again, and various firewood piled up like small hills.

"Why not use diesel generators?" Wen Desi saw such a magnificent scene with no excitement. In his opinion, this was simply a waste of time and manpower. It is true that the locomobile can run without oil, but the manpower consumed like this cannot be called economical at all.

The operation of high-horsepower locomobiles requires hardened ground—not only the foundation of the locomobile, but the entire urban area needs ground hardening work, especially the upcoming simple housing residential area and the streets of the urban area.

The transmigrators did not have bricks yet, but making concrete was very convenient. Cement and steel bars were transported with the ship, and there were as many stones as needed at Bairen Beach—Bairen Beach had historically been Lingao's quarry. Stones were not only supplied for use within the county but also sold to neighboring counties. After the transmigrators arrived, the stonemasons all ran away. Many of the stone pieces they mined and polished remained, and there was also a large amount of crushed stone waste left after mining in the quarry—there was plenty of river sand on the river beach, which could be used after screening. Cement and mixers were brought from Bopu. Making concrete also required wooden molds. Wu Kuangming established an electric sawmill in Bopu, which could conveniently cut wood of various sizes, and soon the wooden molds were made and transported.

After completing the ground hardening of the locomobile power station, the Architecture Team simply started the hydropower project in one go. After all, boiling water to feed the boiler every day was not a sustainable way. Moreover, with the relocation of the Executive Committee's office departments and residential areas and the establishment of new industrial zones, electricity consumption would soon increase significantly. By then, this amount of electricity would not be enough.

The Energy Team listed the Bairen Beach Hydropower Station as a key project in the energy plan and had a full set of design drawings for the power station on hand. However, after meeting and consulting with the Architecture Team, everyone agreed that it was currently beyond their ability to construct completely according to this plan.

The Bairen Beach Hydropower Station, which started construction after the Spring Festival in 1967 and was completed at the end of 1968, has a dam length of 94 meters and a height of 7.5 meters, as well as supporting gates, culverts, channels, aqueducts, water pipes... Even in 20th-century Lingao, it was a major project completed with the power of the whole county. Starting from mobilizing more than 300 organ cadres and more than 100 hydropower engineering personnel, to conscripting hundreds of migrant workers from the whole county, and specially transferring more than 200 fisherwomen capable of carrying heavy burdens from the three communes of Touju, Huanglong, and Kunshe to carry large stones. The labor input alone reached 64,000 workdays, completing 51,800 cubic meters of earthwork, 5,110 cubic meters of masonry, and pouring 630 cubic meters of concrete...

These numbers were simply astronomical for the transmigrators, so the full set of drawings could only be temporarily stored. Finally, it was decided to adopt a simple channel diversion type power station. Installing a 200KW generator.

The design plan was first to excavate a diversion channel upstream of the nine-level waterfall at Bairen Beach. The width and depth of the diversion channel were calculated based on water flow and slope. Fortunately, there were ready-made data tables to check. Finally, the scale of the diversion channel was determined to be 1.5 meters bottom width and 1 meter water depth.

The diversion channel injects water into the forebay, which connects the diversion channel and the pressure pipe. It consists of a forechamber, trash rack, gate, intake chamber, spillway, and sand discharge outlet.

The forebay is an important component of the hydropower station. It is not only used to settle sediment and intercept drifting debris to avoid entering the turbine and causing damage, but also plays a role in distributing water volume when there are multiple units. In addition, its main function is to regulate the amount of water entering the turbine.

When the load of the hydropower station increases and the flow required by the turbine increases, the reservoir in the forechamber can supplement the insufficient incoming water from the channel to avoid the water level dropping and causing air to be sucked into the pressure pipe, reducing the unit output; conversely, when the load suddenly decreases, or upstream incoming water is excessive causing flooding, the excess flow in the channel can be discharged through the spillway to avoid affecting the safety of the buildings.

The gate of the water channel is used to control flow and intercept water, set in the water delivery chamber of the forebay. Because it is a small hydropower station, it was decided to use wood to make this gate. Wang Luobin, based on what he saw and heard in the countryside, recommended a wooden radial gate popular during the * period. It uses a pulley block and a hand-cranked wooden winch when opening, and relies on gravity moment for closing. The structure is simple, opening and closing are quick, and it is extremely convenient to use.

The pressure water pipe was a major problem encountered by the builders. As an important component of the hydropower station used to create pressure head to drive the turbine to do work, it not only has to withstand the pressure of the water head but also withstand the water hammer pressure generated when the water flow in the pressure water pipe suddenly stops when closing the turbine guide vanes or gates. Therefore, the pressure water pipe must have high strength, otherwise it is easy to cause pipe bursting accidents.

In modern times, small and medium-sized hydropower stations generally use steel pipes or reinforced concrete pipes. They naturally didn't have large-diameter steel pipes. The manufacture of reinforced concrete pipes was not a problem, but the consumption of steel and cement was too large. At present, there was no ability to produce cement and steel bars themselves, and there were too many places where they would be used immediately. So someone suggested using ceramic pipes, but the tensile strength of ceramic pipes is poor, and they will burst under 10 meters of water pressure, so they can only be used on small head power stations. Moreover, no one has made such large ceramic pieces. I'm afraid no one in local Lingao knows how to fire them—besides, the transmigrators haven't found a pottery kiln yet—not even a brick kiln has been found.

Wang Luobin considered again and again and proposed using wooden pipes. This kind of wooden pipe is spliced from wooden planks 4-6 cm thick and tightened with iron hoops. Its strength is better than concrete pipes and can be used at a head height of less than 100 meters. In comparison, concrete pipes can only be used for heads below 50 meters. If the wooden pipe is well maintained, its lifespan is not inferior, and there is no problem using it for 10-20 years.

The problem of wood was relatively easy to solve. The work of logging had not stopped for a day these days. Although lacking drying equipment, Wu Kuangming also built an earth kiln to dry wood by slow smoking with branches and leaves. This method has low efficiency and inconsistent drying degree, but at least it can provide enough usable wood.

The problem is that splicing pipes with wooden planks is not easy. It is a bit like coopering, a craft that is about to be lost, let alone manufacturing such large-diameter wooden pipes. After several unsuccessful attempts, finally someone used CAD modeling to decompose the standard size of each splicing material. The Timber Team looked at the processing drawings where each material was precise to the millimeter and had detailed angles, not knowing whether to laugh or cry—I don't have a CNC sawing machine here.

But with numbers, exploration had a direction. Based on the data in the drawings, and after a few days of exploration, the first pipe was finally spliced, 4 meters long, 0.7 meters in diameter, tightened with iron hoops on the outside. After a simple water addition test, it was found that the splicing strength was not enough. When manufacturing the second pipe, the thickness of iron hoops and wood was increased. After the test was qualified, the sawmill immediately produced 32 meters of pressure wooden pipes, of which 12 meters were for backup. Facts proved that this backup was necessary; 2 were scrapped during the construction phase. The interfaces between pipes were connected and sealed with cement mortar. The piers and anchor blocks between pressure pipes were built with cement mortar and stone masonry.

The bottom of the pressure pipe is the powerhouse. Its base requirements are relatively high, so crushed stone mortar concrete was used regardless of cost. Part of it used stone strips of various sizes from the quarry with unknown purposes.

Although Mei Wan and his architectural engineering team had not built a hydropower station before, the power station equipment designed for rural areas had detailed and easy-to-understand instructions. A group of people with engineering experience studied carefully, plus their respective memories of hydropower stations they had witnessed, it was not difficult to understand the specific construction methods. Excavating earthwork, ditches, building powerhouses, and even erecting electric poles were all familiar tasks. The water channel was an earthen channel, while other buildings were built with cement mortar and stone masonry.

Excavation was relatively laborious in certain rocky sections, but with tools like air compressors and pneumatic picks, it was relatively easily overcome. Originally, the Executive Committee also allocated some ammonium nitrate and kerosene, preparing to use explosives for construction when necessary, but Mei Wan considered it better to use this kind of big killer less—none of them had engineering experience using explosives.

Because Wang Luobin had lived and worked in the rural areas of Guangxi for many years, he knew this kind of rural small hydropower and other agricultural livelihood buildings well. Recently, he was responsible for coordinating the projects. When inspecting the construction site, he saw a group of people gathered together at the hydropower station from a distance, seeming to be arguing about something. He walked closer and saw that it was mainly personnel from the Architecture Team and the subordinate engineering team. One was the team leader Mei Wan, and the other he had some impression of, Zhuo Tianmin, who proposed building a simple road first during highway infrastructure construction.
