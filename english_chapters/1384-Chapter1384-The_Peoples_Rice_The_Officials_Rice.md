# Chapter 1384 - The People's Rice, The Official's Rice

Seeing things going badly, Shopkeeper Liu shouted loudly: "Brothers, grab your weapons, put up the door planks!" As he spoke, he had already grabbed a cudgel.

The clerks grabbed sticks together and beat desperately outward - they were both clerks and thugs, with rich fighting experience. Seeing they had encountered a huge crisis, everyone roused their spirits, beating sticks wildly outward to drive away the crowd.

The common people were even more furious. They seemed to have forgotten why they came here; the anger and sorrow of many days erupted like a mountain flood. Those beaten down crawled up, disregarding bloody heads from stick blows, rushing up desperately, grabbing sticks with their hands to fight the clerks. People who were already sallow and emaciated from hunger, dying, suddenly had unknown strength, knocking down several clerks in succession.

Once the clerks fell, they were immediately submerged in the crowd, punched and kicked, their screams quickly drowned out by the crowd's wild roars.

Seeing his clerks beaten down one by one, his subordinates retreating step by step, and more and more people gathering outside, Shopkeeper Liu was extremely panicked, knowing he had provoked public wrath today.

In the past, he would have long since run away to avoid immediate loss, but here was the family business he had built with great difficulty. just in the rice warehouse behind, there were seven or eight hundred shi of rice stored, plus over a thousand taels of silver and many valuables. If he ran, he would have nothing left!

He gritted his teeth, pulled out a Burmese sword from a hidden compartment under the counter, and shouted: "Brothers, show your blades! Charge together—"

Before his voice fell, several lime packets were suddenly thrown from the crowd. Shopkeeper Liu took a solid hit on the face. The shop hall was instantly filled with white lime dust. The clerks hit by lime could no longer care about "real weapons," howling while covering their faces, stumbling and running backward.

The rioting stream of people was like water breaking a dike, instantly bursting through the rice shop's main gate. The crowd poured in like mercury spilling on the ground. Some chased and beat the fleeing clerks with sticks; some pushed over rice bins, using bags to fill rice. Bin after bin of white rice was pushed over, white rice flowing like water. People threw themselves into this white "rice river," grabbing to their hearts' content. Some brought cloth bags, others directly took off clothes to wrap rice. The inner circle grabbed rice, the outer circle desperately pushed inward. A strong young man directly shouldered a straw sack of one shi of rice and ran out.

Some among them didn't grab rice but took people directly to the backyard to intercept Shopkeeper Liu. Seeing several others directly smashed open the money chest, nimbly pouring the silver and copper coins from the chest into prepared gunny sacks. Those who approached wanting to take a share in the chaos were immediately beaten out.

Hao Yuan ignored the money chest and didn't want rice. He jumped onto the counter in three steps and two, shouting loudly: "Fellow villagers, everyone don't be chaotic, take one by one, don't waste it in vain! The rice here belongs to us common people!"

His voice was very loud and extremely resonant. Even in this chaotic environment, it instantly suppressed the noise inside the shop hall. The common people inside and outside the shop stopped their commotion for a moment, casting their gazes on this person.

"There is plenty of rice here, and even more in the rice warehouse behind! Don't waste the rice! There are still many poor people outside with no food to eat. after everyone takes rice, go out and tell people nearby to come take it! This is all the blood and sweat of us common people!"

A burst of applause immediately rang out below. Hao Yuan jumped off the counter and hurried to the back. In the courtyard, seven or eight rice shop clerks lay in disorder; some were still groaning, some were already stiff and motionless.

Shopkeeper Liu, face full of white lime, was pressed down under the eaves, emitting unwilling roars. His face had been beaten bloody. His hands and body were covered in blood.

"Did he speak?"

"Confessed." One of the young men smiled contemptuously. "Shopkeeper Liu even called himself a tough nut who wasn't afraid of beating or killing, yet he told everything before we finished cutting five fingers."

As he spoke, several people had already carried out several small chests from the back room. Heavy as they were, needless to say, they were all wealth.

"Send Shopkeeper Liu on his way." Hao Yuan ordered, "Don't draw blood!"

Just as his voice fell, a strong man standing behind Shopkeeper Liu swung a stick and struck heavily on the back of his head. Shopkeeper Liu went limp with blood flowing from mouth and nose without even letting out a scream.

"Ignore the rice in the shop. Now everyone occupy the rice warehouse door, no one is allowed to take rice casually. Line up and distribute rice by head count! Regardless of adults or children, give one dou to everyone who comes!" Hao Yuan ordered.

Outside, common people who got the news swarmed in. Although there were seven or eight "runners" serving as "idlers" in the yamen in town, they were good at bullying common people on ordinary days but useless when really facing a mob. Seeing a "civil uprising" breaking out, let alone coming out to maintain order, they didn't even dare show their faces. Only a few people ran all the way to Lin'an County to report to the authorities.

Hearing the news, common people from the town and neighboring villages came one after another with baskets and rice bags. Hao Yuan led people to distribute rice by head count in front of the rice warehouse. In less than half a day, the rice in the rice shop was distributed empty.

Receiving the news, the Magistrate of Lin'an County hastily sent the Jail Warden with horse and foot fast catchers to suppress it, but unexpectedly they found on the way that the bridge had been burned. They had to take a detour. By the time they arrived, the entire rice shop had been smashed and looted empty. Except for catching a few unlucky guys wandering in the empty shop hall hoping to find something more, nothing was left - even winnowing baskets, baskets, reed mats, and even door planks were gone, all looted empty.

Grabbing rice was like "eating from rich households," not rare in frequent famine years. Only this time several people had died. Lin'an County didn't dare neglect and hurriedly reported the situation.

However, the rice riots spread like a plague throughout the entire Northern Zhejiang region.

At this time in the several prefectures of Northern Zhejiang, the people's dissatisfaction was already like dry firewood soaked in oil. The rice grabbing action in Dongguan Town undoubtedly amounted to lighting a fire on top. In the following ten-plus days, common people in counties under the three prefectures of Hangzhou, Huzhou, and Jiaxing in Northern Zhejiang, and places like Wujiang in Suzhou Prefecture of Southern Zhili rioted successively, destroying or looting over two hundred rice shops. The entire Jiangnan region was shaken.

The Merchants Bureau ships transporting grain to Liaodong had already set sail in late July: Wu Zhixiang had transported 30,000 shi of rice as promised. This made Zhao Yingong look at him with new eyes. On this day, he specially hosted a banquet for him at the Shanghai headquarters, nominally to settle accounts with him, but actually to further probe his intention for cooperation.

The wine and dishes were naturally all Wu Zhixiang's favorite "Australian style" and Guangdong flavors, including the famous Wuzhou dish "Paper-Wrapped Chicken" - of course, paper-wrapped chicken didn't exist in Wuzhou yet at this time. This greatly whetted the appetite of Young Master Wu who had lingered in Jiangnan for more than half a year.

When half drunk, Zhao Yingong asked him how to settle the payment. Should he write one ticket for him, or split it into several tickets.

"I have a list here." Wu Zhixiang took out a piece of paper from his bosom, on which were written many "Hall Names" of So-and-So Hall. Under each "Hall Name" were different numbers written in Suzhou numerals. Some as small as three hundred, others as large as ten thousand.

Zhao Yingong knew this must be the list of Ministry of Revenue officials participating in this resale of tribute grain. A rough look showed about twenty people. Those with much silver were likely high officials of the Ministry of Revenue; those with less were at least officials like Warehouse Ambassadors in Qingjiangpu.

"Good. write as Delong tickets or..."

"Write all as Delong tickets. Delong tickets are exquisite and good-looking - much better than the rotten paper of Shanxi houses." Wu Zhixiang was very happy having accomplished a "big matter." "Also prepare another thousand taels of cash silver."

"Good." Zhao Yingong immediately summoned a secretary specializing in handling money and finance to issue tickets one by one according to the list. Then he ordered someone to bring a thousand taels of silver in a chest.

With all tickets issued, plus cash silver, it was only 50,000 taels. Zhao Yingong was somewhat puzzled and asked:

"What about the remaining silver? Should I prepare cash silver or..."

"The remaining silver counts as my capital." Wu Zhixiang smiled. "Count me in for a share of the Merchants Bureau."

Zhao Yingong nodded: "Easy to say! But your esteemed father..."

"It doesn't matter." Wu Zhixiang shook his head. "I can make the decision on this matter." He said jokingly: "I can't invest in the Purple character shares now, so letting me buy a share in the Merchants Bureau should be proper, right?"

Zhao Yingong laughed dryly a few times, not taking up the conversation. Although he knew his identity wouldn't be a secret to someone like Wu Zhixiang who dealt with Guangzhou Station for a long time, saying it to his face like this was inevitably too rash.

However, the other party wanting to invest could be accepted - right now the Merchants Bureau was tight on money. Paying 10,000 taels less was a good thing. He immediately expressed willingness to accept the investment.

Wu Zhixiang was in a great mood. He drank a few more cups, and his speech inevitably became less cautious. He smiled and said:

"Speaking of which, Brother Zhao being able to raise so much grain this time also owes thanks to a certain grandee."

Zhao Yingong's heart moved, knowing that these drunken words likely contained some important information. Thus he didn't say much, just silently drinking wine with a smile.

Sure enough, Wu Zhixiang rambled on incoherently revealing many things. It turned out this batch of grain was purchased and sold so smoothly not only because Ministry of Revenue and Canal Transport officials were sharing the profit, but even the Nanjing Provincial Administration Commission yamen was involved - the fact that the Merchants Bureau was trying to buy rice was specifically revealed to them by people in the Nanjing Provincial Administration Commission yamen.

"Otherwise, younger brother isn't Zhuge Liang; how could I foresee with divine accuracy that you, older brother, wanted to buy such a large amount of rice?"

Zhao Yingong was secretly alarmed: This was simply the rhythm of eating the plaintiff then eating the defendant! On one hand choking off supply refusing to give rice and insisting on cash equivalent, on the other hand letting people come forward to contact for selling black market rice at high prices... The methods these officials used to amass wealth were truly ruthless!

Needless to say, probably a considerable part of the rice Wu Zhixiang transported came from the Nanjing provincial treasury - the grain and pay that should originally have been allocated to Guan-Ning.
