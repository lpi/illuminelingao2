# Chapter 42: An Unexpected Visitor

One year later.

Southern China, a certain major city.

Guo Yi walked into his office. He was a civil servant of the People's Republic—though today he was a bit late, having drunk a few too many glasses at dinner with old classmates the night before.

When old classmates met, drinking was inevitable. But those who drank too much usually weren't doing so out of happiness.

Those who'd done well naturally bragged to the heavens, wanting everyone to know how successful they were. Those who hadn't done well simply didn't show up.

For someone like him, stuck in the middle, the mood was actually the most depressing...

Those doing well looked down on them, mocking them for coasting along on easy rice without ambition. Those doing poorly assumed they just drank tea all day...

On his desk sat some materials—the latest reports on social trends. Guo Yi worked in a department dedicated to maintaining social stability, unity, harmony, and tranquility.

After routinely reviewing several unremarkable reports, he came to one marked with a "Pending" tag—a status report from a coastal city in Guangdong. Over the past year, a strange group of people had been gathering at an idle maritime militia training base there. Every day they conducted military drills—marching, running, other physical training activities. At night they held meetings that ran late, apparently with chanting of slogans. Someone suspected it was a pyramid scheme and reported it to the Commerce Bureau. The enforcement squad checked once but found no signs of pyramid sales. The local police station had also visited without finding any violations. The person in charge explained it was pre-employment training for a company. They checked the business license—indeed such a company existed, registered over a year ago. The militia base was rented from the local People's Armed Forces Department.

Still, the situation seemed suspicious. So the report wound its way to Guo Yi's supervisor's desk. The supervisor's instruction: "If you have time," he said, "go check it out. See if there are any problems."

Whether intelligence work or stability work, sitting in an office reviewing documents was always the main job.

One person mentioned in the materials was named Wen Desi. According to registration documents, he was the company's legal representative, chairman, and general manager.

Guo Yi hadn't seen this person's file before. To be fair, this Director Wen wasn't the type to be on their radar. But within the bureau, Guo Yi was known for his love of digging through materials and archives. This hobby had offended people—he himself didn't know whose toes he'd stepped on with the information he'd dug up—so after several rounds of promotions in his department, he remained a mere staff member. And all work that could earn credit was kept far from him.

He pulled up Wen Desi's file. An ordinary, unremarkable person in his thirties, formerly an engineer and manager at several companies, with decent income. He enjoyed traveling and had strong interests in history and military affairs. Did some handicrafts. An outdoor sports and weapons enthusiast, also something called a "survivalist"—preparing to dig bunkers for nuclear winter. Presumably his home was stocked with provisions. But no evidence he possessed or attempted to possess weapons—not even dogs of any variety. He frequented certain websites, posting inquiries about which ammunition was cheaper, outdoor equipment, and so forth. Clean background, no bad records, not even traffic violations.

His company had been registered six months ago with one million yuan in capital. Guo Yi knew registered capital was usually empty, but based on Wen Desi's past income-tax payments, coming up with one million wasn't difficult. Checking his bank records: six months ago he'd emptied his savings in several withdrawals—over 800,000 yuan. Since then, his personal account hadn't held such large fixed deposits.

The company account transactions also appeared normal—regular business operations, buying and selling. Listed expenses included: wages, utilities, office costs. There was cash in the account but not much—hovering around 100,000.

Guo Yi also checked tax bureau records, confirming his thoughts. The company's business activities were conducted normally, all taxes and fees paid in full. Some minor accounting irregularities had been found, but no issues with tax evasion—though reasonable tax avoidance did exist.

Guo Yi pondered for a while. He saw no potential for mass incidents or other disharmonious elements. But since the boss had spoken, he might as well take a field trip—call it a vacation.

This county town was ordinary, like countless similar coastal towns in Guangdong—densely populated and economically prosperous. Prosperity brought a large floating population. Every day at the long-distance bus station plaza, people carrying bundles and dragging families came and went—chasing their dreams.

Among this surging crowd, for the past half year, nearly every day brought truly unexpected guests. They dressed variously, spoke in all dialects, furtively clutching maps and notes, in groups of three to five or alone, scanning the station plaza for something.

Xiao Zishan stood at the station exit, holding up a fruit box torn open, with crooked brush-written characters: "Crossing Trade." His once white and plump face had grown much thinner and darker. He wore a sweat-stained promotional T-shirt and a frayed straw hat.

A former foreign-enterprise white-collar worker—even if unemployed—appearing in such a getup at a coastal town... Xiao Zishan himself didn't know if he'd gone crazy or was living an absurd dream that had gone on far too long. And yet, he knew, more and more people were chasing the same dream.

Today, as usual, some would arrive. Xiao Zishan knew that some would hesitate and shrink back as before, while others wouldn't be selected. The road to dreams would be winding.

Guo Yi emerged from the exit. The September weather was still somewhat stifling, the sun scorching. This was his first time in this small city. He scanned the crowd at the exit. His gaze immediately caught the torn cardboard box.

"Crossing Trade"

Wasn't this the company Wen Desi had started? In that instant, Xiao Zishan's gaze briefly met his. That flash of a moment might be called "a fated encounter"—but neither experienced a sudden shiver or radiated an irresistible king's charisma to make the other submit. Guo Yi was interested in the company; Xiao Zishan sensed this person was no ordinary visitor.

Years in sales hadn't developed Xiao Zishan in many areas, but he'd learned to read people. This person had sharp, alert eyes; his movements displayed calm confidence; his clothes were low-key yet neat; he carried little luggage. This was someone who ate the government's rice—nine chances out of ten, from some authority department. And this person was watching him—not interested in him as a dark-skinned fat man, but in the box he was holding.

Before his next thought could form, a tall, plump young man laden with bags approached:

"Crossing Company?"

"That's us. And you are?"

"I'm here to cross over..."

Xiao Zishan broke into a cold sweat: *Buddy, you really have to say that out loud in public?* "Um... that... where did the PLA sweep?"

Everyone who came had to exchange the code phrase. This absurd rule came from who knows where—we're not some comedy troupe... probably someone's gangster-novel obsession.

"Asia! Asia!" The young man, apparently still excited, spoke loudly. "I'm Meng Xian! Meng Xian!"

"I know, I know..." Xiao Zishan's head was sweating. He was a low-key person; with a thief's guilty conscience, he lowered his voice. "Go to the parking lot. There's a minibus, plate number ******."

"Where's Director Wen..."

"You'll see him soon... I still have to pick up a few more people..." Xiao Zishan looked around nervously, hoping their exchange hadn't attracted attention.

The bustling crowd around them was busy with their own affairs; no one noticed them. Xiao Zishan's heart steadied slightly. That person from before had disappeared. Somehow, he felt a vague unease—should he report this to the Executive Committee when he returned?

That day, Guo Yi observed them from a corner for quite a while. Though he couldn't hear what they said, he could roughly tell the man with the fruit box was picking someone up. One person was excited; the other seemed uneasy, vigilant—indicating the conversation contained some secret. From the picker's familiarity with the surroundings and the box's wear, such pickups had been going on for quite a while. He tailed the enthusiastic Meng Xian to the parking lot and noted the minibus's plate number.

The minibus didn't leave immediately—meaning more people were expected. But Guo Yi decided not to wait around. First, he went to the telecom and mobile companies, pulling the company's call records. Contrary to his expectations, the company's phone traffic was quite heavy—almost daily, large numbers of calls coming and going.

With help from local authorities, most landline numbers were quickly traced: the majority belonged to domestic small and medium enterprises, research institutes, design academies, plus various trading and consulting companies. All kinds of businesses.

Mobile numbers were trickier—phone registrations were looser, many owners untraceable, and the geographic spread too wide. Guo Yi started investigating from the landline end.

What he found left him extremely puzzled.

This company was frequently contacting enterprises, research institutes, and design academies across the country. They'd also purchased considerable equipment and materials—nothing special for a company. But the range of industries involved was absurdly broad and strange. Ordering generators, small hydropower equipment, transformer facilities—understandable. But also multiple wind-power systems plus large quantities of spare parts. The company also showed great enthusiasm for various blueprints and technical documents—even interested in condom and sanitary-napkin manufacturing technology.

"Does he have that much money?" Guo Yi couldn't help questioning the motive. Money laundering surfaced in his mind again. Or were they collecting technical intelligence? From enterprise feedback, they weren't interested in high-tech products. Quite the opposite—they were keen on simple, outdated, obsolete technologies and processes. Was there any industrial spy who worked this way?

Perhaps they were using all this as smoke to cover some major secret? If so, what were they trying to do?

That evening, Guo Yi lay exhausted on the hotel bed, declining the Nth phone call offering him a relaxation massage. His mind was a jumbled mess. He fell into a drowsy sleep.

In his dream, Guo Yi saw Wen Desi wearing a strange long robe. A huge ship. Riding the wind and waves. In the distance, a verdant island—blue sky, white clouds, azure sea, silver sand...
