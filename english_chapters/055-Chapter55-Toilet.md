# Chapter 55 - Toilet

Chapter 55 Toilet

Among all the infrastructure, there was one thing that was most valued by everyone, and that was the toilet.

"Eating and excreting are big matters of life." Shi Yishi, the Minister of Health, emphasized, "If the toilet problem is not solved well, infectious diseases will break out, and the consequences will be unimaginable."

"We don't want those dirty and smelly dry latrines. We want flushing toilets."

"But flushing toilets require a complex sewage system." Mei Lin said.

"Then build septic tanks." Shi Yishi suggested, "Build a three-chamber septic tank under each toilet. Ferment the excrement and urine to kill bacteria and parasite eggs, and then use it as fertilizer."

"This is feasible." Wu Nanhai of the Agricultural Group agreed, "Fertilizer is just what we lack."

So, a "Toilet Revolution" began.

They built public toilets according to modern standards. Tiled floors, white ceramic squatting pans, automatic flushing tanks...

"This toilet is cleaner than my home!" A Transmigrator exclaimed.

In order to keep it clean, they also formulated a strict "Toilet Management Regulation".

"Flush after use."
"No spitting everywhere."
"Wash hands frequently."

Anyone who violated the regulations would be punished by cleaning the toilet for a week.

Under such high-pressure policies, the toilets in the campsite always maintained a clean and hygienic state.

This became a highlight of the Transmigrators.

Later, when Ming Dynasty people visited here, they were all shocked by these "luxurious" toilets.

"The Australians' thatched huts (toilets) are cleaner than our kitchens!" They sighed with emotion.

Some people even regarded the toilet as a "scenic spot" and came to visit specifically.

Of course, this is a later story.

Now, the Transmigrators were enjoying the pleasure of comfortable excretion.

"Ah... comfortable!" A Transmigrator walked out of the toilet, showing a satisfied expression.

In this strange and difficult world, a clean toilet could bring great psychological comfort to people.
