# Chapter 313 - Sweet Port Crisis: Internal Strife

The next day, news of the fire at Zou Monk's Temple became a sensation. Many people went to watch the excitement at the ruins, which had already been burned into a pile of rubble. The fire had started so quickly and with such intensity that everyone said they had never seen anything like it—by the time the Hai'an Street Fire Brigade arrived under the protection of the local militia, the entire hall was already burning like a torch.

Those in the know said that the excessive amount of firewood and clear oil piled under the gable walls was the culprit. The punks gambled and drank by lamplight in the hall every day; it was likely carelessness with the lights that started the fire.

The destruction of Zhao Jijiao's gang did not elicit sympathy from anyone. Many were even happy that the street had one less gang of villains, saying it was retribution for their usual evil deeds.

However, anyone who had heard of the open strife and veiled struggles between Huanan and Master Zhu didn't think so. This sudden, bizarre fire, from which not a single person in the room escaped, was indeed food for thought. The few punks who were luckily not in the temple and escaped with their lives all fled the next day—their noses were sharper than anyone's.

The yamen runners detained the temple sexton and the fire-tender Taoist from the rear courtyard, but this didn't mean the county yamen considered the incident suspicious—it was purely routine extortion by the runners. Everyone in the temple insisted they heard no suspicious sounds. With some people's influence, the sexton's wife easily negotiated a price with the head of the "Fast Squad" in the teahouse opposite the yamen, and they were released.

After bustling through the streets for a few days, the incident slowly faded. Arson incidents targeting Huanan naturally ceased completely. The sugar merchants who had originally refused to attend meetings now secretly communicated with Huanan through Feng Guangfeng.

Originally, everyone was not enthusiastic about the new Huanan Sugar Industry Guild. Now their attitude took a 180-degree turn; the sugar merchants became active. Chang Shide found that "talking business" could now go deeper. Chen Tianxiong seized the time to actively lobby the sugar merchants in private.

Zhu An sat with an iron face in the Haiyi Guild's council hall, seated at the head as usual. The twenty chairs on the left and right sides of the hall were full, occupied by the head shopkeepers of various sugar firms sitting upright.

This was the first meeting of the Haiyi Guild called since Zhu An announced he was "ill." The topic was the rebuilding of Zou Monk's Temple. Third Master Zhu was now surrounded by enemies on all sides, everything falling apart: sugar refinery workers recruited, the Gu family pirates annihilated, sugar merchants betraying him, and Zhao Jijiao's gang inexplicably burned to death.

He thought he held a handful of good cards, but now he was left empty-handed. Third Master Zhu couldn't think of anything else to use against Huanan. Open spears and hidden arrows—he had used them all. Huanan stood tall; not only did it stand, but it also dug out his foundation.

Deep down, he knew he had failed, but Third Master Zhu was unwilling to accept defeat—he had dominated the Leizhou sugar market for thirty years and had long regarded his every word and deed as the embodiment of authority. When such authority was suddenly lost, he couldn't accept it emotionally.

This time, under the pretext of rebuilding Zou Monk's Temple, he convened a meeting of sugar merchants, attempting to use his accumulated prestige from over the years to make one last attempt to salvage the situation.

The sugar merchants turned out surprisingly complete; not one was missing. Even the "traitor" Feng Guangfeng came. Seeing this outsider, Zhu's eyes nearly spat fire. Although he clearly knew this man was just a go-between and that the ones betraying him were the fellow townsmen he regarded as most reliable, the bond of hometown sentiment made him unconsciously direct his anger at this outsider.

"He actually dares to come!" he muttered low.

The advisor standing aside glanced uneasily at the crowd in the hall. These people were either expressionless or at ease; none showed any guilt or unease.

"Master, stay calm."

Zhu An nodded, steadied himself, and spoke:

"Everyone knows that a few days ago, the Patriarch's temple caught fire. Although only the first courtyard was burned, the Haiyi Guild is naturally duty-bound to take up the rebuilding—"

He paused deliberately here, looking at everyone's expressions. Seeing no reaction, as if it had nothing to do with them, his heart went cold:

"...I wonder what everyone thinks about this temple rebuilding?"

"The temple naturally must be rebuilt," someone interrupted. "But this is not an urgent matter."

Hearing someone differ on the spot, Zhu An was furious. Looking closely, it was Wu Yi, the owner of "Baolai Firm," one of the lowest-ranking small sugar firms. This man had begged grandfathers and grandmothers and offered ten thousand taels of silver to squeeze into the Haiyi Guild. Baolai Firm had small capital and carried little weight in the Haiyi Guild.

Zhu An suppressed the anger in his heart and said coldly, "Oh? Then in Shopkeeper Wu's opinion, what is the urgent matter?"

"Acquiring sugar!" Wu Yi poked relentlessly at Third Master Zhu's sore spot. "The sugar season is about to end. The warehouses of our firms are still empty. Without sugar, where will the silver come from to repair the temple? This matter, perhaps it is better for Third Master Zhu to bear it alone!"

"Bastard!" Zhu An roared. When had he ever been mocked to his face by such a minor character? "What thing are you! Didn't you kneel on the ground begging people just to get the qualification to buy sugar?"

"Indeed, I am not some big shot!" Wu Yi was very bold. "You, Third Master Zhu, are a big shot. Originally, you vowed solemnly: this sugar season would guarantee everyone gets sugar. Now? I, Wu Yi, beg grandfathers and grandmothers to acquire sugar and make money, not to lick your stinky feet, Third Master Zhu!"

These words were extremely naked, but they also vividly expressed the mindset of the majority here—Third Master Zhu was useless!

"Old Wu, don't put it that way—" The fatty from "Riyuelai" came out to smooth things over, but couldn't think of anything to say for a moment.

"If I don't say it this way, how should I say it?" Wu Yi had long been secretly bought over by Chang Shide. He bowed in a circle to everyone around. "Shopkeepers, Owners! Didn't we form the Haiyi Guild to unite in acquiring sugar? Now that the Haiyi Guild has been tossed by Zhu An to the point of getting no sugar, I propose that Third Master Zhu can no longer be this Guild Master!"

Zhu An kept a cold face, appearing very calm on the surface—almost indifferent. In fact, this was a practiced skill of feigning calmness; he was very nervous inside. Wu Yi definitely didn't come up with singing this tune himself; there must be someone backing him, and probably most people here tacitly approved of his actions—thinking of this, Zhu An couldn't help but be alarmed.

What was more terrifying was that the surrounding people showed no surprise at all, proving his guess. Veins popped on Zhu An's face; he glared at this guy who turned hostile so quickly, wishing he could kick him to death.

"There is no need for the Haiyi Guild to exist anymore." Wu Yi surprisingly continued to fire away unceremoniously. "This sugar guild has long since become the private property of the Zhu family. Third Master Zhu! In the seventh year of Tianqi, the Haiyi Guild had nearly ten thousand taels of accumulated silver in the public account. Why was there only a few hundred taels left by the second year of Chongzhen, requiring assessments from everyone? For these two years, we paid the dues in full, not a tael less!"

People began to stir. Zhu An controlling the Haiyi Guild, placing his own people, spending public funds at will, and even collecting extra fees under various pretexts was never a secret. It was just that due to his prestige and ability, no one dared to bring it up. Now that someone mentioned it, everyone was whispering. Those who originally felt bad about saving face now felt Zhu An hadn't handled things beautifully and started muttering.

Feng Guangfeng stood up: "Shopkeeper Wu is absolutely right! There is no need for the Haiyi Guild to exist any longer."

The sugar merchants, originally just stirring, now became noisy. A moment later, someone sighed: "It has to be this way."

"Yes, there's no other way."

"Third Master Zhu has been busy for half a lifetime; he should rest."

"But if the Haiyi Guild is gone, what will we do in the future?" Someone was already discussing the aftermath, seeming to take the dissolution of the Haiyi Guild as a foregone conclusion, completely casting Third Master Zhu aside.

Zhu An suddenly stood up and shouted: "You despicable, shameless villains!" His voice was so loud it instantly drowned out all others. "Short-sighted, every one of you! The Haiyi Guild is where you settle down and make a living; you are destroying your own foundation!" He roared, "Without my Haiyi Guild—"

"The Haiyi Guild isn't named Zhu!" Feng Guangfeng loudly interrupted him. "For years, the Haiyi Guild has long been your Zhu family's, not everyone's!" He continued loudly: "I propose we invite Manager Wen of Huanan to preside over the big picture of the Haiyi Guild!"

Wu Yi immediately jumped out: "The current situation can only be resolved by Manager Wen."

Then, some others chimed in. Although some didn't join in, they remained silent and didn't oppose.

"This is the Haiyi Guild!" Zhu An screamed out of control. "I am the Guild Master!"

Wu Yi ignored him completely: "Please enter, Manager Wen!" he shouted.

Wen Tong and the others, guarded by Zhou Shizhai, had long booked a private room in a teahouse on the street, waiting. Several people hummed tunes and drank tea. Wen Tong couldn't help asking Chen Tianxiong:

"Is this plan of yours going to work? I'm afraid they won't understand what I say."

"Definitely work." Chen Tianxiong said with a smile, "Most of them are from Guangdong; you just need to speak Cantonese."

"I just feel it's a bit too dramatic." Wen Tong muttered. "Can't we take over in a different way?"

"Of course we can." Chen Tianxiong said. "But if you want to command the Sugar Industry Guild in the future, you must build momentum first. A little drama has good effects."

"Like this—"

Chen Tianxiong knew he lacked confidence: "Don't worry! Zhou Shizhai and Li Biao will guard you closely. Chen Sigen and his team will go in with you. Outside, there are Beiwei's men; he even took sniper rifles up to the roof..."

"No need, just let Zhou Shizhai go in with me." Wen Tong suddenly felt a surge of heroism. "I'm one of the protagonists anyway; I have a halo protecting me."

"Right, turn up your 'Tyrant's Aura' a bit more; the Haiyi Guild will submit immediately."

Wen Tong nodded repeatedly and closed his eyes to rest, probably trying to accumulate more 'Tyrant's Aura'.

Chen Tianxiong smiled, took out his walkie-talkie, and contacted Beiwei on the roof again. He was observing the movement in the Haiyi Guild courtyard, guarding against any sudden moves by Third Master Zhu.

Reports from everywhere indicated no movement. After a while, the person looking out the window reported that a servant came out of the Haiyi Guild gate and headed straight for the teahouse.

"The invitation is here. Old Wen, prepare yourself, time to go!"

Wen Tong nodded. He only took Zhou Shizhai and Li Biao, walking lightly from the street. Although it was only fifty meters of street, Wen Tong felt like he was walking on clouds. Fear, anticipation, doubt, and confidence mixed together; a drunk-like pleasure enveloped his body and mind.

The main gate of the Haiyi Guild was wide open. Walking up the steps, one could see straight into the hall with all windows open. Wen Tong took a deep breath and walked in with his head held high.

Feng Guangfeng was already waiting under the eaves, bowing with clasped hands. "Manager Wen, everyone has been waiting for a long time."

Liu Yulin, owner of Risheng Firm, was the first to stand up and bow. Then all the shopkeepers of the sugar firms stood straight and bowed. Wen Tong smiled all the way, returning bows.

"Shopkeepers, this is Manager Wen of Huanan Sugar Firm, also the Guild Master of the new Sugar Industry Guild." Wu Yi said loudly.

Wen Tong completely ignored Zhu An, whose face was full of flames and wished he could tear him apart. Standing in the center, he bowed in a circle:

"Shopkeepers and owners of the sugar firms, Huanan is honored by your kindness to be moved to become the Guild Master of the Sugar Industry Guild. Huanan will regard this as an honor and a responsibility, daring to accept the command, only to give my all for the sugar industry of Leizhou until my dying day..." He glanced at Zhu An, suddenly feeling this man wasn't scary at all, even pitiful—he still didn't know what he was facing. If he knew, he wouldn't be this angry. "...Zhu An betrayed everyone's trust, controlled the Haiyi Guild for many years, abused power, appointed cronies, embezzled public funds, colluded with pirates, and seduced bandits..." He listed twenty crimes in one breath, each well-founded, mobilizing the emotions of the crowd who had dissented against Zhu An's actions for years, giving a sense of great satisfaction.

"You, you—" Zhu An was so angry he couldn't speak. Indeed, these things were all true, but colluding with pirates and keeping bandits were for the survival of the entire Leizhou sugar industry—expedient measures weighing the lesser of two evils. Moreover, everyone reaped the benefits—for nearly twenty years, the sugar firms in Leizhou enjoyed peace; wasn't it the result of these expedient measures? Now they all became his crimes!

If you want to condemn someone, you can always find a charge! Third Master Zhu's hands and feet went cold—the opponent not only had plenty of money and "force," but was also first-class in "Thick Black Theory"!

Wen Tong spoke excitedly, "...I ask Third Master Zhu to step back from the torrential current bravely! Leave some room for us to see each other in the future, lest checking the accounts makes you a laughing stock!"
