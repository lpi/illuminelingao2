# Chapter 364 - The Foshan Journey (Part 13)

Watching Saoye withdraw, Li Luoyou calculated: he had a thousand *jin* of recently shipped Liaodong ginseng and several hundred *jin* of deer antler stored in Dengzhou—worth over ten thousand taels of silver. With Yangrunkai Hall's capabilities, purchasing the entire lot would be no problem. But with such a large quantity of ginseng suddenly appearing on the Foshan market, he worried it might attract unwanted attention.

Then he remembered something. From his waist he pulled out a set of keys and unlocked one of the cabinet doors. Inside he found a "ledger"—a "connections ledger" detailing all the public and private figures in Foshan Town who needed cultivation. It included family members, addresses, personal preferences, and even death anniversaries of deceased elders. He turned to "Lin Ming." Madam Lin's birthday was in just three days.

"Just in time." Li Luoyou nodded. The gift had to be both valuable and pleasing to Madam Lin.

He opened a large cabinet with a hidden lock. Inside were boxes of every type containing valuable gifts for cultivating important connections. He selected: a goose-egg mirror from Zizhen Studio; a box of twelve glass-bottled distilled floral waters; a box of silver-mounted lipstick tubes; and finally a box of genuine "Eastern Pearls" from Liaodong.

For Centurion Lin: a two-hundred-tael sight draft from Delong Bank, payable on demand. Li Luoyou knew this was simply a bill of exchange—he'd seen them in Macao. Yet Delong had actually established such a system in this region, inseparable from support by Zizhen Studio's Grand Shopkeeper Guo and Guangzhou's Gao family.

After dinner, Li Luoyou invited the two foreigners to his study.

"Come, let's have a small drink and chat." He produced wine from Europe. The three toasted and got down to business.

He had brought the two foreigners to Foshan for two purposes. First, to see if Foshan could become a foothold for missionary work. Li Luoyou was a Catholic, educated by Jesuits in Macao since childhood. As one of the Great Ming's few Catholics, spreading the Gospel was his duty—though the Jesuits also played a crucial role in his business.

Secondly, he planned to establish a foundry manufacturing Western cannons. After the Ningjin victory, the court's interest in Western firearms had surged. The court had ordered Guangdong officials to commission Portuguese cannon purchases. Li Luoyou saw tremendous opportunity—and harbored patriotic aspirations to modernize military weapons.

"The proposal to establish a foundry—I certainly support it," said Ma Yangchun, wearing Ming clothing. "The Superior instructed me: firearms are what the Great Ming cares about most. Satisfying the Emperor will help our Gospel-spreading."

"Father is correct." Li Luoyou said. "That's how Father Lu and Father Tang entered the capital."
