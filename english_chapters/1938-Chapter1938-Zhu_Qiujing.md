# Chapter 1938 - Zhu Qiujing

This shift leader was twenty years old this year, but she was a "widow."

Zhu Qiujing was from the outskirts of Guangzhou. She married at fifteen, becoming Madame He-Zhu. She became a mother at sixteen, and at seventeen, first her son died, followed by her husband. She became a "widow."

Her kind of resume was not too rare among women in this timeline.

Zhu Qiujing had lost her husband, and both her in-laws and her own family were plotting her remarriage. Widowhood was actually not very common among the common people—establishing a moral exemplar required a substantial economic foundation, otherwise life was unsustainable, especially since her husband had left her no children. From the perspective of both her natal family and her in-laws, a woman in her prime was obviously a good asset, and not liquidating it would be a waste.

Her in-laws and natal family fought fiercely over her ownership. In the end, Zhu Qiujing's father—an old scholar who had studied all his life without passing the exams—relied on the power of his "classmates" from his studying days to forcefully snatch back his daughter's ownership. He then turned around and married her off to a second husband.

Although Zhu Qiujing didn't necessarily have much affection for her first husband, she was absolutely unwilling regarding the new husband. Because this man was a famous bachelor in the neighboring village, who engaged in eating, drinking, whoring, and gambling, doing all sorts of evil. The benefit was that he had quite a bit of money on hand, owned quite a few fields at home, and had no parents-in-law above him.

However, she had no say in this matter—speaking up would only earn her a severe beating—even her mother dared not say "no." Zhu Qiujing's father coveted the large betrothal gift, so he "sold" the daughter he had snatched back. Thus, Zhu Qiujing went from being Madame He-Zhu to Madame Wang-Zhu.

The days that followed gradually evolved into a nightmare for Madame Wang-Zhu. A husband who wasn't home for days on end, creditors constantly coming to the door to take away everything, plus various thieves running rampant in the countryside and increasingly harsh taxes and various surcharges, she could only live a life of hiding here and there.

Finally, one day, when she discovered that she herself had become an object the creditors were about to come and claim, this girl who had always been honest and dutiful made the biggest decision of her life: she packed up the little money and food left in the house and fled to Guangzhou City with her mother, who was already a widow.

Guangzhou City was naturally not a paradise for the old and the young. Her mother fell ill within two days. The desperate reality of running out of money, the various risks of women being outside, and the temptation of the legendary divine medicine added together finally pushed the desperate Madame Wang-Zhu to the door of the Cihui Hall. From then on, this dark-skinned, short-statured girl entered a brand-new world.

Benefiting from her father's teaching back then, Madame Wang-Zhu passed the Type B diploma shortly after passing the purification, becoming one of the very few cultured individuals among naturalized women. After political review, she embarked on the path of "serving the Senate and the people" and was allocated to the Planning Agency's Data and Computing Center.

It is said that people are most likely to find faith when facing drastic environmental changes. This saying certainly applied to Madame Wang-Zhu. For her and many naturalized citizens, the Senate had become their god. The Senate opened a door, a door to a world she had never even imagined in her dreams. In this new world, she was no longer just a Madame Wang-Zhu who didn't even have a name, no longer needed to silently endure fate; she could become an independent person who fed and clothed herself through her own efforts.

In a lecture organized by the Senate for newly employed female naturalized citizens, the story of the Austral-Song heroine Qiu Jin told by a short-haired female Senator had a great impact on her. Although she only half-understood the new language spoken by the female Senator at that time, she grasped the general idea of the story. A woman who had married, just like her, could abandon her family and children and even shed her blood and sacrifice her head to resist the tyranny of the Eight-Foot Traitorous Minister. Such seemingly treacherous behavior became the "Woman Knight of Mirror Lake" praised by everyone in the Austral-Song. To commemorate this sage who gave her a completely new philosophy of life, she changed her name to Qiujing.

As one of the earliest qualified employees of the Data Center, after several years of hard work, she not only became a team leader managing a dozen girls but was also allocated a small one-bedroom apartment to settle herself and her mother as a technical backbone. Although this house was very small and came with a mortgage that took ten years to repay, for her, this was her own paradise. It had bright glass windows, a convenient coal briquette stove, clean corridors and rooms, and Ikea-style furniture influenced by the Senators' living habits. Although her old mother still nagged, hoping she would remarry soon, for the current Zhu Qiujing, marrying was no longer the core of life; she already had a life of her own.

Because she had been married and given birth, although not old in age, she was much more mature in her self-positioning. Zhu Qiujing never wore makeup and dressed simply—in fact, her looks and figure were both above average. Such deliberate simplicity and never participating in blind date events organized by "the organization" made everyone feel it was a pity. Some rumored that she was preserving her chastity for a man. Zhu Qiujing always scoffed at this claim.

She reported today's work situation of the input group to Xu Yicheng. The work of the input group was not difficult once familiar; the key was speed and error rate.
Input speed was easy to talk about; it was mainly a matter of proficiency, emphasizing hand-eye coordination. The error rate was much more critical—no matter how powerful the computer was, if the original data entered was wrong, the conclusions drawn would inevitably be problematic.

If it was just a simple numerical error, the problem wasn't too big, but if a decimal point was misplaced or a digit was written extra or missed, the final calculated conclusion would be miles off.

Human attention and energy are limited. Under poor conditions, inputting data inevitably leads to a higher error rate. To maximize assurance that inputters could work in a good state, the inputter's work was not only strictly limited to eight hours per shift, but they could also rest for fifteen minutes every two hours of work. The work meals were also specially supplied, with a balanced mix of fish, meat, and vegetables, containing more protein, vitamins, and trace elements. Therefore, being an inputter at the Computing Data Center was a very good job.

However, this was only material assurance. To ensure the input error rate remained at an acceptable level, constant supervision was required. Therefore, in the input group, "error checking" work had always been the focus. Not only was special "accuracy" education conducted all the time, but verification was also carried out. In addition to assigning dedicated personnel to verify each input task, scheduled and unscheduled spot check verifications were also adopted to assess the input error rate of each inputter.

"This is today's spot check verification situation." Zhu Qiujing handed him a report. "The error rate has dropped slightly compared to last time, but..."

Xu Yicheng knew there was other content behind this "but." The rest area was crowded and noisy, naturally inconvenient for saying much, so he beckoned her to the small lounge nearby.

"...There are a few people whose error rates remain high." From Zhu Qiujing's hesitant expression, Xu Laowu knew without being told that it was most likely the "Four Heavenly Kings" again.

These Four Heavenly Kings were four members famous throughout the Computing Center for high error rates. Their origins varied, but their common characteristic was that they all had countless ties with Senators. Some had sisters who were Senators' "Living Secretaries," and some had been "favored" by Senators themselves. Others had families with business dealings with the Senate's enterprises—they were important "partners."

Female inputters with similar backgrounds were not uncommon in the Computing Data Center, but their error rates and input speeds could at least reach a passing level. Whereas these four, whether in terms of error rate or input speed, had never reached a tolerable state.

Xu Laowu had already "opened the net on one side" for these Four Heavenly Kings, not eliminating them or changing their posts according to normal procedures, and organizing special training multiple times—it seemed the effect wasn't great.

He looked at today's spot check table. Sure enough, these four were occupying the top spots again. Looking at the monthly average error rate statistics beside it, their average error rate was 2.7 times that of ordinary inputters.

Inputting slowly and having a high error rate. No wonder Zhu Qiujing pulled a long face as soon as this matter was mentioned.

But Xu Laowu was somewhat in a dilemma. Because the Senators associated with these four included some who had greeted him and others with whom he had good relations. He felt somewhat unable to disregard these connections.

But letting this indulgence continue wasn't good either—if the hearts of the people scattered, the team would be hard to lead. Especially Zhu Qiujing; her serious and responsible attitude towards work made her particularly intolerant of such things. His "opening the net on one side" for the Four Heavenly Kings had actually caused a very bad influence within the Computing Data Center.

He considered for a moment and said:
"I'll first eliminate Fang Qi, who has the highest error rate. I hope this can give the others a bit of a shock. If there's still no improvement, I'll eliminate one every week starting next month."

Zhu Qiujing didn't say anything, just nodded. From her expression, she was obviously somewhat dissatisfied with Xu Laowu's handling plan. Zhu Qiujing was very serious about her work, treating the Senate's regulations as heavenly laws, and had always had opinions about this obvious favoritism. Moreover, she had talked to Xu Laowu about these matters many times.

Ever since she was selected by Du Wen to attend the Women Cadres Training Class, Xu Laowu found that her assertiveness had grown, and her expression in conversation had become much clearer, completely different from ordinary female employees who revered Senators as gods.

What Zhu Qiujing didn't know yet was that her name had appeared as a typical example in the "Instructions on Strengthening the Training of Women Cadres" just issued by Queen Du in the name of the Administration Council. This document, which partially plagiarized a report on women's work during the War of Liberation in the old timeline, pointed out: "We have the responsibility to cultivate a large number of outstanding women cadres to support the long-term war and various work in the rear. The methods for cultivating cadres should be based on different local conditions, adopting forms such as holding short-term training classes, participating in takeover work teams, and having the advanced constantly mentor apprentices to cultivate women cadres." As Queen Du's proud disciple, and being a Guangzhou native herself, she had already entered the Senate's line of sight.
