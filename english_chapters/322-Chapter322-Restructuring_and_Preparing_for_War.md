# Chapter 322 - Reorganizing the Army and Preparing for War

"According to Yu Eshu: a good Mongolian horse is worth one thousand strings of cash. An inferior one, eight hundred strings. A mule, five hundred strings." Wu De said with a smile, "You tell me. Just with these horses right now, how much is your pasture worth?"

"That much!" Whether it was Wu Nanhai, Yang Baogui, or Nick, hearing this market price gave them a fright.

"So—" Wu De said, "The matter of the pasture must wait at least until the bandit suppression operation is over. In addition, we are preparing to take over Dongchun Village. It won't be too late for you to build the pasture after everything is settled. At least it will be safer."

"Where is that place?" People like Nick had basically been moving back and forth between Bopu and Lingao since D-Day and were completely ignorant of these places.

"A small village at the foot of Piye Mountain." Wu De guessed they wouldn't know where Piye Mountain was either. "Piye Mountain is the main peak of Gaoshan Ridge, and also the route we must take to get to Damei Village. After taking it, it can serve as a stronghold to protect the traffic."

"When does the bandit suppression start?"

"That's a secret," Wu De smiled. "Actually, it can't be hidden from you, Nanhai. You'll know when preparing military rations. Now the mud-legs are still training. It will probably take another month or two."

Holding a thin rattan cane, Huang Xiong was shouting at his subordinates: "Left face! Right face! About face! You bunch of idiots!..." As he spoke, he kicked the buttocks of a recruit who turned in the wrong direction. The unlucky fellow immediately rolled in the mud, then quickly stood up with a face full of grievance, because no one understood what he said—Huang Xiong's Mandarin was extremely "Ming Dynasty characteristic," tantamount to a foreign language for the locals of Lingao.

There was no time to teach Mandarin anymore. Xi Yazhou simply adopted the method of "learning in training," letting recruits learn to accept Mandarin commands during training. Maybe they would learn more profoundly this way.

After the military parade of the Political Consultative Conference ended, the soldiers of the Teaching Battalion welcomed the rank conferment ceremony. According to their performance and ability level in the unit, most were conferred the rank of corporal, and a small number became sergeants. A few outstanding ones were selected to attend officer training. The original indigenous squad leaders were all promoted to officers this time. Huang Xiong became a second lieutenant in this promotion.

Those injured or disabled in previous battles received severance pay and retired. According to their remaining labor ability, they were assigned to work in different departments; those with mobility issues went to serve as gatekeepers in various departments and factories.

A very small number of soldiers from the Teaching Battalion were neither immediately promoted to sergeants nor attended officer training—they attended a short-term training class held by the General Bureau of Political Security in Bairen City. They underwent training and brainwashing for political security missions.

Those selected for training were all people politically dead-set on following the Transmigration Group. After training, they were still incorporated into the troops with the rank of sergeant. Each battalion had ten such sergeants, called the "Ten-Man Group," undertaking tasks such as consolidating the troops, preventing desertion and defection, and preventing spies from infiltrating the army. This system had already been secretly carried out during the Teaching Battalion era. The identities of these people were confidential; even Xi Yazhou didn't know which individuals were members of the "Ten-Man Group."

First sergeants, then they planned to gradually expand to ordinary soldiers. According to the plan of the General Bureau of Political Security: in the future, a "Ten-Man Group" system would be established in every company to ensure every squad had a "Political Soldier," forming an interlaced check-and-balance system with officers, sergeants, and Soldier Committees to strictly control the army.

Large numbers of recruits then began to build their own barracks under the command of the sergeants. They were assigned to these newly promoted sergeants according to the organization and began training. Based on the problems shown in various aspects during the first phase of the Teaching Battalion, the Military Committee revised the entire training syllabus and combat manual. Further highlighting formation, shooting, and earthwork training. Especially formation training, Lin Shenhe would preside over a specialized training on 19th-century infantry formation changes.

In addition to the original Infantry Teaching Battalion, the Army expected to organize another standard six-company infantry battalion.

A Special Forces Teaching Team was established: with one company each for communications, engineering, and logistics, plus an attached carrier pigeon team—compared to horses with big tempers, carrier pigeons bred much faster.

The Artillery Teaching Team added an Army Field Artillery Battery. At the suggestion of the Artillery Work Leading Group, the Army Field Artillery unified its equipment, equipping only three basic types of cannons: 12-pounder M1857 Napoeon cannons, M1841 12-pounder mountain howitzers, and M1841 24-pounder howitzers. Various miscellaneous cannons under the field artillery establishment were all melted down.

The General Staff carefully stationed troops in various controlled areas of the Transmigration Group for training. The scale in each place did not exceed one battalion. In Ma Qianzhu's view, in a place like Lingao, moving in basic units of infantry battalions was about enough. Lin Shenhe held the same view. In his proposed training and combat plan, he clearly stated: Infantry uses the battalion as the basic unit; cavalry, artillery, engineers, and logistics use the company as the basic unit. The regiment is only used as a combined unit.

The Navy's Marines also expanded by one company. Originally, the Admiralty intended to expand into a Marine Battalion, but naval ship sailors and fortress artillerymen took up most of the recruit quota assigned to the Navy. In addition, the Military Committee also clearly stated that the Navy did not need to expand land-based combat power for the time being, and should concentrate on building ship units.

After Huang Xiong became a second lieutenant, he was promoted to platoon leader. Although Huang Xiong did not understand the 20th-century military system, he easily understood that he had returned from the ranks of "soldiers" to the team of "officers." This lowest-level "Second Lieutenant" was probably like a *Qianzong* (Thousand-man Commander) or *Bazong* (Squad leader/Company Commander) in the Ming army.

However, the Australian officers were obviously not as nourished as the Ming officers—this didn't refer to wealth, but to throwing their weight around. Originally, becoming a *Qianzong* or *Bazong* was almost like being a local emperor; the soldiers under them were basically slaves of the officers. But here with the Australians, as sergeants and officers, they had the right to manage the soldiers under them strictly according to military regulations and discipline, but abusing soldiers without reason or demanding property from soldiers was absolutely not allowed here. Every company had a Soldier Committee, which frequently went down to the squads to preach soldiers' rights. Once a soldier "sued"—or using the new term, "complained"—the Soldier Committee would send someone to investigate secretly and report the results to the "Chiefs." The outcome goes without saying—Huang Xiong knew a sergeant who, upon gaining a promotion, demanded the recruits under him buy meat and wine to celebrate for him. After being discovered and reported by the Soldier Committee, he was immediately docked three months' pay and demoted to Private First Class.

Tian Liang also gained a promotion. His performance was average, so he was only promoted to corporal, serving as a squad leader for a recruit squad, leading nine recruit brothers in drills every day. His Mandarin wasn't standard, and he would blurt out hometown dialect when anxious. But being able to attach a cloth patch to his bare shoulders and sew on three yellow bars made Tian Liang very happy. He was no longer an ordinary big-headed soldier; he was a "sergeant" of some sort. His pay also increased. He had always wanted to find Guo Fu and let her see his current appearance. But the place she worked, Bairen General Hospital, couldn't be entered casually, and the unit's training tasks were particularly busy—besides training, two days a week had to be set aside for labor, with units allocated to work on various construction sites by company. Working, training, and cultural and political studies every night left everyone exhausted, with basically no time to think about other things.

Although every day was just training or working, rumors of going to war had already spread among the officers. The sensitive transmigrators already knew the next target from the change in propaganda climate—Bandit Suppression.

Starting a month ago, the training content of the troops changed, letting the troops conduct combat in small groups in the mountains, training mountain combat capabilities, and conducting subjects to strengthen long-distance precision shooting. Besides the change in training content, a more obvious sign was that in the fixed weekly political studies, victims of bandits found from all over the county began to appear. This group of old and young people cried and wailed on stage, lamenting the various terrible things done by bandits to the soldiers. Because most recruits were from Lingao locally, they had personally experienced the infringement of bandits. Under the clever guidance of the "Political Soldiers," quite a few recruits also jumped onto the stage to bitterly state the disasters of banditry, quickly stirring up the atmosphere.

Thus, unknown as to who started it, crooked "Petitions for Battle" and "Statements of Determination" began to appear voluminously on the blackboards of every company.

"Immediately publish a series of reports on the local bandit problem in the *Lingao Times*." Ding Ding received a call from the Propaganda Department in the editorial office.

"Okay," Ding Ding hurriedly picked up a pencil. "What is the focus of the report?"

"There are four points to note: First, clearly state that the local bandit problem is a historical factor and has nothing to do with the current magistrate; Second, imply the long-term nature of the bandit problem involves certain local gentry and petty officials; Third, focus on discussing the impact of banditry on local livelihood; Fourth, do not explicitly or implicitly state what attitude the Transmigration Group will take towards the bandits."

"Understood." Ding Ding thought for a moment and scribbled a few ideas in his notebook.

"But I don't have materials; I need to find interview subjects..."

"Go to the Intelligence Committee tomorrow to pick up materials. Go pick them up every Monday from now on." The voice on the phone instructed, "We will arrange the interviews and notify you by phone when the time comes."

"Got it." Ding Ding moved his pen like flying, writing non-stop.

"The clean proof before publication must be submitted to the Propaganda Department for review first. You must also attend then."

"I will come."

"Besides the newspapers kept for archives, arrange the distribution of this batch of newspapers well, ensuring most are distributed to the local people." The phone hung up.

"Is this preparation for bandit suppression!" Ding Ding muttered to himself. He dared not neglect and hurried to find someone to fetch Zhou Dongtian to discuss layout matters. As for compiling articles, naturally, he had to ask Du Wen to step out—she had a unique ability to combine and fabricate using historical materials and data.

He Ming, dressed in a neat Year One Type Gray Army Uniform, walked into the Combat Conference Room of the General Staff with steps of 80 centimeters. everyone in the conference room stood up with a "swish" and saluted.

He Ming returned a salute. Although only in his early fifties, his hair was somewhat gray and cut very short. He looked very spirited.

He didn't make any polite remarks: "Comrades, we are now convening the first Bandit Suppression Work Meeting." After speaking, he pulled open the map curtain behind him with a "swish," revealing a large-scale map of the Lingao situation covered with aerasable transparent sheet. Many marks had already been smeared with red and blue pens.

"Now, please ask the Intelligence Committee to report on the bandit situation in Lingao."

Luo Duo stood up and opened a thick folder in his hand.

"Comrades, the booklet in front of you is a comprehensive investigation report on the bandit situation in Lingao by our Social Work Department."

Immediately, a rustling of flipping through booklets sounded below.

"...According to comprehensive news from our various departments, the bandit situation in Lingao is as follows—"

Banditry in Lingao was very serious. The control of ancient social governments over local areas was very weak. Slightly remote places often had bandit activities. Even in the so-called prosperous Kangxi and Qianlong reigns, there were large bandit strongholds in the Miaofeng Mountain area only about a hundred *li* from the capital. Lingao was located on the frontier, sparsely populated for a long time. Whether it was the government or local gentry, the power to maintain social order was very limited. This made bandit activities unusually rampant.

Luo Duo said: "According to our investigation: there are thirty-eight bandit bands with over fifty people operating long-term in the whole county; seven with over one hundred people, not including many home-dwelling bandits who farm in normal times and act as bandits when things happen."

This figure caused a commotion in the crowd. One had to know the actual population of Lingao, according to the Civil Affairs Department's estimate, was about seventy to eighty thousand. A county with less than one hundred thousand people actually had so many bandits!

Due to the geographical environment, the activities of bandits here had the characteristic of colluding with pirates. Every time pirates landed, there was collusion with bandits, and bandit dens often became pirate dens. And once bandits were chased urgently by the government or militia, they would use pirate ships to hide at sea. This made bandit suppression very difficult. Successive magistrates hadn't thought of methods, but the effect was very limited. Extensive establishment of militias and training village braves could only provide limited local self-protection effects.

If the transmigrators wanted to implement social surveys and conduct civil affairs and agricultural reforms in Lingao, it was impossible without a stable social order. It couldn't be imagined that every work team of transmigrators going to the countryside had to be escorted by a large amount of armed force. And the various infrastructure construction to be carried out subsequently couldn't have gun towers built along the entire line with soldiers standing guard for protection.
