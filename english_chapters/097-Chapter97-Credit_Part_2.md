# Chapter 97: Credit (Part 2)

Work-point voucher statistics from the first issuance and recovery were quickly compiled: 815.3 points issued, 334 points recovered—a 40% same-day recovery. First-time recipients eager to convert to goods was understandable. Over the next few days, remaining tokens gradually returned, but much slower than expected. Wu Nanhai breathed relief—on issuance day, he'd consumed about 60 extra kilograms of rice and grains.

But work-point voucher credit was basically established. Though some remained skeptical, these paper slips genuinely bought extra food from the food cart daily. Next, Wu Nanhai began selling locally-produced rice wine—5 points per 250g bottle. To prevent drunken incidents, weekly sales were limited to one bottle per person. But sales were surprisingly poor—puzzling Wu Nanhai. This batch was from Zhang Xingfu's prisoner-affairs tribute; he'd specifically asked prisoners, who all said it was the county's better rice wine.

If it was quality, why such low sales? After weeks of working with the Production Team, he could now roughly communicate in a Lingao-Mandarin hybrid. Most answered: "Too expensive—can't afford."

Hearing this, Wu De laughed happily: "Good news."

"What's good about it?" Wu Nanhai had hoped wine would reclaim some vouchers, reducing grain consumption.

"It means they recognize the voucher's value!" Wu De said. "They think it's money now—that's why they feel this way. If these were 1949 Gold Yuan Certificates, would anyone care about prices? Just being able to buy anything would be enough."

Wu Nanhai suddenly understood, chuckling ruefully. He'd never considered this.

"You didn't think from their perspective—and many here haven't either, assuming these people should naturally trust the voucher's value." Wu De smiled wryly. "It's all about what you think they should do, what I think they should do. Right? Everyone forgets these are living people too—each with their own calculations. Why should they easily trust you?"

"True."

"So we must be careful." Wu De said. "Credit—it can't be built in a day or two." Just then, Lin Xing's voice reported from outside.

"Come in."

The new Production Team captain wore brand-new homespun clothes styled after transmigrator training uniforms. The handiwork was rough, but they fit reasonably well.

"What is it?"

"I—I—" Lin Xing's Mandarin was quite good now, just with a slight Xiong Buyou-style Guangxi accent. "I have a request for the Master."

"Go on."

Lin Xing knelt and kowtowed before speaking. Many Production Team members were tenant farmers; they'd been away over a month now. The autumn harvest was imminent, and many worried that without returning to harvest, their families would lack labor, couldn't gather grain, and couldn't pay rent—if landlords evicted them, the whole family would starve.

"Everyone chose me to beg the Master's mercy—let everyone return to see family, finish this season's farmwork, then come back." Lin Xing kowtowed again.

Wanting to go home? It wasn't surprising to Wu De. Unattached singles were a minority; most Production Team members owned no land but had families—impossible to abandon. Such thoughts were completely reasonable.

But once released, would they return? Wu De wasn't certain. From gathered intelligence on laborer attitudes, most felt working here was similar to laboring for landlords; after implementing work-points, enthusiasm had increased. But how many would work for them long-term and permanently?

He hesitated, first dismissing Lin Xing.

"This is difficult to handle." Wu Nanhai also found it challenging. "Request instructions from the Committee?"

That evening, the Committee held an expanded meeting specifically to discuss letting laborers go home for farming. Many professional groups opposed it—especially Industrial Committee groups entering the construction-installation peak. Losing this labor would greatly slow progress. The brick-kiln's new cement vertical-kiln project already lacked labor; suddenly releasing a hundred trained workers would create an impossible gap.

Wu De was torn: releasing them clearly hurt current production; not releasing, when Lin Xing specifically came to petition, showed this issue had strong sentiment in the Production Team. Not releasing would severely lose hard-won hearts.

Unable to decide, he described all his thoughts and concerns. Finally, he said: better to let them return once. Even losing many people, their righteousness and trustworthiness would earn local recognition.

"Righteousness and trustworthiness?" Someone sneered. "We timespace invaders talk about that?" This was Machinery Group's Comrade Xiao Bailang—fair-faced, rather delicate, somewhat femme. His face was flushed now, speaking aggressively.

"So we should be despicable?"

"Save it," the other immediately retorted. "What did we come here for? Don't pretend you're all here for communist ideals or bringing democracy and freedom to the Chinese people. Honestly, everyone came for wealth and lolis, right?" He scanned attendees. "I'm sick of this inexplicable benevolence-righteousness-propriety-wisdom-faithfulness bullshit. Conquer Lingao, grab everyone for labor; not enough, take villages one by one. We'll soon mass-produce explosives—yet we cower here discussing credit with natives. Ridiculous beyond ridiculous."

"Enslavement can't build anything lasting..."

"What's wrong with enslavement? Didn't the Qing rule China for three hundred years through brutal Han enslavement? If pig-oiled, pig-skinned Tungusic savages could do it, can't we 21st-century moderns?"

"I absolutely oppose this!" Cheng Dong stood, fiercely objecting. "Though ends sometimes justify means, basic moral bottom lines should exist. This would lose the people's hearts!"

"People's hearts?" Xiao Bailang scoffed. "Unfortunately, by historical patterns, hearts aren't necessarily a match for force. If hearts ever defeated force, it's because the force wasn't enough! Ancient commoners could rebel—see any modern civilian uprisings? At most, 'collective walks' or 'mass incidents.' Our tech and industrial capability compared to this era's people is like Zentradi versus Earth—do Zentradi care about Earthlings' hearts?"

This inflammatory speech stirred resonance in many. Seeing whispers spread, Xiao Bailang grew bolder:

"I propose: not only don't release people—immediately launch 'Hunting Operations'!" He waved his arms forcefully. "Mass-capture labor, organize them for forced labor. Can't meet quotas—no food. Resist—beheading..." His spittle flew as he grew more excited.

"I object!" Wu De, hearing him go increasingly extreme, feared his two-plus months of work would be destroyed. "We need locals' loyalty. Without their support, do we rule with just five hundred people?"

"What's to fear?" Xiao Bailang dismissed. "Collaborators are always abundant—Green Standard armies, Peace Armies, Imperial Collaboration Armies. Give them food and recruit as many fighters as you want—"

Cheng Dong, the pacifist, couldn't bear it: "So you want us to match Tungusic savages' or Japanese devils' moral standards?"

"What do you think we are?" Xiao Bailang snorted. "What right do we have to be here? By what authority do we occupy this land? Is Lingao transmigrators' 'inseparable territory since ancient times'? We're timespace invaders—stop the cosmetic pretense!"

The meeting threatened to lose control. So far, no one had publicly supported Xiao Bailang—but clearly his words were highly inflammatory. Wen Desi sensed danger. This naked, morally-indifferent, interest-supremacist expression had powerful mass appeal. Deep down, he didn't actually dislike Xiao Bailang's speech—essentially correct. But many things couldn't be said so nakedly—dangerous.

Thinking how to stop this, Zhan Wuya stood up and called out: "Little Xiao, stop talking! People should have some bottom line—we can't just do whatever benefits us."

"Bottom line? Everyone came here to do what—poverty alleviation?..."

"Bullshit!" Zhan Wuya exploded in fury. "Two days ago, if I hadn't rushed over to cut the power, you'd only have one hand left today! By your logic—how many hands you have, why should I care?!"

Xiao Bailang deflated. Wen Desi silently thanked luck—honestly, continuing this debate could've led anywhere. Though Xiao Bailang's extremist proposal wouldn't pass, debate's rifts would be hard to mend. Fortunately, Zhan Wuya stepped in—he knew nothing about this minor incident—but no time for details. Seizing this pause, he quickly stood:

"Everyone, stop arguing. Please focus on the topic. How can we maximize our interests while ensuring our environment remains stable long-term?"

This set the tone for the subsequent discussion. Various others expressed views—some agreeing, some not. It was roughly half-and-half. All explained their reasoning from different angles. Finally, the Committee decided to vote. Results: those supporting release slightly prevailed.

Leaving the conference room, Wu De felt drenched in cold sweat. He wanted to release them—but whether outcomes would match his expectations was uncertain. After all, between him and these 17th-century natives lay 400 years of history.
