# Chapter 92 - New Farm (2)

"Then your physical strength is maintained really well."

"You make it sound like I'm very old, I'm only thirty!"

"Ah?"

"Working at the grassroots level for a long time makes one look like this." Yang Baogui's smile was very sunny, "Let's walk together." He shouted, "Beibei, go! Drive Ukraine back!" Following his shout, a dog ran out quickly and drove back a large white pig attempting to dash to the roadside to gnaw bark.

"Its name is Beibei?"

"Correct, six in total, exactly: 'Beibei', 'Jingjing', 'Huanhuan', 'Yingying', 'Nini'."

"What about one more?" Wu Nanhai was infected by his bad taste and was eager to know what the last one was called.

"Called Aoyun (Olympics) of course." Yang Baogui said with a serious face, and roared again: "Aoyun!" A dog originally walking quietly suddenly jumped up, ran to his feet, and circled happily. He stroked its neck fur with satisfaction.

"You really know how to train dogs."

"This is my specialty, not profession. Purely for fun." Yang Baogui waved the whip, cracking it loudly, "I can also drive a big cart. Learned from farmers in the countryside. Just that there are no big carts here. I went to the Industrial Group and asked them to make a few big carts with rubber tires. Harnessed with the Dian horses we captured, a two-horse cart pulling a thousand jin is no problem. This group of people chirped that this kind of cart is backward, and are working hard to tackle key problems to develop some four-wheeled farm wagon. It's all bullshit. Can small horses pull that kind of wagon?"

"Tieling draft horses can definitely pull it," Wu Nanhai looked at the two particularly tall and strong heavy horses in the queue. This is the best draft horse bred in China since the founding of the country in 1949. It has the bloodlines of many of the best draft and riding horses in Europe. The maximum draft force can reach 450 kg, and a single horse can pull a double rubber-tired cart with a load of 1000 kg.

"Can pull, but these two must be kept as breeding horses, not suitable for much work. And the horse breed of Tieling draft horse has actually degenerated a lot." (Note: Tieling draft horse stopped breeding work in the 90s, and only a very small number of degenerated breeding horses exist now. This horse breed will disappear soon) Yang Baogui sighed as he spoke, "Nanhai, to be honest, I am very worried about our Agriculture Group."

"En, I also feel some problems, but there are thousands of threads, don't know where to start talking?" He imitated Yang Baogui, waving the willow branch in his hand to drive the livestock.

"Nanhai, you studied agriculture, you should know what the basis of high yield in modern agriculture is, right?"

"Pesticides, chemical fertilizers, good seeds, water conservancy, GMO, soil chemistry..." Wu Nanhai said,
"Is it possible to copy such a model here?"

"Relatively difficult. Conditions are too poor. Engaging in farmland water conservancy and promoting good seeds are relatively realistic means of increasing production." Wu Nanhai pondered, "Chemical fertilizers are okay to say. After the Chemical Group tinkers out the combined ammonia manufacturing plant and sulfuric acid plant, it will be fine. But pesticides are difficult. This requires organic chemical industry. I think it's impossible without thirty or forty years of industrial development accumulation."

"No," Yang Baogui shook his head, "These problems are still superficial. The biggest problem is that modern society is a large division of labor system, and agriculture is no exception. Under such a division of labor system, the professional ability of us agricultural technicians has actually degenerated—farmers too.

"In the past, farmers had to select seeds and raise seedlings themselves. Now just go buy seeds directly. Agricultural technicians actually just know what seeds to use, how to manage after sowing, when to spray what pesticides, apply what fertilizer..."

"Here there are no seed companies, nor pesticide factories, veterinary drug factories, agricultural machinery stations... everything has to be done by ourselves. We were all cultivated under this large division of labor system, only understanding the part we do. Modern agriculture is a complete chain, and we only have some scattered links."

He pointed to the few pigs being driven by dogs to walk: "Take those pigs for example—Georgia! Where are you running to!" Yang Baogui scolded loudly and drove a pig back to the road with the whip, "Everyone counts on them to develop large-scale pig raising industry and live a life of eating meat every meal, right? No one knows how many vaccines a piglet has to take and how much medicine it has to eat from birth to slaughter in a modern pig farm, and how much medicine is used just for disinfection in the pigsty. Just like this, if swine fever breaks out accidentally, a large batch will still die."

Wu Nanhai became worried by his words. He hadn't thought about these problems, but never considered them so deeply.

"It seems we have to rebuild item by item." He looked at those carefree pigs humming and looking for food while walking, "Do they also have names?"

"Yes, all are breeding boars and sows, easier to remember with names."

"What names?"

"Ukraine, Big Bobo (Poland), Georgia, Russia—"

"Haha, Russia must be that boar, right?" Wu Nanhai pointed to that fiercest and biggest pig.

"No, that one is called Soviet Union."

The two chatted while walking. The more than ten kilometers of simple highway was maintained quite well. Except for a bit of dust after cars passed, driving livestock walking leisurely on the road. On one side was the surging Wenlan River. In the sparse farmland on both banks, rice ears were already ripe, but there was no familiar scene of rolling rice waves—agriculture here was still quite backward. Wu Nanhai lamented all the way, thinking about how to turn everyone's knowledge into productivity, but the difficulties in front of him were layer upon layer.

The road was very calm. Although occasionally some local people could be seen working in the fields, they were all far away. Several towers along the road also gave the coming and going transmigrators a great sense of security. These originally rough wooden structure towers had now been rebuilt into three-story gun towers of brick-stone mixed structure. Searchlights were installed on the roof, and there was an open space surrounded by deep trenches and barbed wire downstairs. Once any attack event occurred, pedestrians and vehicles on the road could quickly hide inside.

The entire marching column walked for almost three hours before arriving at the camp at Bairen Beach. All members of the Agricultural Committee were waiting for them—today was the day the Agricultural Committee officially moved into the new site.

Unlike those departments already stationed in the Executive Committee compound, the full set of the Agricultural Committee team was set in a place later called "Nanhai Model Demonstration Farm". Wu Nanhai had received education in university: agriculture is not produced by sitting in the office writing plans and making reports, but by every agricultural technician working down-to-earth in the land, fish ponds, and orchards step by step. As an agricultural technician, one must live near the farmland.

The entire farm was built with red bricks newly produced by the brick kiln. There was probably no more imposing architectural complex than here in the entire Bairen City: offices, agricultural technology laboratories, warehouses, agricultural machinery stations, cellars, neatly arranged barns; by the river was a water mill, and newly built livestock pens emitted the fragrance of logs. The only concrete building was a row of hydraulic biogas digesters—treating various garbage, wastewater, and feces discharged from the living area and agricultural area. The produced biogas was supplied to the cafeteria for cooking. In the future when there is more waste, more biogas produced can be used for power generation. Biogas slurry is good for fertilization or feed additives, and the final biogas residue is also excellent fertilizer.

Originally there was a permanent glass greenhouse in the construction plan, but now the industrial department hasn't manufactured glass yet, so postpone it temporarily. Fortunately, Hainan has a subtropical climate anyway. Even in the Little Ice Age, the accumulated temperature is sufficient.

"The place allocated to us as experimental fields," Ye Yuming pointed to the marker serving as the land boundary, "extends from here all the way to the water mill by the river."

From here to the river is a distance of more than 100 meters, and the length is also 200 meters. It is an irregular long rectangle. Calculated, it is about twenty mu in modern area. No problem using it as vegetable fields and experimental fields. A small part of this land has now been leveled, sown with some vegetables like cabbage, green vegetables, green peppers, and tomatoes. At this time, some vegetables have entered the harvesting period, and the dining table in the cafeteria can be slightly richer.

However, most of the land is still in a state of more stones and less soil, with many tree roots remaining. Land leveling is needed, and maybe some soil needs to be transported over. He observed the height of the river bank and the water line during the high-water period, estimating how many irrigation canals were needed and whether flood control embankments and other water conservancy facilities needed to be built. Where fruit trees could be planted, fish ponds dug, and where the brought tropical crop seedlings temporarily settled, all these had to be considered one by one.

The space of the entire Agricultural Committee building complex cannot be let go either. Courtyard economy can be engaged. Just build a grape trellis on the aisle in the yard. Half a mu of grape trellis can harvest 1000 jin of grapes, occupying no land and providing shade. Some fruit trees can be planted behind the house...

He calculated in his heart, feeling happy. But now labor is insufficient. Have to ask Wu De to allocate a few local farmers to help work—best if can hire them directly as long-term laborers. As for the local agricultural situation, best to find a landlord to ask, but heard that landlords and rich peasants have all been released. What a pity. The agricultural production experience of such people is very rich, and they also know more about the social state of the countryside. But he couldn't speak Lingao dialect, had to find someone to translate, troublesome. It seems better to learn it himself. Needless to say anything else, later marrying a wife and taking concubines must have some emotional communication, right? Could it be starting from a o e i (pinyin vowels)? But let's talk about these tomorrow. Walking for several hours, he was really too tired.

That day he fell asleep in the office of the Agricultural Committee. After so many days, finally having tiles over his head and being able to sleep in a house, he actually had a very happy feeling. It seems that happiness really depends on comparison.
