# Chapter 2048 - Talent Shi Misi (Smith)

"I heard rumors on the street saying the house is to be confiscated. As you instructed, I didn't go inquire."

"Mm, that's right." The middle-aged man sighed deeply. "These hair-thieves seem crude, but are actually deep thinkers with plans for everything, all interlinked. You must have realized what they intend to do to the city's gentry. Remember, especially at this time, you and I must stay calm and act carefully. One wrong move means eternal damnation."

"I understand, but the Lin family..."

"Don't worry too much. Young Master Liang has his own arrangements."

"But Young Master Lin contributed plenty of money and effort. Doing this might chill people's hearts."

"Are the hair-thieves so easy to deal with? A few days ago, real hair-thieves led the team to the Liang mansion. Making such a fuss, would they let it go without scraping some flesh? Doing great things requires ignoring trifles. Besides, Young Master Lin didn't know anything anyway. The hair-thieves are cruel but don't aim to destroy hearts. The Lin family offended the new dynasty; spending money to avoid disaster won't hinder the big picture." Seeing Advisor Liao wanting to speak again, the middle-aged man waved to interrupt him. "The account clearing at the beginning of the year was done very well. That fake hair-thief minor leader at the Liang mansion found nothing these past days. Tomorrow I'll show a few flaws to let him finish the job and send him away. But on your side, are the account books for the monetary dealings of *that matter* still kept?"

"As Second Brother ordered, all burned..."

"Really? Speaking privately as brothers, if you haven't burned them, hurry and copy a set while you still remember..." The middle-aged man said in a low, meaningful voice. "One cannot rely on others entirely. Beware of being cast aside after serving your purpose. These private accounts are your final life-saving talisman."

"Understood, understood." Advisor Liao nodded while glancing sideways at the middle-aged man. "Is Second Brother going back tonight?"

"At this hour? The streets are full of police and foreigners. Are you trying to get me in trouble?"

"Haha, then stay at my place, Second Brother." Advisor Liao took the cloth off the window, went out, and clapped twice. "Manager Zhou, call those two girls to help Master Mai relax..."

There's nothing worse than dreaming about a man, except remembering it after waking up. Wang Qiyi thought indignantly.

Yesterday his wife had finally come to Guangzhou, and after several happy rounds of deep exchange at night, he should have slept comfortably. Unexpectedly, he dreamt of Shi Misi.

Damn it all. The more Wang Qiyi thought, the more awkward he felt, regretting making trouble for himself by insisting on calling this "talent" to the office yesterday for a "tax-enterprise discussion." This man's looks were truly sorry—fat and seemingly a bit lame? At first, Wang Qiyi worried he would feign ignorance, so he deliberately tried to trap him with words. But he soon found his worries unnecessary. This Second Master Shi didn't shy away from showing his understanding of the Council of Elders' various policies and technologies. He even knew the importance of newspapers, reading the meaning behind the articles—this opened Wang Qiyi's eyes.

There had been smart people among the natives before, but conversations with them were boring—either "Chief is reasonable" or "I hadn't thought it through," "teaching fish to swim." Unlike this Shi Misi, who had some confidence and spoke logically about why his business operated the way it did, without the servile look of those natives who kowtow and admit guilt as soon as an Elder asks a question. Near the end of the conversation, Wang Qiyi mentioned the Lin family. Shi Misi frankly said the Lin family still operated according to custom; he had advised Lin Zunxiu, but not being the head of houeshold, his words didn't count. His own family had ceased monetary dealings with the Lin family after paying taxes in the first quarter and was currently clearing accounts.

A shrewd person—but sold his teammates too fast. Aren't you all part of that "Yuyuan Society"? Really disloyal. While admiring his knowledge, Wang Qiyi deeply despised these gentry scions in his heart.

But ultimately, family interests are always paramount, let alone such "teammates."

Second Master Shi's look of open-mindedness made Wang Qiyi very uncomfortable. After all, he was just "exploiting legal loopholes," not "breaking the law."

"This person is truly a talent! But using him probably won't be as reassuring as other native collaborators."

Native collaborators like Gao Ju and Zhang Yu, though having their own calculations, actually relied on a certain "personal relationship" with the Council of Elders. They valued their personal relationship with their contact Elder highly, tried every way to "maintain" this relationship. Though they studied the Council of Elders' laws and policies, they didn't understand them thoroughly, relying more on the Elder's private "interpretation." They might question the regulations but executed them quite vigorously. In short, their relationship was based on trust mixing "profit," "personal affection," and "long-term partnership."

Second Master Shi's approach was completely different. They knew they couldn't latch onto the Council of Elders quickly, let alone gain "trust," but they understood the secrets of the Council of Elders' governance faster than other traditional merchants, fully utilizing "the Council of Elders' rule of law" to profit for themselves.

Such people, compared to the merchants supported by the Council of Elders, though suspected of "barbaric growth," were undeniably the most vibrant and thoughtful group.

If such people could be controlled, they would be helpful to the Council of Elders' great cause. But once they stumbled, they would become extra-large time bombs, causing huge trouble—Wang Qiyi had seen many such cases in the old timeline.

Truly a dilemma. Wang Qiyi looked at Shi Misi's file on the table, worrying secretly.

That wasn't the only annoying thing. At breakfast, Wang Qiyi got confirmation from Ai Zhixin that the application for Salina to transfer to the Economic Crimes Investigation Division had been rejected. Since getting preliminary approval from Cheng Dong over two weeks ago, Ai Zhixin and he had been preparing systems, personnel, positions, and office space, hoping to make Salina feel valued so she could work steadily in the new post. After all, in this political monstrosity of the Council of Elders, having one more Elder in the department meant more than just another worker. It also meant disguisedly strengthening the department's voice in the Council. Now this back-and-forth gave both of them a great sense of frustration. Even stranger was the Administration Council's reason for rejection: Salina's post was important and unsuitable for transfer or concurrent post. If Wang Qiyi didn't know from his wife's letter what had actually happened in the Council, he would have thought the Administration Council bigwigs were too lazy to even make up a proper reason.

This transfer, which seemed very appropriate to the Administration Council bigwigs, inevitably sparked factional disputes during implementation.

Their application faced resistance from the start. First, the Han-Supremacists questioned whether the Xue Ziliang and Salina pair, both ABCs/new whites, held positions that were too important. The Special Reconnaissance Team and Elder Security Bureau (commonly known as Secret Service) were conspicuous enough; now they wanted to add more. Many others felt Salina must be "North American Gang" or "Otaku Party," and since the "Otaku Party" had Qian Shuiting in the center, Xue Ziliang and Qian Shuixie in the military, Panpan in propaganda, and Zheng Shangjie in commerce, Salina taking charge of the Economic Crimes Investigation Division would mean occupying a core position in finance too. If the "Otaku Party" successfully extended their reach this time, they would lack nothing in power, money, guns, and mouthpiece—their rise to dominance would be set in stone. This made many people uncomfortable.

Such noise didn't affect the Administration Council's judgment initially; the transfer application passed the first review. But an unexpected event later caused a storm in the Council, directly smashing the Finance Department's calculations.

At the inception of the Council of Elders' Navy, the Navy faction aspired to build an imperial navy far surpassing the old timeline's UK (British Empire) to sail the seven seas. Naturally, as a target to emulate and surpass, the British Navy's "engage the enemy upon sight" regulation was enshrined as a golden rule. "The rule of engaging the enemy upon sight witnessed and guided the British Empire Navy from weakness to strength, from the North Atlantic to dominating the seven seas. Now, we—yes, we—must engrave it into our own imperial navy's genes. Let our warriors courageously charge forward! The crown of maritime hegemony can only be forged by naval guns!" So said Elder Wang, then a staff officer in the Navy Command, when interpreting this operational principle at the Elder Assembly. At the time, the Council Navy had just swept away Zheng芝long with irresistible force, and Liu Xiang had surrendered with his whole gang. Everyone felt like kings sweeping the world. Hearing Staff Officer Wang's impassioned "interpretation," some emotional Elders even jumped onto their seats, pumping their fists and shouting slogans to support the Navy. The Navy matter passed easily without objection, except for the somewhat dark faces of "Young Officers Club" members like Wei Aiwen and Zhang Berlin.

However, impassioned emotions can't put food on the table, nor solve practical problems. Just over a month ago, a certain soy-sauce-type (terms like soy sauce, idler, etc., suspected of discrimination, have been deemed sensitive words by the Council) Elder, while returning to Hainan from official business with "Eunuch Zhao" in Hangzhou, was aboard a navy warship night-sailing when the lookout spotted an unidentified vessel. The duty officer immediately rang the bell to assemble according to regulations. Unable to visually identify friend or foe, and receiving no response to the first light signal query, the captain followed the "engage upon sight" principle and immediately commanded the ship to seize attack position, preparing to engage. At this point, the awakened passenger Elder came to ask about the situation. Upon hearing the warship he was on was about to enter combat, and especially hearing the other ship probably wasn't as fast as his, he immediately refused, demanding the captain prioritize his safety, abandon combat, and turn away immediately, threatening to relieve the captain of command. During the wrangling, the opposing ship entered range. The naturalized captain ignored the Elder's threat and ordered fire. After a broadside, the opponent stopped immediately. The navy inspection found it was a smuggler ship that hadn't bought a sailing flag.
