# Chapter 1436 - The Secret of the Shipyard

No one noticed when the black-clad man left the third tier of the stands. The crowd was immersed in fanatical clamor, followed by a not-so-small riot. The white captain, due to excessive excitement, broke his seat board and rolled down from the upper tier. Fortunately, he suffered no physical injuries, but he lay stiffly on the ground, groaning in pain along with those he had crushed.

An hour later, the captain staggered into a tavern in the Pasig River dock area, ordered a large glass of tuba made from coconut juice—almost the cheapest alcoholic beverage in the Philippines—and cursed the ruthlessness of fate while drinking.

"Captain Fernando," someone greeted him. The captain found a young Chinese man standing in front of him, wearing a straw hat and a typical Chinese buttoned jacket, but European-style sailor trousers below. He seemed to deliberately push his pottery wine cup in front of the captain. Fernando's eyes widened, his nose twitching, greedily inhaling the aroma of rhubarb liqueur. An unimpressive-looking Chinese man could actually afford "Princess of Tang" liqueur, which was quite expensive in Manila!

"My master is in the private room next door. He wants to treat Mr. Fernando to a few good drinks. Please follow me." The Chinese man turned and walked away. His movement of picking up the wine cup was very slow. The captain's eyelids twitched: in the Chinese man's hand beneath the ordinary pottery cup, something golden was revealed. The other party had already turned around; Fernando reached out and pressed down on the gold coin, slowly sweeping it into his sleeve.

"Who cares," the captain muttered to himself. "Anyway, I've lost everything already." He put down his glass, grabbed his hat, and followed the Chinese man's back to the rear room of the tavern.

Fernando squinted. The change in light from the bright outer room to the dark compartment in the back made his eyes uncomfortable. There were no windows in the compartment. The door closed behind him; the only light source inside came from a crude coconut oil lamp on the table. The flame flickered as if struggling, barely illuminating half the table. After his eyes gradually adapted to the dim, flickering light of the private room, he saw a somewhat hunched figure sitting behind the table, his seat seemingly deliberately avoiding the faint light of the oil lamp.

"Please sit, De Fernando." The hunchback, whose body was mostly hidden in darkness, spoke in a deliberately altered, hoarse voice. Captain Fernando sat in the chair opposite, slightly startled: not many people in Manila knew his home country, yet this mysterious figure spoke French.

The Chinese man brought cups and plates for Fernando, filled them with liqueur, and then retreated to the door, seemingly uninterested in any conversation.

"De Fernando, a question about you has been bothering me," if anything could stop Fernando from guzzling the liqueur, it was this mysterious figure's question. "Which God do you believe in? The Vatican, or the Huguenots'?"

The captain's hand trembled, not noticing that he had spilled his wine on the table. Breaking out of the encirclement at La Rochelle, risking his life for Muslim Pashas in the Barbary Coast and nearly dying from Portuguese cannonballs; transporting goods for the English in Surat only to be attacked by the Dutch East India Company, losing both ship and cargo. He had never mentioned these experiences to anyone, at least not when sober. In territories ruled by Spaniards, a Huguenot would have no end other than being sent to the stake.

"God is the only true God," the captain said slowly.

The figure in the darkness moved in the chair. The captain now saw that most of the man's body was wrapped in a black cloak, his face covered by a black half-mask, revealing a meticulously trimmed beard.

"Captain Fernando, I know you are a businessman," the black-clad man switched to Spanish using the formal "Usted". "A businessman has only one God."

He raised his right hand. The black kidskin glove made Fernando shiver: as if sitting opposite him was a non-human monster wrapped in a black shell. The black hand opened, and a handful of ducats rolled onto the table with a clatter. Several hit the captain's wine glass before falling, making the crisp sound of gold. "The Gospel of God is indispensable, my friend, especially after a heavy gamble."

Fernando's eager eyes focused on the gold coins. Under the flickering and dim light, the entire tabletop seemed to dance with golden brilliance.

"Sir, you wouldn't make up for my losses for free, would you?" He tried hard to swallow some saliva to lubricate his dry throat, even forgetting the fine wine placed before him.

"Under the shed in the Manila shipyard, what kind of ship is there exactly? Why does His Excellency the Governor value it so much? Mr. De Fernando?"

The private room suddenly fell silent; only Fernando's heavy, panting breaths could be heard. "That is His Excellency the Governor's secret—"

"Mr. Salamanca hired you to command that small boat under construction because you are a brave enough captain, and also because you are always short of money," the black-clad man squeezed a chuckle through his teeth. "I want to know, what kind of ship is it exactly? That requires a captain like you, who dares to risk his life, to command it?"

"Brave Captain" Mr. De Fernando sweated on his forehead. This was the Governor's great secret. In all of Manila, only four people knew the true situation of this ship. Once leaked, the consequences would be unimaginable.

"You need money, my friend. I have no ties with Mr. Salamanca or those priests in Manila, and I don't like their paranoid fanaticism. I want to know what that ship and the shipyard are busy with right now," the black-clad man placed a purse on the table, untied the ribbon, grabbed a handful of gold coins, and let them fall one by one through his fingers. With each crisp clink, Fernando's pupils contracted. "I am also a businessman, dear Fernando. This is just a business deal, just a business deal."

When the black-clad man left the tavern with his Chinese attendant, the sun was about to set. They walked out of the tavern and boarded a canvas-covered oxcart. There were hundreds, if not thousands, of such oxcarts in and around Manila. The oxcart finally stopped in front of a warehouse surrounded by a walled courtyard and drove away after the two got off. The dock area by the Pasig River was full of such crude log-and-thatch warehouses. The black-clad man went through the back door of the courtyard, took out a key, opened the padlock, and walked into the warehouse with the Chinese man. The warehouse door closed behind them. When it opened again a quarter of an hour later, the black cloak and mask were gone, the beard glued to the chin was torn off, and the cotton padding stuffed in the back to fake a hunchback—Purpo—was also removed. Count Fananovoua mounted a horse tied in the courtyard and left through the front gate. Moments later, Jimide put on a Chinese long gown, swapped his sailor's straw hat for a skullcap, and hurried toward the next contact point in the Parian district.

Mr. Geronimo Paño had been suffering from severe headaches lately, as if all the foul air in his body had rushed to his brain. But even if his skull split open, he didn't want to see a doctor. Those doctors only knew how to bleed people, and he didn't dare let that barber, who was drunk all day, cut open his arm.

Priests proficient in medicine were not keen on bleeding people, or he could try a Chinese doctor. However, Geronimo Paño knew that his headache was actually not a medical issue; as the person in charge of the Royal Shipyard, his suffering stemmed from a damned contract: to build 12 new patrol sloops for the East Indies colony.

In the end, everything should be blamed on that bastard Japanese, the infinitely evil Paulo Takayama. The design and model of that single-masted lateen-rigged sloop were said to be his work. He also instigated the Governor to use them to replace the obsolete galleys and crude rowing boats, which would give the colonial fleet a new look. Of course, anyone who saw Takayama's personal ship would know that these so-called patrol sloops were based on his ship.

Geronimo Paño was also one of the few who passionately seconded the proposal at the time. No one could be indifferent to the money brought by such a large order and the praise to be gained upon completion. Only after he undertook the entire shipbuilding order and impatiently ordered work to start did he realize he had fallen into a big pit.

The requirements Paulo Takayama put forward for this seemingly simple small boat were bizarre: strange rigging, picky demands on the size and quality of ship timber—let alone that; he actually demanded the entire hull below the waterline be sheathed in copper. Geronimo, who had been a shipwright for more than twenty years, had never heard of such an absurd thing. Even the great galleons crossing the Pacific only had their bottoms covered with a layer of tarred canvas and a little lead sheeting. Geronimo decided to coat the new patrol boats with two layers of wood tar; at least that would ensure they were durable enough. As for copper sheathing, go to hell; all the copper in Manila had been collected for that Japanese genius to make his precious cannons.

This wasn't even the most outrageous part. Mr. Salamanca, listening to god knows what nonsense from that Japanese bastard, actually asked Geronimo Paño to his face if the keels and ribs of the new ships could be made of iron. If not for the Governor's noble status, Geronimo Paño would have laughed his belly open. No one in this world had the ability to bend pig iron into the shape of ship ribs. Furthermore, even if cast, its brittleness made it unsuitable for keels and ribs. As for wrought iron, leaving aside where Manila would get so much wrought iron, just how to process such large forgings was a huge problem.

The shipyard director interpreted this as the Governor worrying about whether his products were strong enough. He had to use double the material on key parts. Fortunately, there was never a shortage of excellent shipbuilding hardwood here. But now the dry timber stocked for years was about to run out, yet not even one-third of the project had been completed.
