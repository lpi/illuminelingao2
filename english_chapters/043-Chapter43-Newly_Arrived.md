# Chapter 43 - Newly Arrived

Chapter 43 Newly Arrived

The Fengcheng anchored at the sea surface off Bopu Harbor.

Wen Desi led the landing team to land first.

"We are back!" Wen Desi shouted, stepping on the soft beach.

Bei Wei and Lin Baiguang, who had been waiting for a long time, greeted them.

"President Wen! You are finally back!"

"How is the situation?"

"Everything is normal." Bei Wei reported, "The construction of the camp has been completed, and the defense facilities have also been strengthened."

"Good." Wen Desi nodded, "Inform the big ship to start unloading."

So, a mighty unloading operation began.

Landing craft, fishing boats, rafts... all kinds of water transport vehicles shuttled back and forth between the Fengcheng and the beach.

Crates of materials were transported to the shore.
Groups of people landed on the beach.

The originally desolate beach instantly became boiling.

"Quick! Move this generator to the power station!"
"Be careful! This is a precision instrument, don't bump it!"
"Where is the Cooking Squad? Cook immediately! Everyone is hungry!"

Under the unified command of the Executive Committee, everything proceeded in an orderly manner.

The local fishermen and villagers watched this scene from a distance, dumbfounded.

"Are these... heavenly soldiers and generals?"

"Look at that big ship, it's bigger than a mountain!"

"Look at those iron monsters (vehicles), running so fast without eating grass!"

Some bold villagers tried to approach, wanting to see what was happening.

"Fellow folks, don't be afraid." Xiao Zishan walked over with a smile, holding a basket of steamed buns in his hand, "We are merchants from overseas, here to do business and settle down. Come, eat a steamed bun."

The white and fragrant steamed buns instantly captured the hearts of the villagers.

"Good people! These are good people!" The villagers ate steamed buns and praised one after another.

With the temptation of food and materials, the Transmigrators quickly established a good relationship with the local people.

They hired villagers to help carry things and build houses, paying wages with grain and cloth.
They also set up a free clinic to treat the villagers for free.

"The Australians are living Bodhisattvas!" This sentence spread quickly in Lingao.

However, not everyone welcomed their arrival.

In the county yamen of Lingao, the magistrate Wu Ming (a fictional name) was frowning.

"Where did these people come from? So many people, so many ships... Are they trying to rebel?"

"My Lord, they say they are merchants." The head of constables reported.

"Merchants? Have you ever seen merchants with guns and cannons?" Magistrate Wu snorted, "Check! Find out their background immediately!"

"Yes!"

A storm was brewing.
