# Chapter 2596 - Investigation (Part 19)

As for why this gang desperately plucked wool from Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital, the reasons were easy to guess. It had the highest patient volume, the most drug usage, and crucially the highest number of naturalized citizen employee patients. Only here could the trick of using fake prescriptions to extract publicly-funded medical drugs be employed. The more numerous and scattered civilian medical institutions had very few naturalized citizen employee patients—extracting drugs there was very inconvenient. This drove the criminals to focus on Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital.

If extended further, Lingao General Hospital and Joint Logistics' subordinate Army and Navy hospitals and Joint Logistics General Hospital were all major users of "publicly-funded medical" drugs. Their loopholes probably weren't small either.

"Getting prescriptions from private institutions, then extracting drugs from public hospitals—brilliant! Truly brilliant!" Zheng Mingjiang thought. "Apparently, publicly-funded drug prescriptions need to be separated from self-pay drug prescriptions in the future. That would basically plug the prescription loophole."

But that was for later. The immediate priority was plugging the Provincial-Hong Kong hole.

Additionally, during the joint investigation, they discovered some other forms of parasites. Outside Provincial-Hong Kong Hospital's main gate, even in hospital restrooms, there were advertisements for buying drugs. Seeing such advertisements exist, Zheng Mingjiang knew some naturalized citizen employees were certainly exploiting their "publicly-funded medical" benefits, extracting drugs at the hospital to resell to medicine peddlers.

Though timelines differed, wherever arbitrage space existed, people would naturally think of ways to profit.

Knowing the drug extraction tricks, Zheng Mingjiang immediately transferred the relevant leads to Wu Mu. After a secret investigation, the investigation team quickly drafted a list of involved persons.

Wu Mu drew a sharp breath after reading it: "If we arrest people according to this list, Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital will have to close."

The list of those merely involved in illegal drug extraction—naturalized citizen doctors, nurses, pharmacists, clerks... added up to a full third of Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital's staff. And this was only those directly involved in drug leakage. If you added dereliction of duty as a charge, probably half the entire hospital couldn't escape responsibility.

Even the Ten-Person Team members planted inside the hospital were "completely wiped out." Of five informants, only one had submitted a relevant report.

If you then listed those who'd used their cadre-employee status to have doctors write false prescriptions, sporadically extracting publicly-funded medical drugs for resale to peddlers—quite a few among all Guangzhou's naturalized citizen cadres and employees would be implicated.

"I think overly harsh measures probably aren't appropriate." Wu Mu told Zheng Mingjiang. "Naturalized citizens in the health system are very difficult to train. They're all valuable assets of the Senate. My view is: except for a few masterminds, most can be reminded through conversations, have them confess and return illegal gains, rather than formally arresting and prosecuting."

Though Zheng Mingjiang was reluctant, she had to admit Wu Mu's suggestion was correct. If they truly implemented a "thorough investigation" policy, Provincial-Hong Kong General Hospital could only close. If this storm then swept to Lingao General Hospital, Joint Logistics' Army Hospital and Navy Hospital...

She didn't dare imagine the subsequent scenes—they'd be too beautiful to look at directly.

"My personal view is the 'thorough investigation' policy remains unchanged." Zheng Mingjiang weighed things carefully. "Where there are problems, investigate each one. But personnel handling will follow Political Security's opinion. Only prosecute masterminds; warn others and have them return illegal gains—that's it. Our future related actions will also follow this principle. Please inform Director Zhao for me..."

Though Political Security hadn't yet acted, Cheka's high-profile "audit" pressure was transmitted down to the endpoints as Zheng Mingjiang hoped.

At the investigation team's routine meeting in Boluo county, everyone was consolidating their intelligence and analyzing the latest case developments.

"Recently He Jun has become increasingly secretive, often going out alone. When at the shop, he's always sighing, drinking alone, becoming indifferent to business." Zheng Xiaoyu reported. "The cleanup launched in Guangzhou should already be putting pressure on this chain."

"He Jun isn't alone. We've recently observed many implicated persons throughout Huizhou becoming suspiciously active—frequent private meetings, often moving about even at midnight. And based on surveillance of pawnshops and money houses, their financial situation may not be good either."

"Not only that—internal conflicts have erupted among them, even triggering public security incidents. But they're tight-lipped about the conflict's cause."

"Also, Lushi Powder's price seems to have risen, though the price increases aren't uniform."

...

Synthesizing everyone's information, Lu Cheng judged that because Elder Zheng had taken action at the source, the previously unobstructed supply channel now had problems. Clear signs of insufficient supply and funding chain breakage had appeared.

Because the source no longer released drugs, Jubao Tang's drug supply had also encountered difficulties. Multiple instances had occurred of peddlers coming to pick up goods but getting nothing or only partial shipments. This had caused multiple conflicts—even one peddler mysteriously dying in an alley.

According to intelligence from the turned Peddler Qian, Jubao Tang's purchasing rules originally required cash on delivery. Later, as drugs became scarce, it changed to pre-ordering with deposits. Then it became full prepayment required before pickup.

Previously, goods could be picked up three to five days after payment, at most eight or nine days. Now some peddlers had waited over ten days after payment without receiving goods.

Peddlers all ran small operations, some with borrowed capital, relying on quick turnover for fast money. Now their capital was tied up at Jubao Tang with no drugs coming out. Dozens of peddlers truly couldn't wait any longer. Some went seeking explanations, but Jubao Tang wouldn't refund and couldn't promise specific delivery dates. Thus conflicts arose, with police called in to maintain order.

Fortunately, the peddlers all knew what was important, knowing they were doing shady business. They didn't reveal the drug trafficking, only claiming economic disputes—so police didn't investigate further.

But this situation didn't prompt Jubao Tang to speed up deliveries. Instead, delays worsened. By now, the longest delay was nearly twenty days.

"...The peddlers are all discussing how to handle this."

"Have you reached any conclusions?"

"Everyone has their own opinion—there's no conclusion." Peddler Qian said helplessly. "My few dozen yuan are stuck in there. Still no goods!"

After dismissing Peddler Qian, team members reported to Lu Cheng that though Jubao Tang couldn't deliver goods, they were active behind the scenes. According to their surveillance results and intelligence Yuan Shuzhi had managed to transmit from inside, Quan Youde's orders to Wanchun Quan hadn't decreased.

Without Australian drug sources, yet still ordering large quantities of "Lushi Powder"—this was strange. Without pharmaceutical factory drugs, what use was just Lushi Powder?

"I think there are two possibilities." Lu Cheng analyzed. "One is they judge the supply cutoff is temporary. To prepare for the huge quantities needed once supply resumes, they're taking precautionary measures. The second possibility is that this business is nearly finished, and they're bulk-purchasing Lushi Powder to make one last profit with fake goods."

"Too bad we can't contact Yuan Shuzhi. Otherwise, we might get more information..."

"No, contacting him isn't hard." Lu Cheng smiled. "Aren't we auditing accounts in Boluo county? Perfect—have county Tax Bureau colleagues go to the medicine market with notice saying we're randomly selecting ten shops, requiring accountants to bring ledgers for inspection. Then we can close the door and have a detailed talk with Old Yuan—ask whatever you want."

He Jun's abnormality was becoming increasingly obvious.

Zheng Xiaoyu had a clear sense that He Jun had completely lost the swagger he'd had when recruiting him. He'd become indifferent to running the shop, even starting to become lazy about "keeping up appearances" with him.

Zheng Xiaoyu decided to take the initiative and invite him drinking.

The drinking location was naturally still He Jun's villa. Upon meeting, after a few words of conversation, Zheng Xiaoyu sensed he was weighed down with worries. He deliberately said: "Elder brother, you've seemed preoccupied these days, as if something's on your mind? And those prescription forms—I've already prepared several pads..."

He Jun forced a smile: "What worries could I have? Just business not going too well." He didn't even mention the prescription forms.

Zheng Xiaoyu already basically understood. He smiled: "I see elder brother's business is quite flourishing. What's not going well? Even the Joint Clinic has plenty of patients... I see the Joint Clinic needs extra appointments every day..."

"Sigh!" He Jun heaved a heavy sigh, then had another gulp of wine, keeping his head down without speaking, as if internally struggling with something.

"Elder brother, though we're just business partners, we swore brotherhood before the gods—we're good brothers. What can't you tell your brother?"

He Jun smiled bitterly: "Some things, perhaps it's better brother doesn't know!" He sighed again. "It's not that I don't trust you! It's just that this business has now encountered enormous upheaval. Don't mention our sworn brotherhood or partnership anymore. Don't come here anymore either—you might get caught up in trouble!"

"Elder brother, stop joking. We're in the same boat. What can't be said?" Zheng Xiaoyu spared no effort making him lower his guard.

These words largely dispelled He Jun's wariness. After a moment's reflection, he said: "I won't hide it from you, brother. Do you know what I wanted those prescription forms for?"

"Of course I know." Zheng Xiaoyu smiled.

"You know?!" He Jun's face showed alarm and suspicion.

"Don't forget—I'm the health sector head here. How could I not know these tricks? It's simply using publicly-funded medical drugs, then reselling for profit."
