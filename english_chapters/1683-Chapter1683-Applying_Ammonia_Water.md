# Chapter 1683 - Applying Ammonia Water

Wanting to hear more, but afraid of causing trouble, Kong Xiaode interrupted Old Yang: "You go prepare the ammonia water first. I'll come after serving Master Chief."

Old Yang said, "Okay, I'll go right now. Do your family's first, and do mine when finished." After speaking, he called Hei Ni to leave with him. Only then did Kong Xiaode relax.

After eating, Yun Suji originally intended to find the village Tiandihui director, but hearing what people said, he already knew the work wasn't solid. Therefore, he wanted to investigate among the masses first, so he said to Old Qin [Note: Should be Kong, likely typo in source, referring to Kong Xiaode]: "After eating, I'll help you apply fertilizer."

Although Kong Xiaode said "dare not, dare not," Yun Suji shouldered the tools and went to the fields with them.

The so-called ammonia water, Yun Suji knew, was a local chemical fertilizer launched by the Tiandihui in a few areas using indigenous methods—synthetic ammonia production was very low, and it was difficult to promote it widely, so it was only implemented in a few areas with better conditions.

However, applying ammonia water was very inconvenient. The Tiandihui promoted a local method for using ammonia water in Lingao. They used oxen or donkeys, or simply had several people pull a small cart loaded with containers holding ammonia water, either jars or buckets. The containers were full of ammonia water with that stinging smell for the nose and eyes. Through a thin bamboo tube, it was connected to a hollow object shaped like a sickle with a long wooden handle. During operation, the long-handled sickle-shaped object was inserted into the soil, and the trickling ammonia water flowed into the ground. Operating in this way, to apply ammonia water to one mu of land, one had to walk countless back-and-forth trips from one end of the field to the other. It also fumigated the operator until tears streamed down their face, looking full of bitterness and deep hatred. Therefore, this job of applying ammonia water was very unpopular at first. It wasn't until everyone truly saw the effect of ammonia water that they began to accept it.

Yun Suji had been a Tiandihui agricultural technician in Lingao for several years. He knew everything in the fields and knew how to use any tool he picked up, especially ammonia water equipment. He had taught Lingao's ammonia fertilizer application hand in hand.

However, he also had some doubts: because along the way, he saw that the fields were all planted with Chinese milk vetch—this thing was originally used to fix nitrogen in the soil, so why apply nitrogen fertilizer to green manure? Arriving at the fields, he saw that it was actually winter wheat.

Kong Xiaode's family and Old Yang's family didn't have oxen. Farmers here in Hainan didn't raise horses or donkeys either. They had to get a small cart to tow the ammonia water barrel. Originally, one person towed and one person applied. With Yun Suji here, two old men pulled the cart in front, which was much easier.

Yun Suji asked while applying fertilizer, "You didn't tether a draft animal for farming?"

"Didn't want to tether one." Kong Xiaode pulled the cart while still smoking dry tobacco, puffing clouds and mist. "My family only has me and my wife. Farming is just to get enough to eat. Farming is easy here, and taxes are light. What for tethering a draft animal? Raising a small calf is more strenuous than raising a baby! Besides, what's the use of farming well? Can't leave behind a family fortune anyway, an extinct household."

Before Yun Suji spoke, Old Yang was already joking: "Old Kong, your body isn't bad aside from age. Your wife hasn't stopped menstruating yet, right? Just have another one."

"I'm a bag of old bones, seeing myself half-buried in the earth soon. In case something happens, who will raise the child!" Kong Xiaode sighed, "Don't want to think about it. Life is good now, living a few more days is a few more days."

Yun Suji thought this kind of negative emotion wasn't good, so he offered a few words of comfort.

"I actually wanted to tether a large draft animal, but I have no money. Can't afford a big ox, dare not buy a small ox." Old Yang bent his waist leaning forward, pulling the cart with force.

"Doesn't the Tiandihui have draft cattle loans?"

"Borrowing usury to buy cattle is something I dare not do," Old Yang said. "In case the ox dies, do I still want this land or not? The whole family depends on this to live. Back home, we had an ox die. One ox dying collapsed half the sky! Slowly save money to buy one."

Yun Suji said, "The draft cattle loan interest is only 1.5% annual interest, and it allows three years to pay off. Your family has two laborers, your wife can also help, and in another two years, Hei Ni can also help cut grass and herd cattle—there is grass here in all four seasons, and it doesn't cost much fodder. Still afraid of not paying it back? As for cattle diseases, the county has a veterinary station."

"From here to the county, it takes at least half a day. The doctor isn't necessarily there either—I went to that veterinary station when I was on official business. There were altogether three people, busy every day with their feet not touching the ground. By the time the line reached me, the ox would be long gone." Old Yang said, "Although my family has two laborers, we can't withstand the many corvée assignments. County, township, village, whenever, a notice comes and you have to do forced labor. Once you go, it's at least half a day. Can't even finish farming in time. Speaking of female laborers, Hei Ni also has an older sister, fifteen this year, who could count as half a laborer, but she's useless now."

"Why useless?" Yun Suji already knew from the chat that there was too much corvée labor at the grassroots level. But assigning corvée labor to a fifteen-year-old girl, what was that about?

"Once summer passed, she was taken to Lingao to attend some study class. Heard they want her to 'join the League'." Old Yang said, "Farm people don't know what joining the League is. Anyway, we just do whatever order comes from above. Isn't it that she went for more than three months? Last time I heard the village head say she won't be back until before the New Year."

Yun Suji asked again: "Isn't Chinese milk vetch planted everywhere here? Why plant wheat again?"

"Everyone wants to plant wheat. We're not used to eating rice..." Kong Xiaode stopped the cart, straightened up to punch his back, knocked off the tobacco ash, and refilled the tobacco. "Rice, that's expensive grain. But eating it doesn't keep you full. Always feels like haven't eaten."

Old Yang said: "That's right, but the village doesn't allow planting, saying wheat harvest is small. Harvested rice must all be followed by Chinese milk vetch to accumulate fertilizer." He said that now every household in the village, just like planting other miscellaneous grains, planted a little randomly on the edges and corners of the fields, letting it harvest however much, just to satisfy a craving.

"Then how come it's allowed now?"

"This is care from above. Our village is allowed to plant a little winter wheat, not exceeding five hundred mu." Old Yang said, "Whether we can eat this wheat is still hard to say."

"Why?"

"From what the village head means, this wheat is to be offered as tribute to the Senate."

Yun Suji felt uncomfortable hearing this, but it was probably the truth. Because of the flour supply issue, Senators had raised opinions about this many times long ago. Presumably, this was also arranged by the General Office—no wonder there was an ammonia water quota here, it turned out it was prepared for planting the Senate's special supply wheat!

Yun Suji chatted with the two old men while working. He not only helped the Kong family do it but also guided Old Yang and several other families. Everyone said he was "really a good crop master."

The Chief worked for a while, let the guards take turns to continue, and sat down to chat with the masses himself. After a session of ammonia application, the people applying fertilizer all sat under the old tree at the head of the field to rest, drink water, and eat dry provisions. They squatted in a circle surrounding Yun Suji, asking questions. Only Kong Xiaode still stood respectfully, not daring to speak casually. Old Yang said: "Chief Yun! You're really a good master! You must farm a lot at home, right?"

Yun Suji said: "My family originally had no land, but I've done a lot. I do all the technical guidance for the entire Lingao Tiandihui."

"No wonder you are so good at farming." Old Yang said sincerely, "We only knew there was such a way of farming after arriving in Hainan! The Chiefs are truly like immortals!"

"Not that divine," Yun Suji said. "Farming is also knowledge. There are specialized studies for this in Australian schools."

"Farming needs to be studied?"

"Why not study? Do you think Tiandihui's agricultural technicians were born knowing how to farm? Farming is complicated." Yun Suji thought a little popular science education would be good. "Take this Chinese milk vetch for example, does everyone know what it's used for?"

"I know this, this is green manure. Plow it directly in as fertilizer when plowing in spring. I see the Southern barbarians here who plant rice do this."

"It's true it's green manure, but why not just let the land go wild and grow weeds, but insist on planting grass like tending crops? Weeds can also be composted when turned under."

"This grass is probably fertile."

"You are right," Yun Suji laughed. "This Chinese milk vetch is a treasure. Where is the treasure? Everyone knows, whatever you plant in the ground grows. But if you don't fertilize, the land gets thin after a few crops, and the soil strength is gone. But this Chinese milk vetch is different. Not only does it not consume soil strength, but it also adds fertilizer to the land. That's why we want to plant Chinese milk vetch."

"Chief, you mean this Chinese milk vetch can fertilize the land?"

"Yes." Yun Suji said, "We applied ammonia water just now, it's actually the same use as Chinese milk vetch, both adding soil strength to the land."

The surrounding commoners were both surprised and convinced. A woman said: "It's still the Chief who speaks well, making it clear in a few sentences. Unlike our village head, who only knows how to shout indiscriminately and tie people up..."

Yun Suji saw that the woman speaking was the young wife who interrogated him at the village entrance when entering the village in the morning. Just as he wanted to say something, her husband scolded: "You woman, what nonsense are you babbling about? Is there a place for you to interrupt when men are talking? Is your bare butt tight after not being whipped for a few days?"

The young wife dared not make a sound. Kong Xiaode hurriedly came out to smooth things over: "Liang Zhu! Don't scold. She was just quick-tongued for a moment, the Chief won't take offense." Saying this, he bowed to Yun Suji, "Chief, isn't that right?"

Yun Suji laughed: "Yes, yes, everyone is just chatting casually."

Liang Zhu felt that this not only caused trouble but also implicated the villagers. He believed that since ancient times "officials protect officials." A smiling face from an official was even less of a good thing—who didn't know they turned hostile faster than flipping a book! If this Yun Suji went back to the village office and mentioned it, it would be terrible immediately. In anxiety, he slapped his wife and cursed: "Can't mute you! Go back and see if I don't whip your bare butt to pieces!"

Old Yang hurriedly pulled him away: "You unreasonable person! Why are you afraid of a woman babbling a few sentences! Chief Yun himself said it doesn't matter, scaring you like that!"

Liang Zhu was scolded by him and stopped making sounds. Yun Suji saw the atmosphere was a bit awkward, so he laughed: "Since ancient times, people with a little power are indeed untouchable. When I was in Australia back then, I also went to the countryside. Hearing farm workers talk about people who shake up when they get a little power, they made up a jingle."
