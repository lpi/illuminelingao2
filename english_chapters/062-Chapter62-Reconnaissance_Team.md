# Chapter 62 - Reconnaissance Team

Chapter 62 Reconnaissance Team

While consolidating the base, the Transmigrators also sent a reconnaissance team to go deep into the interior of Lingao to investigate the terrain and enemy situation.

The leader of the reconnaissance team was Bei Wei. The team members included professional scouts and geologists.

They carried light weapons and survey instruments, trekking through the mountains and forests of Lingao.

"This place is really poor." A team member sighed as he looked at the dilapidated thatched cottages in the village.

"Yes." Bei Wei nodded, "The common people here live a very hard life. They don't have enough to eat or wear."

They saw that the villagers' faces were yellow and thin, their clothes were ragged, and many children didn't even have pants to wear.

"We must change all this." Bei Wei secretly swore in his heart.

During the reconnaissance, they encountered a group of bandits.

These bandits occupied a mountain stronghold and often went down the mountain to loot passing merchants and villagers.

"Captain, should we destroy them?" A team member asked.

"Not for now." Bei Wei shook his head, "Our task is reconnaissance, not fighting. Don't alert the enemy."

They quietly bypassed the bandit stronghold and continued to move forward.

They came to a place called "Bailaren Beach".

This was a shoal on the Wenlan River with rapid water flow and dangerous terrain.

"This is a good place." The geologist said excitedly, "The drop here is large, suitable for building a hydropower station."

"Moreover," Bei Wei added, "The terrain here is dangerous, easy to defend and hard to attack. It is a natural military fortress."

They surveyed the terrain of Bailaren Beach in detail and drew a map.

"With this map, we can build a strong fortress here." Bei Wei said confidently.

On the way back, they found a strange phenomenon.

In some villages, the villagers seemed to be holding some kind of secret ritual. They gathered together, burned incense and worshipped Buddha, muttering words.

"What are they doing?" Bei Wei asked a passing villager.

"They are worshipping the 'Australian God'." The villager whispered.

"Australian God?" Bei Wei was stunned. When did they become gods?

It turned out that the "miracles" (such as cars, electric lights, guns) displayed by the Transmigrators were regarded by the ignorant villagers as the power of gods. They began to worship the Transmigrators as gods, praying for their blessing.

"This... is also a way." Bei Wei smiled bitterly. Religion is sometimes more effective than guns.

They brought this intelligence back to the base.

"Gods?" Wen Desi laughed, "Interesting. We can use this to control the people."

So, a "God Making Plan" began to brew.

The Transmigrators began to deliberately display their "divine power" in front of the villagers, such as healing the sick, predicting the weather (using meteorological instruments), setting off fireworks...

The villagers were convinced and worshipped the "Australian Gods" even more.
