# Chapter 145: Ming Dynasty Pirate Ship

This was the transmigrators' first sea battle. The captured pirate ship gave them the opportunity to glimpse the actual equipment of late-Ming Chinese pirates—who had once dominated the southern coasts with fame reaching Southeast Asia. Shortly after docking, a multi-department joint inspection team (Military, Intelligence, Industrial, Agricultural) arrived at Bopu by vehicle to examine the entire ship.

The Intelligence Group confirmed: definitely a "Guangzhou ship" type—indicating pirates from Guangdong, not Yiguan's primary Fujian territory. This strongly implicated Liu Xiang's gang.

The hull embodied Guangzhou ships' traditional strength: extremely hard wood. Initially nobody recognized it. Later, the Agricultural Group's Fa Shilu identified it as lychee wood—very hard. In 1927, the Hainan Red Army had made all-wood muzzle-loading cannons from lychee wood. Without encountering the time-transcending SKS + M43 round combination, this era's common small cannons and firearms could barely penetrate it.

The ship carried 16 cannons—difficult to classify precisely. By European standards, roughly 4–8-pounders. Casting was crude—mostly melted scrap iron. One was actually an iron-barrel wooden-structure design. Clearly, the casters knew nothing about cannon-making: casting so crude, structure so primitive—never mind bore polishing—just the countless air bubbles made the Mechanical Group's jaws drop. Using these in battle—more likely to kill yourself than enemies.

The cannons were simply mounted on wooden frames, roped through hull ports. No aiming devices; no position-adjustment mechanisms. The only way to aim: constantly repositioning the ship, getting close enough. This explained the 8+ oars—besides extra propulsion, they provided rapid positioning.

Test firing showed: with the transmigrators' refined fine-grain powder, the largest 8-pounder could launch iron balls 500m+. Higher angles meant farther—but crude construction limited powder charges. No battle shot exceeded 200m—showing pirates knew their cannon quality. Poor ammunition further reduced effective range: besides a few lead musket balls—the main projectiles were stones! Some small iron balls too. In 1840–1842, when Qing forts bombarded British ships in the Pearl River—despite "bullets raining"—stone balls couldn't damage English oak hulls.

The shipboard powder was worse. Pure powder form with excess sulfur. Test firing produced massive smoke, weak explosion. Comparatively, the powder captured in the First Anti-Siege Battle was best—clearly government arsenal quality. Gou Manor powder was slightly inferior. This pirate powder was apparently underground workshop self-made—probably sulfur-rich because nitrate was scarce.

Besides cannons, there were a dozen various matchlock muskets—some clearly Portuguese or Dutch; some local knockoffs; plus bird-guns and single-to-triple-barrel fire-tubes—probably from the Ming military. Poorly maintained—looked unreliable. Even the Mechanical Group's famously fearless weapon enthusiasts dared not test-fire them. They estimated: even the best original Portuguese or Dutch matchlocks—with good ammunition—effective range was probably under 50m.

Cold weapons were richly abundant—some never seen before. The Intelligence Department assembled various historians for identification—finally sorting this bewildering miscellany.

Most common: bamboo spears—bladed spearheads on bamboo shafts, 5–6m long. Quantities far exceeded corpses found—interrogation later revealed: besides fighting, they were also used as javelins.

Another spear type: wooden, double-ended—for close combat. The pirates' most common cold weapon: machete-style short waist-swords—only 50cm total—very sturdy blades.

The ship also had throwing plum darts, small darts, ship-grappling hooks, rake-hooks... everything. Finally: massive fishing nets and rawhide—for mounting on gunwales—blocking light projectiles, preventing boarding. These had been removed for the fishing boat disguise this time.

Incendiary weapons as common naval armament—two types were found: bamboo-tube throwing torches—oiled blocks at bamboo tips, thrown like stick grenades when lit. Also various-sized clay pots with powder, sulfur, and ignition materials—concave tops for holding charcoal fire. Used by swinging from mast ropes onto enemy decks to shatter.

"Incredibly rich." Yu Eshui—ignoring blood stains congealing and stinking—excitedly examined everything. "Just this stuff alone—I could write three or four papers. Core journals would be easy."

"You can even interrogate real 17th-century Chinese pirates. What historian could match your advantages!"

"Yes, yes." Yu Eshui didn't catch the teasing—still photographing and noting the miscellaneous scrap-iron debris.

Wu De sent Commune members to clear the corpses, scrubbing decks with seawater and sand. By evening, the ship was spotless—except for gunwale and deck bullet holes and shattered deck shelters, no battle traces remained.

Wu De, viewing the ship, felt uncomfortable. He was also navy background—now Commune Secretary! Such fishing-boat escort missions he'd done countless times in service—stolen by frigate veteran Chen Haiyang. Jealousy indeed!

Jealousy aside—duties continued. He inspected the offloaded items. The ship was nearly emptied—even sails removed (completely shredded). Commune members still crouched on deck, meticulously prying lead bullets embedded in wood with iron picks.

"We really are poor." He sighed. Lead wasn't remotely precious. Just look at ubiquitous debased Ming coins to know lead was a base metal. The Industrial Department's stinginess was necessity. Ancient mining and metallurgy—compared to the transmigrators' enormous appetite—was far too small. The planned New Army—once established—hundreds to thousands of firearms would need lead bullets...

"Chief Wu—the Navy's transferring 18 prisoners. How to handle?" Fu Youdi reported respectfully.

Fu Youdi had become a cadre again. Wu De appreciated his bullying-superiors, strict-with-subordinates style. After the East Gate Station's security crackdown ended, the perpetually anxious Fu Youdi—anxious about not becoming a leader—was appointed Labor Reform Squad Leader.

"All to labor reform. Guard strictly!" Wu De ordered. "The Security Group chiefs will interrogate anytime. Don't assign them too far."

"Yes."

The joint inspection concluded: ship construction was quite excellent. Best to repair for use—whether fishing or cargo—extremely valuable.

Damage was minor. The basic structure was intact—just too many bullet holes; waves washing in. After inspection, the ship still had utility—worth repairing.

Repair meant hauling out—a complex matter, but unavoidable for ship repair and building. Per the Navy's preference: build a dry dock immediately. The Navy proposed: at a sheltered Lingao Point cove, excavate a simple dock—40m long, 12m wide, 2.4m deep trench. Stone-walled on all sides. Water drained. Ships repaired in this waterless dock. After repair, refill water—ship sails out. Later install ship locks—also usable for new construction.

The Planning Committee rejected this. Estimated investment was too large. The Construction Group proposed a simpler alternative: a simple slipway.

Simple slipways used wooden rails and abundant lubricants for water-to-drydock transitions. Advantages: simple equipment, easy operation. Low ground-pressure requirements—for under-500-ton ships, just level ground, add gravel and ballast, roll flat. Simple structure meant easy assembly and disassembly. If relocation was needed—easily moved. Many domestic small and medium civilian shipyards used this method.
