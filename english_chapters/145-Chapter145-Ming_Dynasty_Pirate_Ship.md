# Chapter 145: Ming Dynasty Pirate Ship

This was transmigrators' first sea-battle. The captured pirate-ship gave them opportunity to glimpse late-Ming Chinese pirates'—who'd once dominated southern coasts with fame reaching Southeast Asia—actual equipment. Shortly after docking, a multi-department joint-inspection team (Military, Intelligence, Industrial, Agricultural) arrived at Bopu by vehicle to examine the entire ship.

Intelligence-Group confirmed: definitely a "Guangzhou-ship" type—indicating pirates from Guangdong, not Yiguan's primary Fujian-territory. This strongly implicated Liu Xiang's gang.

Hull embodied Guangzhou-ships' traditional-strength: extremely hard-wood. Initially nobody recognized it. Later, Agricultural-Group's Fa Shilu identified it as lychee-wood—very hard. In 1927, Hainan Red-Army had made all-wood muzzle-loading cannons from lychee-wood. Without encountering the time-transcending SKS + M43-round combination, this era's common small-cannons and firearms could barely penetrate it.

Ship carried 16 cannons—difficult to classify precisely. By European-standards, roughly 4–8-pounders. Casting was crude—mostly melted scrap-iron. One was actually iron-barrel wooden-structure. Clearly, casters knew nothing about cannon-making: casting so crude, structure so primitive—never mind bore-polishing—just the countless air-bubbles made Mechanical-Group's jaws drop. Using these in battle—more likely to kill yourself than enemies.

Cannons were simply mounted on wooden-frames, roped through hull-ports. No aiming-devices; no position-adjustment mechanisms. Only way to aim: constantly repositioning the ship, getting close enough. This explained the 8+ oars—besides extra-propulsion, they provided rapid positioning.

Test-firing showed: with transmigrators' refined fine-grain powder, the largest 8-pounder could launch iron-balls 500m+. Higher-angles meant farther—but crude construction limited powder-charges. No battle-shot exceeded 200m—showing pirates knew their cannon-quality. Poor ammunition further reduced effective-range: besides few lead musket-balls—main projectiles were stones! Some small iron-balls too. 1840–1842, when Qing forts bombarded British ships in Pearl-River—despite "bullets raining"—stone-balls couldn't damage English oak-hulls.

Shipboard-powder was worse. Pure powder-form with excess sulfur. Test-firing produced massive smoke, weak explosion. Comparatively, First-Anti-Siege captured-powder was best—clearly government-arsenal quality. Gou Manor powder was slightly-inferior. This pirate-powder was apparently underground-workshop self-made—probably sulfur-rich because nitrate-scarce.

Besides cannons, a dozen various matchlock-muskets—some clearly Portuguese or Dutch; some local-knockoffs; plus bird-guns and single-to-triple-barrel fire-tubes—probably from Ming-military. Poorly-maintained—looked unreliable. Even Mechanical-Group's famously-fearless weapon-enthusiasts dared not test-fire. They estimated: even best original Portuguese/Dutch matchlocks—with good ammunition—effective-range probably under 50m.

Cold-weapons were richly abundant—some never-seen-before. Intelligence-Department assembled various historians for identification—finally sorting this bewildering miscellany.

Most common: bamboo-spears—bladed-spearheads on bamboo-shafts, 5–6m long. Quantities far exceeded corpses found—interrogation later revealed: besides fighting, also used as javelins.

Another spear-type: wooden, double-ended—for close-combat. Pirates' most common cold-weapon: machete-style short-waist-swords—only 50cm total—very sturdy blades.

Ship also had throwing plum-darts, small-darts, ship-grappling hooks, rake-hooks... everything. Finally: massive fishing-nets and rawhide—for mounting on gunwales—blocking light-projectiles, preventing boarding. Removed for fishing-boat-disguise this time.

Incendiary-weapons as common naval-armament—two types found: bamboo-tube throwing-torches—oiled-blocks at bamboo-tips, thrown like stick-grenades when lit. Also various-sized clay-pots with powder, sulfur, and ignition-materials—concave tops for holding charcoal-fire. Used by swinging from mast-ropes onto enemy-decks to shatter.

"Incredibly rich." Yu Eshui—ignoring blood-stains congealing and stinking—excitedly examined everything. "Just this stuff alone—I could write three-four papers. Core-journals would be easy."

"You can even interrogate real 17th-century Chinese pirates. What historian could match your advantages!"

"Yes, yes." Yu Eshui didn't catch the teasing—still photographing and noting the miscellaneous scrap-iron debris.

Wu De sent Commune-members to clear corpses, scrubbing decks with seawater and sand. By evening, ship was spotless—except for gunwale-and-deck bullet-holes and shattered deck-shelters, no battle-traces remained.

Wu De, viewing the ship, felt uncomfortable. He was also navy-background—now Commune-Secretary! Such fishing-boat escort-missions he'd done countless times in service—stolen by frigate-veteran Chen Haiyang. Jealousy indeed!

Jealousy aside—duties continued. He inspected offloaded-items. Ship was nearly emptied—even sails removed (completely shredded). Commune-members still crouched on deck, meticulously prying lead-bullets embedded in wood with iron-picks.

"We really are poor." He sighed. Lead wasn't remotely precious. Just look at ubiquitous debased Ming-coins to know lead was base-metal. Industrial-Department's stinginess was necessity. Ancient mining/metallurgy—compared to transmigrators' enormous-appetite—was far too small. The planned New-Army—once established—hundreds to thousands of firearms would need lead-bullets...

"Chief Wu—Navy's transferring 18 prisoners. How to handle?" Fu Youdi reported respectfully.

Fu Youdi had become a cadre again. Wu De appreciated his bullying-superiors, strict-with-subordinates style. After East Gate Station's security-crackdown ended, the perpetually-anxious-about-not-becoming-leader Fu Youdi was appointed Labor-Reform-Squad Leader.

"All to labor-reform. Guard strictly!" Wu De ordered. "Security-Group chiefs will interrogate anytime. Don't assign them too far."

"Yes."

Joint-inspection concluded: ship-construction was quite-excellent. Best to repair for use—whether fishing or cargo—extremely valuable.

Damage was minor. Basic-structure intact—just too many bullet-holes; waves washing in. After inspection, ship still had utility—worth repairing.

Repair meant hauling-out—a complex-matter, but unavoidable for ship-repair/building. Per Navy's preference: build a dry-dock immediately. Navy proposed: at a sheltered Lingao-Point cove, excavate a simple-dock—40m-long, 12m-wide, 2.4m-deep trench. Stone-walled on all sides. Water drained. Ships repaired in this waterless-dock. After repair, refill water—ship sails out. Later install ship-locks—also usable for new-construction.

Planning-Committee rejected this. Estimated investment too large. Construction-Group proposed simpler alternative: simple-slipway.

Simple-slipways used wooden-rails and abundant-lubricants for water-to-drydock transitions. Advantages: simple equipment, easy operation. Low ground-pressure requirements—for under-500-ton ships, just level ground, add gravel/ballast, roll flat. Simple-structure meant easy assembly/disassembly. If relocation needed—easily moved. Many domestic small/medium civilian-shipyards used this method.
