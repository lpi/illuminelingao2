# Chapter 2707: The Capital (Part 59)

Liao Sanniang had already grasped some details about the enemy. The opposition had four relatively tall and sturdy men; these were her primary opponents. She didn't know the enemy's will to fight. On the battlefield, once the elite vanguard of the government troops was frustrated and annihilated, it would trigger a collapse. However, in small-scale private fights for personal gain, people were often more vicious and persistent. Often, the outcome wouldn't be decided until the balance of numbers tipped. This might mean her side had to take down fifteen people without suffering losses. That was somewhat difficult.

It was autumn, and the plants were beginning to wither. Branches still hung full of remnant leaves, but they had become brittle, making louder noises when stepped on or broken. As she advanced deeper, Liao Sanniang became more cautious, which slowed her pace even further.

The dense vegetation reduced visibility. The distance between Liao Sanniang and Little Bazi behind her had shrunk to two steps, ensuring that in case of sudden events, they could react and support each other faster.

Passing through a narrow path, Liao Sanniang turned and made a horizontal line gesture to Little Bazi.

Little Bazi understood. He took a piece of steel wire from his waist and strung it horizontally between trees at roughly a person's height. Then he took out five soot-blackened fishhooks and hung them side-by-side on the wire. From a slight distance, the matte steel wire and fishhooks were invisible to the naked eye.

Once deployed, Liao Sanniang waved her hand gently, and the two continued forward.

After moving forward a bit more, a speck of white light flashed ahead—the reflection off skin.

Liao Sanniang halted instantly and abruptly raised her left fist. Behind her, Little Bazi immediately froze in place. Soon after, an impatient male voice sounded from not far ahead: "We've been waiting here for ages. Why hasn't that bunch of bulls arrived yet?"

Immediately following, another wretched voice spoke: "You're a radish seller following a salt carrier—worrying for nothing (*salty worry*). The leaders have their own plans for these things; what's your hurry? I heard there's a woman in this group. It seems the brothers will have fun for a few days. A while back, our brothers robbed a family returning to their hometown. I dragged the three bulls to the roadside and killed them one by one with a simple saber, then played with the two women, hehehe. That little lady's body was as white as fresh goat's milk..."

Amidst the foul language, a circle of suppressed lewd laughter rang out around them.

Suddenly, someone called out in a low voice, "They're here."

The group stirred. Everyone stretched their necks and leaned out to look, their clothes rustling as they moved.

Through the trees, the crowd saw that indeed, at the bend of the road, a dozen men were escorting a mule cart, creaking slowly toward them.

Behind them, Liao Sanniang's expression was grim. She signaled to Little Bazi, and the two simultaneously moved slowly toward the trees beside them, silently merging into the shadows behind the trunks, becoming one with the deathly stillness.

Zhao Liangjian sat on the lateral branch of a half-dead scholar tree, gazing into the distance. He saw Liao Sanniang and her companion pause briefly at the road bend before disappearing into the roadside forest.

Zhao Liangjian looked up at the sky, then turned to glance at Old Feng, crouching under the tree smoking. Seeing that the cigarette in his mouth was down to a butt, he estimated the time and leaped down from the tree.

Old Feng glimpsed Zhao Liangjian jumping down and immediately snuffed out the cigarette butt on the tree trunk. He picked up the horse whip, flicked his wrist gently, and cracked a crisp explosion in the air. The group set off.

Turning the bend and proceeding a distance, Zhao Liangjian reined in his horse and clapped his hands. He released the dart dog from the formation. The dog sniffed heavily (*huchi huchi*), then barked loudly.

Zhao Liangjian let out a long call: "Vicious tiger blocking the road, everyone take care."

The escort bureau group stopped immediately. Hearing the warning, two fellows by the mule cart immediately untied the slipknots of the ropes binding the cart. With a few turns of the winches on both sides of the cart frame, they loosened the taut ropes, and the canvas covering the mule cart snapped open with a *pa*.

The guards pulled rattan shields and long-handled weapons from the gaps between the cargo boxes under the canvas. Amidst a chaotic clanging, everyone held weapons in hand, protecting the silver cart in the center and forming a defensive circle.

Zhao Liangjian's eyes suddenly fierce, he faced the main road and shouted loudly: "Turning the big road comes another bend, a vicious tiger blocks the way ahead. Brothers hold weapons in hand, thieves tremble at the sight. All brothers strike the tiger together, making roads across the Five Lakes and Four Seas peaceful."

After reciting a few lines of doggerel, Zhao Liangjian drew a thick, segmented steel whip from the sheath by his saddle. He dismounted, holding the whip horizontally, and walked to the front of the formation.

Zhao Liangjian shouted to both sides of the road: "Listen closely, men in the woods! Your tracks are exposed. If you are upright heroes standing between heaven and earth, come out and meet us. Friends of the Line need not hide head and tail."

As his voice faded, silence reigned in the woods. Only a tumbleweed was pushed by the wind, rolling across the empty road.

Seeing no sound for a long while, Zhao Liangjian continued, "If you're set on being shrinking turtles, I'll turn the cart back and report to the authorities. I'll act as a guide for the constables to come catch the highwaymen."

Waiting a moment longer, seeing still no response from around, it seemed Zhao Liangjian was talking to himself.

Zhao Liangjian yelled again: "You are inside, we are outside. How can we discuss matters? Sneaky and wretched action is not the conduct of heroes. Don't force us to loose arrows to pinpoint your location. When you can't hide and are dragged out, the Hero's face won't look good. If word spreads, the world will look down on you." Finishing, he waved the steel whip in his hand above his head.

Behind him, seeing the signal, Liu Chang leaped onto the roof of the mule cart in a single bound. He drew his eight-strength cavalry bow and released a whistling arrow with a *ri-er* sound. The whistling mechanism on the arrowhead screamed as the arrow traced a high parabola, flying dozens of paces before its momentum exhausted and it fell in the middle of the road ahead.

This time they didn't wait long. As soon as the arrow landed, a whistle sounded ahead. Over twenty men surged out of the woods a few dozen paces away, rushing in a swarm until they stopped less than twenty paces from Zhao Liangjian and the others.

Seeing the thieves shouted out, the escort bureau crowd immediately tensed up and huddled tighter.

A big man walked out from the group of thieves. He had rough skin, a face full of fleshy ridges, a cheek-covering beard, and a fat, sturdy frame. He wore a blue cloth headscarf and a dirty, bronze-studded brigandine armor that had lost its color, lacking both tassets and spaulders. He held a long saber with a five-*chi* blade and a one-*chi*-five-*cun* handle; clearly, he was the leader of the crowd.

The big man walked up close and asked somewhat puzzledly, "I thought I didn't reveal any flaws. How did you see our hiding place?"

Zhao Liangjian walked to the front and laughed. "Spirit hounds on earth track a thousand *li*, divine hawks in the sky gaze from the clouds. We have our ways."

Having said that, he raised his voice and asked clearly, "May I know the Hero's surname and great name?"

The big man snorted coldly. "Asking for names so you can arrest me later? My Lord is the Great King of the Underworld (*Yinsi*), only in charge of dead men, not sparing the living. Just call me Martial Yama (*Wu Yanluo*)."

Zhao Liangjian did not take offense. He cupped his hands and said, "There are mountains beyond mountains, and forests beyond forests. Originally, the Jianghu was one line. Little Brother was poor and took to the road; the Greenwood Jianghu became my home. The great road splits east and west; a stick of incense turns back rivers and mountains. We are escorts from the Heliansheng Escort Bureau in the Capital. Passing through your noble territory today, we hope you'll grant convenience and look after us a bit, lending half a sail of east wind to send us west. if promised, we will etch gratitude in our thoughts. Here are some meager travel expenses for the brothers to buy wine and meat. It's not much of a sentiment, just a small token of human manufacturing."

After speaking, Zhao Liangjian waved his hand. A guard handed over a silver packet of thirty taels. Zhao Liangjian took it and tossed it near Martial Yama.

Martial Yama glanced sideways at the bundle, the corners of his mouth curling in contempt. "Who is family with you! My Lord is not a drifter in the Jianghu; your bullshit rules don't govern me. My Lord doesn't know any Heliansheng, nor understand your city slang and hidden words. Grandpa doesn't cultivate good karma; my deeds are always only forceful and vicious. If there are men, kill them; if there are women, rape them; if there is wealth, seize it. Life is short, one should seek comfort and pleasure. If you fellows are sensible, leave the cart and horses and I'll let you go. Otherwise, the ditch by this road will be your grave, and today next year will be your anniversary."

The two chatted for a moment longer. Zhao Liangjian's brow gradually furrowed. This Martial Yama's attitude was stiff and tyrannical; his words revealed he was someone who didn't care about life or death. With just a few sentences, he choked off the conversation, leaving almost no room for maneuvering.

Zhao Liangjian shook his head and sighed softly. "Hero, leave some room to turn around. Everything can be discussed. Surviving in chaotic times is already hard; why fight to the death?"

Martial Yama grinned. "Room my ass. Do you take My Lord for a clueless fool? Since you're willing to throw down this much silver to buy passage, there must be a thousand times this wealth on the cart. Enough idle talk. If you don't give it, I'll make you bleed right now and finish you all off together."

Zhao Liangjian sneered. "Oh? When friends come, we eat fat meat; when vicious dogs come, they gnaw hard bones. Since you are not friends, don't regret it if you break your teeth."

Martial Yama's face turned ferocious, and he said viciously, "My Lord has copper teeth and iron jaws; I'll chew you up even if you're iron bone."

Martial Yama waved his hand. Behind him, the bandits brandished their swords and spears chaotically, shouting in unison, about to charge.

Zhao Liangjian's face was grim. He shouted loudly: "Form ranks!"

The guards immediately changed formation. The circular array shifted into a wild goose wing line. The two sides confronted each other. The escort bureau men held their weapons, shoulders touching shoulders, relying on each other to protect the front and flanks.

On top of the mule cart, Liu Chang nocked an arrow, drew the cavalry bow halfway, widened his tiger eyes, and shouted loudly: "Life and death together!"

The guards exerted all their strength, responding hoarsely: "Iron and blood we share!"

The guards pointed their weapons forward, took a synchronized step forward, stamped their feet heavily, and roared simultaneously: "Kill thieves!" Their slogan was neat, their movements uniform. After shouting, their blood surged, fighting spirit rose, and a chest full of heroism filled them; a dozen men seemed to have the spirit of a thousand troops.

The bandits were mostly local petty thieves; they only felt bold when gathering in numbers. Intimidated by the majestic imposition of Zhao Liangjian and the others, fear appeared on their faces. Their hearts quailed, their footsteps halted, and their formation became somewhat messy.

Martial Yama's face instantly turned iron-green. He took a step forward, thrust out his long saber, widened his eyes, and grinned, revealing a mouthful of jagged black and yellow rotten teeth. He chuckled quietly twice, then the laughter rose from low to high, weak to strong, becoming louder and louder, finally turning into unrestrained, boisterous laughter filled with madness and brutality.
