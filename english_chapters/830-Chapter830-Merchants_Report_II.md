# Chapter 830: Merchant's Report (II)

First, they sealed the gunpowder magazine on the ship—using a long strip of paper with words and numbers written in ink, pasted tightly on the door. To open it, one must destroy the paper strip. This paper strip seemed to have legal significance because our Chinese sailor said the strip was stamped with some seal symbolizing authority.

What surprised me most was that when they signed the sealing date, they used Arabic numerals—this was really puzzling, and they used the era of Lord Jesus' birth. Clearly, they are not ordinary Asian barbarians.

This method of sealing was also adopted when they put all our weapons: from swords to matchlocks, into the armory for sealing. For the cannons on the *Magdeburg*, they only sealed the touchholes with a special wooden plug.

The Australians did not take away our sails and rigging. Plus, their sealing behavior was completely symbolic. Compared to the Japanese practice of taking away all our weapons and gunpowder and even dismantling sails and rigging, the Australians clearly have great confidence in their own military power.

The Australians then sprayed a large amount of a liquid potion everywhere except the cargo hold—it was neither wine nor vinegar, but a turbid white liquid. We immediately knew where the strange smell on them came from; it was precisely this milky white liquid. It made our whole ship wet. It was full of a pungent smell. Some people felt dizzy and giddy after smelling it. We all had to run to the deck to avoid the toxicity of this smell.

After confirming that everything had been done according to their requirements, the officials boarded the ship again and issued us the necessary documents. According to this document, we could send people to designated locations on the wharf to purchase various daily necessities during the anchorage period. The customs officials informed us of the local tariff regulations and gave us a booklet listing the tax rate table for all import and export commodities in Lingao. Such a convenient and open practice was an eye-opener.

This is the most perfect customs tariff I have ever seen. Every import and export commodity has a specific tax rate. The tax rates for most commodities are not high. Here I have to say that among the goods we brought, the tax rate for spices is on the high side; the Australians actually levy a 24% import tax—obviously, the Australians do not like this commodity very much. The tax rates for raw timber, grain, linen, and woolens are extremely low; grain and raw timber are even tax-free.

The customs official asked me if I intended to sell all the cargo on the ship in Lingao. I said: I came to Lingao precisely for this matter. Then they unloaded the cargo on the *Magdeburg*—the cargo would be temporarily stored in the dedicated warehouse on the wharf before a deal was reached, until the transaction was completed—I raised no objection to this.

The scene of unloading cargo was magnificent! Your Excellency, everyone present expressed that this was a scene they would never forget in their lives. I have said before that they use cranes to load and unload cargo, just as we do in The Hague and Amsterdam. But their huge cranes were so flexible and powerful that we were all fascinated. Although these cranes looked like mere frames built of iron beams and wooden posts, they were very sturdy in operation.

Your Excellency surely remembers the cranes used on the wharfs in Amsterdam and other places; huge as a building, but the lifting capacity is pitifully small. Cargo that requires three strong men running with all their might in a squirrel cage to drive the crane to lift, the Australians accomplished easily using mysterious fire machines. The weight lifted at one time was ten, or even twenty times more.

The Australians use several special devices to improve the efficiency of transfer. One is like a huge fishing net. Cargo in bales: rice, spices are put into the net bag by dozens of bales, and then lifted by the crane. Another is a huge tray—they call it a pallet. It seems to be an iron frame covered with thick wooden planks. Raw timber, woolens, linen, and other boxed goods are placed on this tray and then lifted. To prevent the goods from falling due to collisions during the lifting process, a large net is bundled on top each time.

I have to admit, although this device is very simple and clear at a glance, it is meaningless to us because we do not have cranes capable of lifting such weight.

The third device is the most peculiar. I don't know how to describe it to Your Excellency. On the stone pier, there is a kind of "track," looking very similar to a ladder laid flat on the ground. Only it is made of iron. The Australians use a string of connected vehicles on it. The wheels of the vehicles are fixed on the iron bars—they can only roll along the iron bars. It is said that this allows the cars to carry very heavy loads. The cars are mostly flatbed carts without shelter on four sides. Many goods lifted from the ship were placed directly on the carts, and once a train was full, it was pulled away.

Here, I have to say the most amazing thing happened—these vehicles used neither horses nor human power. After emitting a sharp trumpet sound, they moved automatically. We had a big argument about what exactly drove the vehicles. In our view, this train weighed at least ten thousand pounds; even using horses would require many. Several soldiers and sailors swore they saw the devil pushing the cart from behind—I am skeptical about this. I believe the Australians have mastered a mysterious power. This power should be the same as the power driving the cranes; it is a kind of fire machine.

After the unloading was finished, the customs official gave us a cargo manifest. At the same time, he reminded us: all imported goods must first be selected for purchase by the Australians after paying the import tariff before we are allowed to sell them freely. We cannot trade with the local natives until the Australians have purchased what they want.

Another tax the Australians levy on us is the anchorage tax—here I have to mention their weights and measures. They use a unit of length called "meter." The Australians calculated the "tonnage" of the ship using some formula based on the length and width of our ship. This is roughly a unit of weight or volume for the Australians. The anchorage tax is collected per ton.

Overall: The Australian customs is the best customs I have ever seen. They work quickly and do not extort customary fees from us, which is common in all ports.

Here I want to mention their officials. In terms of clothing, Australian officials are hard to distinguish from ordinary people. They have the same short hair and wear identical blue, black, and natural-colored clothes. This clothing is short, tight, and narrow, somewhat similar to our fencing jackets. The clothes open down the middle and are fastened with buttons. There are generally four pockets on the jacket—this is the biggest difference between them and ordinary people. According to their regulations, this is a treatment only officials can enjoy.

I don't know what specific function the two pockets on the chest have, because the upper pocket is almost just a piece of cloth fixed on the front chest lapel. Except for holding a pen, it is completely decorative for the officials. They are all obeyed and respected by the people. They are commonly referred to as "Cadres," just like "Gentlemen" in our language.

The officials' clothing is very simple. They do not wear silk or woolens, but clothes made of cotton or linen. There are no gold or silver threads or embroidered decorations on the clothes, and the buttons are made of wood. Letting their officials dress the same as the lowliest commoners, the Australian government's thinking is indeed not something we can understand.

During the quarantine, we stayed idle on the ship. The Australians sold us a large amount of fresh food: various fruits, vegetables, and fish, but never supplied meat, eggs, and milk. The soldiers and sailors complained loudly about this—we only had salt meat on the ship, and everyone hoped to eat fresh meat. For this, we requested to purchase some pigs and cattle from the Australian officials who came to inspect, but the other party said they could not meet our needs. Only after my repeated requests did they provide us with some chickens and geese—all slaughtered.

The Australians seem to be like the Chinese, very lacking in meat. But even sailing in coastal China, as long as one takes out Spanish Reals, one can buy pigs and chickens, sometimes even cattle. During the quarantine on the ship in Lingao, we could not buy a single pig no matter how high a price we offered. Everyone was very dissatisfied with this. Fortunately, they could supply chickens and geese once a week.

In terms of alcohol supply, the Australians are very abundant. They supply a large amount of rum, enough for sailors and soldiers to bathe in. In addition, they supply a sweet and sour beer. The latter can hardly be counted as alcohol, but because it has rich foam and a cool taste, everyone loves to drink it—the Australians call it "Kvass." They put Kvass in big-bellied glass bottles, plug them with wooden corks, seal them with iron wire and wax, and soak them in seawater before taking them out to drink. It is a refreshing beverage.

Following Your Excellency's instructions, Mr. Gonzalez, Mr. Leibtrini, and I observe the condition of the port every day. The port they call "Bopu" is not very large, but because the strait it faces is very narrow, there are many anchorages suitable for mooring ships. Therefore, it can accommodate enough ships. We saw the fort at the end of the stone pier—just as the pamphlet you gave us said. This fort is very tall; it is more like a small hill than a fort. But whether there are cannons installed on it, and whether the cannons can shoot to the distance mentioned in the pamphlet, we cannot judge—that is a restricted area, and one cannot approach without a special ID. Gonzalez is skeptical about the presence of cannons on it. He believes the position of the fort is too far inland. Shooting from there, the cannonball would have to fly over a direct distance of more than one league to reach the sea. It is hard to imagine a cannon that can shoot so far.
