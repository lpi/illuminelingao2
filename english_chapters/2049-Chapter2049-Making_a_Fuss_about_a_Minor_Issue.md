# Chapter 2049 - Making a Fuss about a Minor Issue

Normally, the incident should have passed like this—neither was the soy-sauce-type Elder's personal safety threatened, nor was his itinerary delayed. But upon returning to Lingao, he wouldn't let it go. And after hearing his embellished description, the other soy-sauce-type Elders wouldn't let it go either. They demanded the Administration Council Standing Committee hold an expanded meeting to thoroughly question the Navy: Is this Navy the Council of Elders' army or some people's private army? How dare they place regulations above an Elder's safety! A battle that could clearly be avoided, yet they insisted on dragging an unrelated non-military Elder into danger just to pick a fight. Where did the principle of "Elder Supremacy" go? As the matter fermented, more and more non-soy-sauce-type Elders joined in. After all, given the Council of Elders' current setup, long-distance travel inevitably involved taking ships. And Navy ships, being armed and having high-quality personnel, had always been the first choice for Elders' travel. But if "engage upon sight" was real, wouldn't they become meat buns on the ship, with their life and death entirely decided by a naturalized captain?

The Navy argued strongly that the Navy was different from the Army; in maritime encounters, attacking was better than fleeing. This was mocked by Army Elders, especially the young Elders in the Army. They pointed out that with the Council of Elders' technological power, medium and large ships could ensure discovering the enemy first, and ship speeds were higher than the natives'. This was fundamentally different from the situation the British Navy faced in the old timeline. The Navy mechanically copying this was just to establish a pretentiousness that made the Navy look superior to the Army—like wearing white gloves, it was impure motives. The Navy then stated that an Elder on a ship represented the Council of Elders; showing cowardice upon seeing the enemy and fleeing at the mere sight of wind amounted to disregarding the face and dignity of both the Council and the Elder themselves, making it hard for naturalized citizens to trust them. But this made many Elders even angrier: What did we travel back in time to suffer for? If we lose our lives, we lose everything; what the hell does face and dignity count for?

"If you want face, go fight yourselves, Navy! What kind of heroes are you dragging us along? Using our non-military Elders' blood to dye your Navy's cap buttons red?"

The Navy's advisor, pillar, and backer Wen Desi was far away in Liangguang. Lacking strong upper-level support, the Navy found the situation increasingly unfavorable. They were losing ground in this great debate. Naturally, this was also the result of accumulated resentment from various factions against the Navy over the years. The Navy, this gold-swallowing beast, consumed countless resources. Various departments inevitably had grievances, and now was the perfect chance to seize the opportunity to make a fuss.

"During the last inspection of Shandong, some key documents were damaged due to combat while being transported back to Lingao. You know, current account books are ruined if they get wet and aren't cleaned immediately." Cheka's Yi Fan raised his hand to speak at some point—evidently, the Wudaokou crowd stood in solidarity. His tone was mild and didn't accuse the Navy like the previous speakers, but anyone with discernment could hear that his words expanded the black pot the Navy had to carry.

"Several batches of parts transported to the Hangzhou Filature were also lost on the way due to combat..." This was the Han-Supremacists from the Industrial Sector adding fuel to the fire. Honestly, these losses were negligible, just making a fuss about minor issues. They had always hoped for the Army to go north to fight the Manchus rather than the Navy going south to fight monkeys, so they naturally wouldn't miss this chance to create trouble for the Navy.

Seeing the Navy about to be pushed over by the crowd, Xiao Zishan, who had been holding his breath and concentrating, suddenly spoke.

"Everyone, quiet down a moment, can you listen to me? I've been listening to everyone's opinions, and they're all correct; these are indeed problems that urgently need solving... Why do I want to say a few words? Because the core issue concerns everyone's personal safety, which is a problem our General Office must solve. We can't have everyone working hard on business trips while worrying about losing their lives... I think we can solve this from two aspects. Can you listen and see if this works?" Seeing Xiao Zishan confidently and slowly extending two chubby fingers, the noise in the hall immediately dropped by dozens of decibels.

"Is Director Xiao going to smooth things over again?"

"Shh... listen to what he says before spraying."

"First, we must affirm the Navy's operational principles. An army brave enough and daring enough to fight is a good army." Before his voice fell, there was a wave of "Boo..." in the venue, and the sparse applause from a few Navy people seemed very awkward. However, Xiao Zishan didn't mind, took a sip of tea, spat out a tea leaf with a *fft* sound, and then slowly continued: "But, but! We must look at the principal contradiction. It's neither the Navy nor you all, but that when the Navy fights, they bring you along, right? Here, as the head of the General Office, I must first apologize to everyone. We didn't consider Elders' travel and official business trips thoroughly enough... In the past, we had few resources and heavy burdens, with the main goal of expanding operations. Many things were done expediently. Who among you sitting here doesn't do multiple jobs? Many facilities and equipment, including Navy ships, are the same—they have to fight, patrol, and transport. This was really unavoidable, and I ask for everyone's understanding."

"Director Xiao, don't take it all on yourself. We all know what conditions were like before. Complaints over the years were at most grumbling among brothers in private."

"Exactly, exactly."

"Director Xiao, go on..." Seeing his stalling tactic succeed, Xiao Zishan suppressed his feelings and put on a heartbroken look, but someone down below started causing a ruckus.

"Today's matter is different. In the future, not just business trips—maybe I'll want to take a bunch of wives and kids to Nha Trang or the Maldives for a vacation. Good lord, if you Navy insist on dragging a whole family of old and young into a life-and-death fight regardless, how can that work? I don't care about anything else—the Navy ship carrying me must listen to me. Safety first!"

Who is that? Playing the sidekick so well? Xiao Zishan quickly looked up and around—it was actually him!

"This is the second aspect I wanted to mention," Director Xiao beamed like a flower. "We need to strengthen the Elder Security Bureau. Every Elder is most precious; nothing is more important than Elder safety. We can't afford to lose a single one of you sitting here. I think we can select one or several suitable warships from the Navy as Elder-exclusive ships responsible for everyone's maritime travel."

He glanced at Wei Aiwen who was about to stand up and speak, and quickly added: "Of course, these ships will no longer belong to the Navy but be exclusively used by the General Office. This way, there are dedicated ships at sea and dedicated carriages on land. As for the sailors and soldiers on board, they will be selected from the Navy according to the General Bodyguard Bureau's standards. After selection, their establishment will be transferred to the General Bodyguard Bureau and no longer belong to the Navy. This way, it guarantees the Navy's 'engage upon sight' while greatly improving the safety and comfort of everyone's travel. Changing to a different Navy ship every trip, even if you stay in the captain's cabin, can't compare to an Elder-exclusive ship with dedicated service personnel... In the future, whether on land or sea, whether for official or private business, Elder travel will be unifiedly scheduled and responsible by Elder Salina of the Security Bureau. What does everyone think?"

Xiao Zishan's proposal received the response he expected. Just as hats of "Director Xiao is truly our intimate friend" were flying around, Cheng Dong, sure enough, spoke up after whispering with Wu De for a while, very perceptively.

"I've taken Navy warships a few times. Honestly, they are warships after all—uncomfortable. Transport ships? Too slow." Cheng Dong scanned the surroundings, seeing Elders revealing expressions of "I feel exactly the same," and continued:

"I suggest building one or two Elder-exclusive ships with appropriate armament, faster speed, and higher comfort standards, instead of directly receiving and modifying old Navy ships." He deliberately emphasized the word "old." "As for funding, I've communicated with Wu De. We can list it as an extra-budgetary expenditure for this year. Preliminary estimates show it won't affect overall fiscal safety. besides, everyone's safety is the real safety..."

"How long from design to launch for such a ship? Besides, the shipyard is already full. Your idea is distant water that can't quench present thirst." Someone saw through Cheng Dong's "empty check" at a glance.

"Why list it in the budget! It's been seven or eight years since the crossing—where act my shares and dividends? Except for showing me a slip with numbers every half year, what has your Finance Ministry done with the money..."

"Everyone's money is in dedicated accounts; we absolutely won't touch a cent! Don't you use this money when buying special supplies?" Under the transmigrators' special supply policy, various taken-for-granted "income" plans formulated at the time of crossing became the Finance Ministry's hottest potato. Transmigrators' daily spending on special goods and services wasn't large, so most of their income currently existed as paper assets. To the heavy finance people, this money saved on the books was a huge monetary bomb. But Cheng Dong dared not say this explicitly. Spending part of it to build ships now was a very good solution. "If you want to build private ships, of course, we have no power to stop everyone from spending their own money."

However, as soon as this was said, faces in the Industrial Sector lengthened. Building a ship is a long-cycle project; even a small yacht takes months. Considering Elder safety and comfort, this yacht would at least be at the level of the *Haitian*-class scout ship. This would occupy formal slipways and require specialized equipment—especially steam engines and boilers, which current production capacity couldn't meet. Let alone dozens of Elders building them; even building one or two was difficult. But saying "no" directly would draw the Navy's fire onto themselves...

"I don't care how you Finance Ministry handle it. Anyway, I've decided to use my own money to build a private yacht..."

"Right, we'll build our own. I want the same model as the *Feiyun*!"

"That's made of fiberglass; we can't build it at all!"

"Don't give us a *Xiaocang*-class to cope."

"I remember Landu's ship was very good..."

"Shh! That matter should be kept secret."

"Secret my ass, it's been years. Even the Spanish in Manila know about it, and you're keeping it secret from us? Director Xiao, don't worry. If needed in the future, we can lend our private ships for public use, what do you think?"
