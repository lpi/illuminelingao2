# Chapter 2255: Pleading for Mercy

Bi Da took the slip of paper. On top was a petition of appeal. Her level of Chinese was limited, and having received an "Australian education," she naturally couldn't understand the sour pedantic text written by a Three-Family Village scholar. She casually handed it to Zhou Da beside her—Zhou Da had studied in a private school for a few years and naturally could understand it, so he explained it thoroughly.

The content was nothing more than saying Jiang Xiaotian was a great filial son, that the Jiang family had combined four branches into one son, and specifically mentioning that Jiang's mother was widowed in her youth, was ice-pure and jade-clean, and had maintained chastity for over forty years, and so on. Bi Da frowned slightly hearing this—she didn't understand why this matter had to be brought up specifically.

Next was the various good deeds Jiang Xiaotian had done for the village. Repairing bridges and paving roads went without saying; usually, he also distributed cotton clothes in winter and herbal medicine in summer, helped support widows and orphans, and helped with coffins when people died... He could be called benevolent and charitable.

To increase the persuasive power of this document, the bottom was densely covered with over a hundred thumbprints.

Below that was a list of property: totaling seventy-eight *mu* and eight *fen* of paddy fields, thirty-five *mu* and one *fen* of mountain forest and slope land, three *mu* and six *fen* of ponds, two courtyards, and fourteen rooms. These were real estate. Following that were miscellaneous categories: gold and silver, furniture, clothing, livestock, farm tools... scrawled over more than ten pages. It was roughly the family belongings of a well-off small landlord.

Zhou Da said, "Old Lord, this Jiang family can be considered sincere. Especially this Old Lady Jiang, widowed in her youth; it wasn't easy..."

Bi Da did not speak. She put the property list aside, held the pleading petition in her hand, and asked, "Do you know where Jiang Xiaotian’s money came from?"

This question made the elder break out in sweat on his forehead immediately. He involuntarily lowered his head and trembled, "This small one... this small one does not know..."

"Do you really not know, or pretend not to know?" Bi Da pressed.

"I know! I know!" Now the old man's cold sweat had soaked his shirt. "It came from him committing robbery... committing robbery."

"You count as a sensible person," Bi Da said, tearing the petition into pieces and throwing it on the ground. "I will not haggle with you and the villagers over this matter anymore. Otherwise, I would punish you for the crime of communicating with and harboring bandits!"

"Yes, yes, the Old Lord is magnanimous. This small one was blinded by eating excrement." The old man was sweating profusely now, kowtowing vigorously, ignoring the swelling on his forehead as he banged it against the square brick floor.

"You may go," Bi Da said.

The elder could no longer care about Old Lady Jiang. As if granted a great pardon, he scrambled up, rolling and crawling, intending to run.

"Come back!"

Hearing the voice, the old man turned back with a mournful face and knelt down with a plop. "What other instructions does the Old Lord have?"

"Has your village paid the Reasonable Burden?"

"Not... not yet..."

"On your way out, go to the Finance and Taxation Section. Report the Reasonable Burden for your village and pay it before the end of the month."

"Yes, yes, this small one will do it right away!"

The old man agreed repeatedly and fled in a sorry state. Bi Da instructed Zhou Da: "Go tell the Finance and Taxation Section: after the Reasonable Burden for this village is agreed upon, they must pay double."

This handling was neither lukewarm nor hot, but it made Old Lady Jiang and her brother-in-law feel as if they had fallen into cold ice. They just kept kowtowing and begging for life.

"Don't kowtow anymore. Even if you knock out your brains, I won't spare Jiang Xiaotian’s life," Bi Da said. "Jiang Xiaotian is a filial son in the Jiang family and a benevolent man in the village, but in this Yangshan County, he is an out-and-out Fiend of Confusion! Killing people and seizing goods, his crimes are unforgivable! You go back!"

Old Lady Jiang cried into a ball, begging, "This common woman is willing to pay with her life..."

Bi Da sneered and said to the people around her, "Listen to this! What big words she has!" She stood up abruptly, pointing outside. "Open your eyes and look carefully! How many complaints accusing Jiang Xiaotian are posted on the spirit screen! Do you know how many people he has killed in these thirty years? How much wealth he has snatched! How many people's parents lost their children, how many men and women lost their spouses, how many children lost their parents! you will cover for him? How many people is your cheap life worth? Don't speak of you alone, even if the whole Jiang family came to cover it, you couldn't cover it all!"

These words landed with a thud, shocking the two into silence.

"...Jiang Xiaotian is a filial son! Hehe, you don't even think: of the money used for your food, clothing, expenses, retirement, and burial, which coin wasn't stained with blood and entangled with wrongful ghosts?! Dare you say you never knew?! You still have the face to say you were widowed in youth and your chastity moved heaven! Don't think heaven will be moved just because you stayed a widow? Bah! When you get to the Hall of Yama, there will be plenty of wrongful ghosts coming to argue with you!"

Bi Da looked at the two old people crying in a ball on the ground, feeling an indescribable disgust in her heart. "Fork them out!"

Originally, the naturalized cadres and local retained personnel on both sides, watching the two elderly people begging bitterly, had been somewhat unbearable and wanted to come out to mediate. Now, after hearing Bi Da’s words, none of them dared to speak. Hearing Bi Da’s order at this moment, they hurried to support the two out.

Bi Da sneered slightly, clipped the property list into a folder, and called over a naturalized cadre.

"Tomorrow, take a team to raid the Jiang family's property. This is the list they submitted—I estimate there are still hidden items. Dig three feet into the ground to find them all! Demolish the Jiang family residence completely. Sell the bricks, stones, wood, furniture, clothes, and other items on the spot."

"Yes." The naturalized cadre was from Hainan and was quite familiar with the Senate's methods.

Peng Shou’an, who had come over to discuss matters, was somewhat uneasy and said carefully, "Magistrate Bi, isn't this handling a bit excessive... Since ancient times, filial piety comes first among a hundred virtues. At any rate, this Jiang Xiaotian is also a filial son. Since his old mother came to atone and plead for mercy, even if his crime cannot be redeemed, he could be given a dignified end. Don't keep him locked in a wooden cage to suffer all kinds of humiliation anymore..."

While Bi Da was speaking, a sudden clamor erupted outside. The crowd burst into a shout, mixed with crying and cursing. At first, it wasn't intense, but then the shouting became louder and louder, like mountains calling and seas roaring, as if people were fighting. Bi Da frowned and asked, "What is going on?"

Before her voice fell, Zhou Da rushed in from outside, stammering, "Not... not good..."

Now all the cadres in the office became tense. Zhou Da gasped for two breaths before stammering out: "...Not good! Jiang Xiaotian’s mother and uncle had just walked out not long ago when, for some reason, they were recognized... They were surrounded and beaten! One... one moment..."

"Beaten for a moment?"

"No... no... in one moment they were gone... gone..."

"Dead?" Bi Da frowned and asked.

"Dead... and... gone..." Only then did Zhou Da calm his breathing, still in shock. "You, Elder, go out and look..."

Bi Da took a few cadres and hurried out. Just as they reached the door, they heard mournful crying and shrill laughter. They saw several shocking large pools of blood on the ground at the gate of the county government, along with some torn cloth pieces and shreds of flesh and broken bone. A few heaps of bloody internal organs—one could roughly tell they originally belonged to two people.

Peng Shou’an hurriedly covered his eyes with his sleeve, muttering, "This... this... too cruel..."

"These are..."

"These are the two elders of the Jiang family," Zhou Da said.

Now even Bi Da was shocked—she was accustomed to seeing corpses, had witnessed headhunting by aborigines in Taiwan, and had seen Fujian immigrants boiling "barbarian paste," but dismembering two living people on the spot in just a few minutes, this was the first time she had witnessed it.

"Where are the bodies?"

"Just... just left with... these..." The National Army soldiers maintaining order at the scene were new recruits from the Yao area, each stunned and dumbfounded. "In a moment..."

Bi Da looked out and saw someone in the crowd waving bloody corpse pieces. One old woman was clutching a long lock of white hair, mottled with fresh blood, waving it; a piece of scalp was still attached to the bottom...

"Collect and bury the remaining remains," Bi Da whispered, then scolded the corporal leading the scene, "Why didn't you maintain order properly!"

The corporal, however, had a look of indifference: "Too many people, really couldn't stop them—besides, why stop them? This is all retribution!" As he spoke, he suddenly shouted loudly to the commoners: "Everyone! This is the new Magistrate Bi! It is she who exterminated Sun Dabiao’s gang..."

With this shout, the commoners before the county yamen all quieted down. Hundreds of eyes instantly focused on Bi Da, making her feel somewhat uncomfortable for a moment.

Just as she was thinking of what to say, the commoners below began to cheer. Many knelt on the ground, crying and kowtowing to her: "Finally, hate is avenged and grievance washed away."

The cheers rose one wave higher than another. At first, it was crying, then the crying became smaller and lower. Many people, with tears still hanging on their faces, began to laugh heartily. It was joyous laughter, laughter dripping with satisfaction, laughter of great vengeance avenged and brows raised in exultation. Someone in the crowd shouted: "Magistrate Bi, may you have titles for ten thousand generations!", and others shouted "Magistrate Bi, may you get a good husband soon," "A hundred sons and a thousand grandsons, blessings and longevity meant to be long"... The soldiers beside her were a bit awkward, but Bi Da smiled slightly and did not speak.

Her heart surged with waves—although she was just a young woman in her twenties, when sleeping alone at midnight, she would also secretly doubt herself. Fearful that she wasn't doing enough, or doing too much, making the situation in Yangshan unmanageable. Perhaps she would fail the Senate, perhaps she would harm her subordinate naturalized citizens and the local commoners. Such anxiety would keep her awake all night. At this moment, however, she completely washed away the doubts in her heart—everything she did not only lived up to the Senate's trust but also lived up to the commoners here.

Thinking of this, her heart was once again filled with the flame of passion. Bi Da did not hurriedly use words to express her humility like many Senators or high-ranking naturalized cadres. She turned her body sideways, avoiding the ceremony and not accepting it, but held her head high, looking at the distant mountains. Thinking of those bandit leaders who had not yet been executed—she would not only catch them all and kill them one by one, but also change the heaven and earth here!
