# Chapter 400 - Fu Buer's Family

Being admired by a girl was certainly nice, but work still needed doing. After a full day's exertion, Fu Buer's field edge had accumulated large quantities of various composting materials.

Wan Lihui had ample experience with composting fermentation. He directed everyone to crush the collected miscellaneous garbage, mix it with scooped river mud, water weeds, and cut grass, then blend in a dozen buckets of waste from Fu Buer's latrine. Everything was combined together and piled up, exterior sealed with mud. As long as it was turned regularly and kept sufficiently moist, after six or seven months the compost would be ready—just in time for next spring's plowing base fertilizer application.

"Compost must maintain adequate moisture, otherwise it won't decompose properly." Wan Lihui explained technical points to Fu Xi: pile loosely when starting composting; once temperature rises, pack tightly. Also constantly check moisture content. He taught her a simple method—insert a dry wooden stick deep into the compost, wait briefly, then remove. If the stick is moist, moisture is correct; otherwise, sprinkle water to maintain humidity.

"...But not too much water either. If you see dark, foul water draining from under the compost, that means too much water."

Lingao's current rainy season meant rain every two or three days. Wan Lihui had them fetch bamboo poles and straw to build rain shelters over the compost.

The Fu household's activities became long-term village entertainment. Fu Buer himself remained skeptical about these methods but didn't dare openly question them. He just daily took his hired hands and sons to soak, till, fertilize, and repair irrigation channels in the paddies prepared for transplanting. Meanwhile, they awaited the Society's seedling delivery.

Seedling orders had been allocated based on Wan Lihui's reported planting area. That day, a wheelbarrow transport team arrived from Lingao, using the Vehicle Factory's new "Purple Lightning" all-purpose agricultural wheelbarrow. The Purple Lightning was designed by Li Chiqi and Jiang Muzhi based on Lingao road conditions, referencing various modern wheelbarrow models and their industrial capabilities. Strong off-road performance on field ridges and dirt paths, high load capacity.

The carts carried boxes of rice seedlings. Fu Buer, hearing seedlings had arrived, immediately stopped work to look. He was immediately captivated by the seedlings in shallow wooden boxes—was this the legendary rice yielding five or six hundred *jin* per *mu*?

But the quantity was far too little! He estimated these seedlings couldn't even plant 100 *mu*—at most sixty or seventy. This was too outrageous! He'd wanted to plant all his paddies, but the Society refused. He'd agreed to plant only half, yet clearly the seedlings were insufficient!

Wan Lihui was startled by Fu Buer running up and shouting excitedly in his face. Not understanding what he was saying, he could only smile and wait for Fu Xi to translate before learning his complaint.

"Not enough seedlings?" Wan Lihui thought that unlikely. He hurried over to check the seedling tray boxes. These seedlings were large-spike, non-compact varieties, robust with well-developed root systems—he understood.

"It's like this." Wan Lihui smiled. "Tell your master: more seedlings doesn't mean higher yields—just watch."

Transport team leader Jiang Muzhi delivered a letter from Ye Yuming. As expected, it instructed him to promote sparse-planting rice technology at Fu Buer's.

"What? Planting less actually yields more? What logic is that?"

Seeing Fu Buer's skeptical expression, Wan Lihui knew that until final results were visible, he wouldn't believe in "sparse planting" or any such rice cultivation technology.

Sparse rice planting meant appropriately reducing seedling numbers per *mu* during transplanting. The goal was improving field ecology, fully utilizing rice's strong tillering capacity, coordinating individual and collective growth contradictions, enhancing plant stress resistance, and increasing yields—while reducing production costs.

After adopting sparse planting, seedling requirements per *mu* dropped dramatically, saving nursery labor, seed, fertilizer, and facilities, reducing production costs. During transplanting, fewer seedlings per *mu* meant greatly reduced labor requirements—especially suitable for labor-scarce places like Ming-era Hainan. Reduced labor per *mu* freed up more agricultural time, fully utilizing Lingao's water and heat resources.

Additionally, sparse planting allowed rice to develop more ideal plant morphology during growth, forming large spikes. After heading, green leaf area was larger with better light exposure, increasing grain weight. This promoted a high-yield structure balancing spikes, grains, and weight—typically increasing production 5-10%.

Sparse rice planting was a highly technical agricultural technique with high field management requirements. So this time, not all customers used sparse planting. After discussion, Ye Yuming and others selected only Fu Buer's household as the pilot. After all, Wan Lihui, the most experienced rice-cultivation technician, was providing guidance here.

To ensure sparse planting success, Ye Yuming's letter asked him to stay longer at Fu Buer's, ensuring they mastered the technique.

"Sparse planting is good, but—" Wan Lihui looked doubtfully at Jiang Muzhi, unsure if he could accurately convey his meaning back to the Society. "This requires lots of fertilizer—farm manure alone isn't enough."

Sparse planting wasn't a cure-all, nor simply reducing seedling numbers and increasing spacing. Generally speaking: "rich fields rely on development; poor fields rely on density." For infertile, poor-quality land, appropriately increase planting density to increase effective spike numbers per *mu*. For fertile soil or heavily-fertilized fields, appropriately thin. Fu Buer's paddies generally had poor fertility. Only half the paddies had passable soil quality—with insufficient fertilizer, sparse planting would actually underperform dense planting.

"Don't worry about that." Jiang Muzhi said. "Commissioner Wu has requisitioned over ten tons of lignite from Nanbao, now at Bairren. Two boatloads of guano have arrived from Dongsha Island. Should be enough, right?"

Jiang Muzhi also shared good news: on land outside the county seat, the exploration team had discovered peat fields. Peat was suitable as both fuel and fertilizer, advantageously close to Bairren. Foreign Commerce Department was currently negotiating with the landowner, preparing to buy it for extraction.

"...The Bairren-Nanbao highway will be completely open in one week. Our Vehicle Factory is working day and night on coal-transport ox carts. Once the road opens, lignite will roll in. Not just your one or two hundred *mu*—probably enough for the whole county." Jiang Muzhi spoke enthusiastically.

"So the fertilizer factory is imminent—"

"Right, actually already started. Ye Yuming mentioned construction is underway. Should be soon."

"That's wonderful." Wan Lihui thought: if I'd known this, why did I put so much effort into composting!

"Oh, Ye Yuming asked me to pass on a message: recently there are signs of scattered bandit elements roaming the area. Patrol teams are increasing searches. Watch your personal safety—"

"Damn!" Wan Lihui cursed. "I'm here alone—not even anyone to take turns standing watch. How am I supposed to stay safe?"

"Did you bring a gun?"

"Yeah, standard issue for field personnel." Wan Lihui produced a Smith & Wesson 9mm revolver. "But only six bullets."

"Here's a box." Jiang Muzhi pulled a paper box from his pack—24-round packaging. "And this—" He extracted a bundle of paper-rolled long stick-shaped objects with pointed bamboo stakes at the bottom.

"Signal rockets."

These rockets were byproducts from Lin Shenhe's Second Weapons Design Team's work on unguided rockets. Paper-tube signal rockets used ignition launch, reaching 200 meters altitude. No parachute design—just trailing black smoke during day, firing light at night for alarm. So signal duration was short. But patrol routes passed just a few kilometers from Meiyang Village; once distress signals were spotted, help would arrive promptly. Limited use, but better than nothing.

"By the time I plant it in the ground and light it, my head will probably already be cut off. Better to use my PHS." This area was at the edge of PHS coverage. Thanks to this time-space's clean radio environment and lack of tall buildings, PHS range was somewhat longer than in modern time-space. Wan Lihui's phone sometimes connected, sometimes didn't.

Muttering, he took the rockets—a full six.

"Rainy season means easy moisture damage. Giving you extras." This actually made Wan Lihui feel worse.

Watching the transport team gradually recede along the field ridge, rain began falling again. The fields outside the village were deserted, barely any figures visible. In the distance: gray sky and mountains... Wan Lihui had never felt so alone. Heaven and earth seemed to contain only him—could those novel protagonists who crossed alone to other time-spaces really endure such loneliness? He at least had five hundred companions who understood what he was saying.

After some argument, Fu Buer despairingly followed Wan Lihui's instructions for sparse transplanting.

The sparse seedlings in the paddies immediately became the village's laughingstock. Several well-meaning clan members and relatives came to advise: farming had been passed down for thousands of years; what gave Australians the right to change things? Just because he grew well at Bairren didn't mean it would work here. Don't be deceived into losing a year's harvest! Some hinted that Australian high yields involved "sorcery."

After several days, Fu Buer's eyes were sunken. To avoid his wife's nagging again, he simply beat her immediately upon returning home—saving argument energy. Fu Xi was always smiling when delivering Wan Lihui's meals, apparently quite pleased by this.

"Why does your master always beat his wife?" Wan Lihui was puzzled by recent daily domestic disturbances.

"It's because of you." Fu Xi whispered.

"Me? I pay for all my meals."

"Haha, it's not about meals." Fu Xi laughed. "It's about farming..."

She told him all the village's recent gossip. Only then did Wan Lihui realize the situation's seriousness. Though he hadn't read many books, he knew civilization didn't always defeat ignorance—reform always faced conservative opposition. Without measures to win Fu family support, "policies dying with departure" could happen. The Society's agricultural promotion would be wasted.

To encourage the Fu family, after dinner Wan Lihui sat with them in the courtyard—fanning, drinking bitter-grass tea, chatting. Also practicing his Lingao dialect—he couldn't expect Mandarin-speaking natives everywhere.

At first everyone was restrained, not daring to talk much. After several days, finding Chief Wan quite friendly with many strange tales to share, answering any questions, gradually they became willing to talk more—except Fu Buer's wife. She still refused any interaction with Wan Lihui.

Within two or three days, Wan Lihui had thoroughly understood Fu Buer's household situation:

Overall, small landlords like Fu Buer were quite diligent managers. Small landlords who'd gradually risen from peasant backgrounds were mostly capable and thrifty, with some business sense and farming skills.

For example, he paid more attention to collecting fertilizer than typical local farmers. Wan Lihui had often seen local farmers throw waste into rivers or discard it in fields because of the smell—unimaginable to peasant-born Wan Lihui. So Fu Buer's harvests were somewhat better than average farmers—his rice yielded around 300 *jin* per *mu*.

If relying only on rice, this large household couldn't survive, let alone be the village's second-richest—number one Fu Yousan had nearly 800 *mu* and more oxen too. Fu Buer's current position came from generations of careful management.

Though Fu family lacked money, they kept four household servants—three boys, one girl. Instead of hiring hands temporarily, he used such youngsters. Household servants were one-time investments—just provide food after purchase. Though they couldn't do heavy work for years, they handled side businesses. Older ones helped in fields; younger ones raised ducks, fed pigs. The girl helped Fu Buer's wife cook for everyone. Relatively food-efficient too—more importantly, more obedient than hired hands.

His main side business was duck-raising. Locals couldn't consume so many ducks, so he'd traveled to the prefectural capital finding a poultry dealer, agreeing to quarterly purchases. Duck-raising required little feed, minimal labor, and produced eggs. Duck-selling profits weren't generous—Qiongshan County merchants showed no mercy to such "country folk"—but compared to local farmers, he had relatively flexible "cash" on hand. Occasionally lending to villagers at modest interest, but requiring land, tools, or oxen as collateral—essentially risk-free. If debtors defaulted, absorbing their land was even better. Fu Buer never leased land out. In his view: self-farming yielded over 300 *jin*; others farming yielded around 200. Even at sixty-forty owner-tenant split, he'd lose out.

Beyond that, frugality. Wan Lihui had previously only read novels about rural penny-pinching landlords—never expecting to live beside one. The Fu family only served three meals during busy harvest seasons; normally just two—one solid, one liquid. Dry rice mornings for energy to work fields; thin porridge evenings—sleeping anyway, no hunger when asleep.

Meals were completely egalitarian—whether master himself, household servants, or hired hands, all ate at one table. One-pot rice, one-pot vegetables. Rice or porridge always contained pumpkin or sweet potato. Meat, eggs, fish—never. Those were for selling. Occasionally unsaleable duck eggs were salt-mud preserved for pickled eggs—naturally so salty they were barely edible, better for helping rice go down. Only during harvest season was there meat or fish, plus one meal of sweet potato dry rice.

Wan Lihui ate separately, Fu Xi cooking for him, paying at contractual rates. The Society gave him 5 yuan daily food allowance. To Fu family and all Meiyang Village residents, Wan Lihui ate better than an emperor: every meal was pure grain rice without any filler, fish or chicken-duck meat, some vegetables. Fu Xi often made egg dishes for him. This treatment made village elders say Australians lived in such extravagance they'd surely decline. Young people who envied this were sternly educated: if they weren't ruining themselves, why would they travel so far to this backwater?

But Wan Lihui didn't feel his treatment was good. First, eating—he couldn't adjust. At the farm, they ate germinated rice—husked brown rice retaining germ, mid-level processing, coarser than commercial white rice. Already uncomfortable with that; here eating straight brown rice was even harder. Each meal's bowl of dry rice always left leftovers. Every time dishes were cleared, Wan Lihui would see Fu Buer's wife staring unblinkingly as Fu Xi carried scraps to the kitchen.

"That mean old hag!" Wan Lihui cursed. Fu Buer's wife still hadn't shown him a good face—compared to men who were sensitive to political developments, women were probably generally more oblivious in such matters.

"Hmph, her? She'd want everyone eating bran and vegetables every meal, saving all the rice." Fu Xi whispered. "She says you're a swindler who's confused the master, ruining fields and crops, purposely destroying this household to seize Fu family land. Says you're a male fox spirit, bewitching the whole family." She giggled.

"Male fox spirit?" Wan Lihui was depressed—he wasn't some pretty-faced little beauty worth anyone's interest. How'd he earn this title?

"Yes, she even fought with Sister Yijin last night, making Yijin cry." Fu Xi said mysteriously. "Know why?"
