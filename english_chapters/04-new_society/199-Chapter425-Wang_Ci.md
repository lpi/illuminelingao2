# Chapter 425 Wang Ci

Not only did he have ice blocks, but just like the monthly allowance, ice tickets were also distributed to the county yamen according to rank. However, the others in the county didn't seem to have his kind of worry. Wu Ya, who dealt with the Short Hairs the most in the county, ate and drank in the yamen every day. This old slickster was actually drinking something called Langmu Wine from the Short Hairs. Wu Ya had come to like this wine and its strange way of drinking after visiting Bairen Castle once—mixing in some fizzing sour water, then adding crushed ice. Sometimes a few mint leaves would be added too. It was said that drinking it relieved summer heat and thirst and was very comfortable. He repeatedly recommended it to Wu Mingjin, but Wu Mingjin felt this way of drinking, with water and fire mixing, ice and fire attacking each other, was against the principles of health preservation, so he politely declined.

As for the Chief Constable, it was even more outrageous. Wu Mingjin thought angrily: *who does he even work for?* The Chief Constable lived in the yamen and would practically come running whenever the Short Hairs called. He was busy as a bee doing their bidding. When the Short Hairs went to open mines in Nanbao, the Chief Constable led the yamen runners to clear the road, bustling about before and after. If they wanted paperwork done, he did paperwork. If they wanted land deeds drawn up, he drew up land deeds.

*Why weren't you this diligent in the past!* Wu Mingjin thought resentfully. From the increasingly ample food, clothing, and expenses coming out of the Chief Constable's household recently, and from his trips to the East Gate Market every "week"—this was the Short Hairs' way of reckoning time—the saying "money makes the mare go" was really true.

Wang Ci, the County Educational Director, was the most upright Confucian scholar imaginable. Wu Mingjin hadn't expected even him to seek the Short Hairs' help. Now the several hundred *mu* of school endowment land outside the West Gate had practically changed hands. He had secretly watched from the city wall several times—the appearance of the school lands had changed greatly, making him both happy and worried. He was happy that he had wanted to support Lingao's cultural atmosphere but had never been able to come up with the money. Now that the school lands had been reorganized, the county school's expenses would be covered. He was worried that, by using this tactic, the Short Hairs would inevitably insert themselves among the literati.

Wu Mingjin didn't care much about what the mud-legged common folk thought. Although he also knew sayings like "the people are more important than the ruler," "water can carry a boat but can also overturn it," and "the direction of the people's hearts," it was the attitude of the literati that he was most worried about. If the educated people who understood reason also developed a good impression of the Short Hairs, or even if a few treacherous wretches who betrayed the orthodox teachings appeared, the people's hearts would be hard to manage. Although ancient people didn't have explicit theories on "ideology," they understood the basic principles. So he had been very worried about this.

Wu Mingjin hadn't read too many historical records, but he had read things like *Zizhi Tongjian*. Generally speaking, once literate people got involved in rebellion and revolt, the harm and poison would be a hundred or a thousand times greater than a few mud-legs rising with bamboo poles.

Since ancient times, there was no shortage of examples of literate people joining banditry. It was said there were also quite a few scholars among the Fake Short Hairs—truly a disgrace to the literati! Wu Mingjin suddenly became alert—could this Educational Director Wang also be unable to resist the Short Hairs' lures? This was no small matter! Lingao was a small county, with only thirty student quotas for the whole county. If just a few *xiucai* sold themselves out...

Wu Mingjin simply dared not think further. A *xiucai* joining the bandits—it seemed this precedent hadn't been set in this dynasty. Thinking of this, he was restless and hurriedly ordered someone to go find Educational Director Wang.

Wang Ci was at this moment entering the city through the West Gate—sighing repeatedly as he walked.

He had gone to pay condolences. A student with the rank of "Attaché" had just passed away. As an educator, this was something he had to do. Fortunately, the Australians had built good roads, and this family wasn't far from the main road. Coming and going, it only took one day. In the past, he wouldn't have been able to return until the next morning.

Although the road was easy to walk, Wang Ci's mood was heavy. The deceased student was only in his early forties. When he went to pay condolences, the deceased had left behind a pitiful widow and orphans. The family's circumstances were quite dire—they had originally only made a living by running a private school and teaching a few children to read. The county's stipend silver had not been paid for many years—if there had been money and rice to supplement, perhaps he wouldn't have died.

The cultural atmosphere in Lingao was originally weak. Now another one had died. Although the quota was empty and someone would naturally pass the exam to fill it, there weren't many scholars in the county to begin with...

Generally speaking, in ancient times, those who embarked on the path of study and examination wouldn't be in dire poverty. In rural areas, one had to be at least a middle peasant or above. But once one started studying, the family lost a strong laborer. If there weren't many people in the family, or if some misfortune occurred, it was easy to fall into poverty.

Quite a few of the scholars in Lingao County were in poor economic condition. Not only were the *xiucai* poor, but the *tongsheng* who hadn't qualified for the stipend silver were even poorer. At the last county examination, many *tongsheng* were dressed in patchwork clothes, looking like beggars. Besides helping the *xiucai*, the *tongsheng* were the seedlings of the literati and also needed subsidies.

The county naturally couldn't come up with the money. The gentry's donations had been mostly used up, and having asked them too many times, Wang Ci really couldn't bring himself to ask again. It seemed they would have to wait until after the autumn harvest, when the autumn grain from the school lands came in, and the school would have more money and rice. Wang Ci thought.

Walking past the West Gate of the county town, when he saw the renovated School Land Manor, he would mutter to himself—was this step of his right or wrong?

Judging from the condition of the fields, this was the best the school lands had looked since Wang Ci came to take up his post in Lingao. Lush green seedlings, neat field ridges and irrigation channels, newly built fences in the garden plots with pumpkin flowers blooming on the vines—this beautiful rural scenery was something he had never seen in the school lands—what he had seen was only large tracts of barren land and half-dead crops.

But then looking at the road that simply extended to the West Gate, and the fortress-like house that had just been erected outside the city gate—this house had been built by the Australians for the tenants of the school lands. The house was quite well-built—it was actually a brick and tile house! Wang Ci had been inside several times. Inside there were threshing grounds, toilets, livestock sheds, and wells. All the living facilities were complete, and the layout was so reasonable and convenient to use, it was something he had never seen before. Of course, living inside were not just tenants but also laborers and such that the Australians had recruited in batches from the Mainland, who were also tilling the school lands.

Although Wang Ci couldn't see anything specifically improper, looking at this small stockade standing newly renovated less than half a *li* from the city gate, he always felt uneasy inside.

Just as he was thinking, he encountered Lu Da on the road. He saw this tenant headman of the school lands pushing a brand new wheelbarrow on the newly paved machine road, with two large wooden barrels with lids on the cart. From afar came a smell that was hard to describe—somewhat like manure but much more pungent.

Seeing Educational Director Wang approaching, Lu Da hurriedly stopped the cart and stood respectfully by the road, calling out: "Master Wang."

Wang Ci originally had nothing to say to mud-legs like this, but he wanted to find out about the Australians' activities, so he smiled and said: "Good, are you taking manure to the fields?"

"Reporting to Your Excellency, this isn't manure; it's ammonia water," Lu Da said.

"Ammonia water?"

"Yes, it's transported from Bopu. Used to fertilize the fields. It's said to be even better than manure or bean cake."

"Is that so?" Wang Ci was no longer much surprised by the Australians' novelties nowadays. Presumably this was another of their new tricks.

"How are the crops?"

"Excellent!" Lu Da's face burst into a smile. "I've been farming for decades, and I've never seen such fine crops! It's miraculous!"

Lu Da enthusiastically talked about the many new things the Australians did in farming. Some Wang Ci had heard of, others he hadn't. He listened with great interest to the various strange ideas of the Australians and their various curious gadgets, sometimes feeling curious, sometimes amazed at the grand scale of their undertakings.

Wang Ci vaguely felt that the formidable thing about the Australians was not just that they had many "clever tricks" he didn't understand, but more their execution and boldness.

Several hundred *mu* of school land—they just went ahead and renovated it. The land was turned over, and all the irrigation channels completely rebuilt. In just one month, the appearance of the school lands was completely transformed. He estimated that if the county were to do it, even with ample funds and grain and Magistrate Wu personally supervising, it couldn't be done in less than half a year. As for the road under his feet, that was something he wouldn't even dare to imagine.

Not only did they dare to do it, but they could do it. This point made Wang Ci feel sincere admiration.

"A scholar is the most useless of all!" This sentence suddenly flashed through his mind. Whether it was himself, or Magistrate Wu, or anyone in the county with an official degree—who wasn't someone who had read widely in poetry and books, with the Four Books and Five Classics memorized by heart? Why couldn't the many things that needed to be done in the county, the problems that needed to be solved, ever get done? Just the problem of the school lands had been in his hands for seven or eight years; he had thought about it over and over but had no solution. The bandits and roads in the county—Magistrate Wu had repeatedly convened the gentry to try to solve them, and they hadn't been solved either.

When the Australians came, it was like a typhoon had blown through, sweeping everything clean in an instant.

*Pioneers of a new era!* Wang Ci sighed. He already sensed that what the Australians were doing in Lingao wouldn't be limited to Lingao alone.

Wang Ci also inquired about the internal affairs of the School Land Manor. Lu Da said that currently in the school lands, children under 13 had been sent to school. Room and board were provided by the Australians. Not only did they get three meals a day, but all daily necessities like clothes, bedding, and shoes were supplied by them. The children basically could just go naked with their mouths.

"What?!" Wang Ci exclaimed in alarm. "They're running a school?"

This greatly stimulated Wang Ci's nerves. As the highest leader of the education department of Ming-dynasty Lingao County, he worried about the county school every day. And these Australians had quietly started a school—from Lu Da's tone, it seemed to be run quite well!

"Yes," Lu Da looked at him strangely. "Doesn't Your Excellency know? My two little monkeys have been attending for several months already."
