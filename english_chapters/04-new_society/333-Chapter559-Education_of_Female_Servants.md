# Chapter 559 - Education of Female Servants

After taking her position, Dong Weiwei first determined the educational objectives. This concerned the question of what exactly the Female Servant School should teach.

Everyone knew perfectly well why transmigrators urgently wanted so-called life secretaries or female servants. But there was debate over exactly what skills female servants needed. Some envisioned it as the Lingao version of "raising thin horses"—listing many requirements for sexual technique training. However, the worthies of the Female Servant Countermeasures Committee concluded: the pool of obtainable women at the current stage was very small, with limited selection room, and the overall quality of female servants was subpar. The transmigrator collective didn't have many resources to spend on training women. Therefore, these "life secretaries" were essentially domestic service staff, or as everyone called them, "female servants"—not professional concubines.

Training of life secretaries should focus on household labor. Sexual service was an incidental function. As for what bedroom techniques were needed, transmigrators could cultivate those according to their own tastes—the Female Servant School would merely provide qualified raw material.

Dong Weiwei's curriculum focused on Mandarin education as the priority, so female servants could engage in deep and effective communication with their masters, understand and satisfy their masters' various needs at any time—especially comprehending the specific meanings of many modern vocabulary terms.

Basic literacy courses were required to reach the Level C diploma standard: recognizing 500 commonly used Chinese characters, knowing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, plus simple abacus use and bookkeeping—fundamental household management abilities.

Cooking—transmigrators didn't yet have the conditions to cook independently, but the foundation could be laid in advance. Every era treated cooking as women's duty, but a girl from a family that couldn't even get enough to eat obviously wouldn't have great culinary skills. Let alone the taste differences between Ming and modern eras.

Laundry, window-washing, and cleaning—these most basic domestic tasks also had to be taught from scratch. Many female servants came from homes with dirt floors where the concept of sweeping didn't even exist. Obviously they wouldn't have skills in floor maintenance, floor waxing, toilet cleaning, or window washing either.

Things modern people considered simple were concepts that natives either completely lacked or understood differently. Even maids from wealthy households were the same. Dong Weiwei inquired about the skills these maids had mastered and found them quite different from transmigrator needs. She retrieved books and instructional videos on hotel service and domestic service courses from the Grand Library.

The Female Servant Countermeasures Committee built a small courtyard at the Female Servant School. Inside were complete sets of rooms decorated in both modern and traditional styles, plus a modern bathroom, washroom, and kitchen, specifically for the female servants' domestic training.

Daily etiquette and walking posture were all guided one by one. Most female servants came from impoverished backgrounds; even if their figures and appearances were passable, their bearing was completely absent. Due to lack of nutrition and care combined with excessive labor, their skin and hair were generally poor, with yellowish hair and dull eyes. Their movements were clumsy.

Dong Weiwei personally taught them body training classes. Every day the female servants did yoga, practiced posture, plus one hour of belly dance training. When Chairman Wen learned of this, he immediately authorized special approval to renovate a body training classroom in the school, fitted with large floor-to-ceiling mirrors and flooring, with barres installed.

Every day a long line of women walked in circles around the room following the metronome's rhythm, each balancing a half-brick on her head, followed by splits, back bends...

"Too bad we can't make synthetic fibers—can't produce bodysuits. Otherwise, wearing those and standing here, practicing splits and such... The Executive Committee is truly wise."

Xiao Bailang, who had delivered the large mirrors, was drooling at this sight. All his complaints from when he was making the mirrors vanished completely. To make these three large mirrors, he had spent two days and nights at the glass factory, complaining constantly. Now the Executive Committee's "arbitrary directives" had suddenly become "wise."

"Just have them practice bottomless! A bra and thong would be enough!" Chen Sigen said with a laugh—he had come to teach Dong Weiwei and check on how the nutritional meals he'd formulated were working.

"What bras and thongs—just strip them naked to practice!" Xiao Bailang licked his lips. "Grab that big foreign mare Salina to be the instructor, practicing together!" He sighed with regret. "These clothes now, really not inspiring."

Not only was there no leotard, but even the uniforms the female servant trainees wore couldn't inspire transmigrator fantasies.

Originally, the female servants' clothing had been a topic of great interest, with many different proposals raised in dedicated discussion threads: high-slit qipaos, miniskirt maid outfits with lacy aprons... Generally speaking, they all contained elements of sexual fantasy, bordering on lingerie. Wearing such clothes didn't prevent housework, but going out became inconvenient, and the transmigrators weren't broad-minded enough to want their female servants flashing flesh in public.

What was actually issued was the most common mass-produced pullover blue cotton schoolgirl uniform with a long skirt—the same standard uniform worn by female students at Fragrant Meadow. As a distinguishing mark, they had a calligraphy cloth tag reading "Health Care" on their chests.

The only difference in clothing from regular female students was that each female servant trainee was issued a bra. The bras were produced by the Light Industry Department's garment factory—very simple without underwire, providing only basic breast support. Bras had been made long ago, but since they weren't urgent supplies and it was unknown whether there was demand for export to Guangdong, only small quantities were produced for internal transmigrator use. This was the first time they were mass-produced and issued to native women.

Chen Sigen checked the clinic's weekly physical examination records—he needed to use this data to judge whether his meal planning was appropriate. Most female servants had varying degrees of malnutrition, plus more or less problems with excessive or insufficient micronutrient intake—all of which needed to be addressed individually.

The weather was nice, so Chen Sigen put a chair on the clinic's porch to read the data while sunbathing. Just then, Liu San and his apprentice Fu Wuben arrived. Fu Wuben was pushing a Zidian Kai bicycle loaded with two large wicker baskets, tied up tightly with rope, with straw stalks poking out through the basket gaps.

"What's this?" Chen Sigen asked curiously.

"Tonic medicine." Liu San smiled mysteriously. "All good stuff."

The unloaded baskets contained small pottery jars, at least a hundred of them. Though the lids were tightly sealed, a strong medicinal aroma still emanated.

While the Female Servant School had Chen Sigen formulate meal plans to improve nutrition, it also employed traditional Chinese medicine conditioning methods. Chang Shide had specially contributed several secret formulas for nourishing yin and improving complexion from the old army doctor in Leizhou—including Three-White Decoction. Based on Chang Shide's experience, this formula was indeed somewhat effective.

These formulas were passed to Liu San—he had been commissioned by the Female Servant Countermeasures Committee to be responsible for the female servants' physical conditioning. He often said "conditioning" as "training"—fully revealing his true nature.

Liu San quite enjoyed this assignment—proximity to the water brought first access to the moon. He could fully observe the female servants' appearances and figures up close.

After studying the old army doctor's so-called secret formulas, Liu San found them rather ordinary. Merely nourishing yin and supplementing qi—he hadn't had much interest in traditional gynecology before, but he had many reference books compiling traditional formulas at hand, and as a shareholder in Runshitang, he could access all the secret formulas stored by the medicine shop. Runshitang's specialty was precisely health-nourishing tonic pills, with an extensive collection of such secret formulas.

After several rounds of consideration, Liu San developed several tonic paste formulations targeting the different physical conditions among the current female servants. As for medicinal materials, Xiao Zishan had made clear there was no need for frugality—all expenses would be covered by the General Affairs Office's special administrative fund account.

When Runshitang received this business and learned it was for the leaders' concubines, everyone from shop owner Yang Shixiang to the managers and clerks below put forth their utmost effort, carefully selecting materials and refining the preparations. Delivered once daily, with Runshitang sending a special person. Each female servant had to consume her portion under the supervision of management personnel without fail.

Today's delivery of tonic paste was brought personally by Liu San—his purpose was the same as Chen Sigen's: to see how effective it was.

The effect was quite remarkable. Under the dual efficacy of sufficient nutrition and medicinal conditioning, even without looking at the data, one only needed to see the female servants' rosier complexions and the luster in their hair and eyes to know this effort hadn't been wasted.

Improved nutrition and physical exercise would help the female servants develop good figures, supple bodies, and healthy constitutions—both to fully satisfy transmigrators' various needs and desires, and to prepare for bearing healthy offspring.

"Spotted any you like yet?" Chen Sigen surveyed the female servants doing jump-rope exercises in the courtyard.

"Even if I did, it wouldn't matter." Liu San's interest waned when this topic came up. The tigress at home kept her fence very tight, occasionally launching preemptive strikes. Aside from sneaking a few bites during business trips to Leizhou, Liu San had been quite well-behaved.

"Oh, you brought your wife with you." Chen Sigen nodded with an expression of sudden realization.

"This is very hard to convince her of." Liu San sighed again.

"I can understand," Chen Sigen nodded. "Very difficult to change." He chuckled. "This is the advantage of being single—bitterness ends, sweetness begins."

Liu San felt even less enthusiastic. The "sexual blessings" awaiting the bachelors had a bright and splendid future. For now there was only one life secretary, but later, as long as one's body could handle it, organizing an entire Women's Army Company was possible. His tonic medicine business would probably be very prosperous—except he could only watch from the sidelines.

Back when he had a girlfriend at his side, he'd been envied by the bachelors whose only companion was their own hand, and had even felt a bit proud. Now it seemed like shackles. Liu San thought gloomily as his eyes swept over the girls; yet he also felt giving up this opportunity was too wasteful—he definitely had to fight for it. Even if she could only be a real maid for now, he had to get one home!
