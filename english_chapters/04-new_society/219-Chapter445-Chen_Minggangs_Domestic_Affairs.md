# Chapter 445 Chen Minggang's Domestic Affairs

"Master, go look quickly, the fight has already started!" Zhou Qi urged repeatedly.

Since the fight had started, there was no need to think—his little darling was suffering at his wife's cruel hands. Thinking of what the little beauty's tender skin would look like under his wife's old fists, Chen Minggang felt a wave of heartache. He raised his hand and gave Zhou Qi a slap.

Zhou Qi was completely unprepared and took the slap solidly, almost knocked to the ground. He covered his face, daring not to make a sound.

"What are you all good for? Several men couldn't stop her?"

Although Zhang was a strong fighter, Chen Minggang had deployed four or five men around the outer residence. Blocking her for a while to let Qiuhong escape should have been doable.

"It's not that we didn't block her; it's really that Fifth Master also came. We didn't dare..."

Fifth Master was Zhang's brother, working in the Fast Squad. Although Zhang Wu wasn't a squad leader, he had an elder brother working as a clerk in the Punishment Section, so his arrogance was extreme. Even the squad leader had to yield to him somewhat, let alone Zhou Qi, a hanger-on "doing public duty" without official establishment.

"Go quickly!" Chen Minggang panicked and hurriedly took his apprentice out of the teahouse.

Before they even ran out of the city, they saw a commotion at the city gate, and a large crowd approaching. Chen Minggang looked closely and couldn't help but groan inwardly. There was his principal wife Zhang, skirt tucked into her waist, hair disheveled, holding a washing mallet as thick as a child's arm. Behind her were several women of various builds, each holding strictly sticks or feather dusters, all looking like fiends—simply more majestic than the Magistrate holding court.

In the middle of the crowd, dragged along staggering by several sturdy women, was precisely his "little sweetheart" Qiuhong. The little beauty's face was covered in black soot; probably from being dragged after falling, the skin on her face was broken. Dust and blood mixed into a messy blotch, and her hair was torn into disarray. She was barefoot—because Qiuhong was a prostitute, her feet were bound. A woman with bound feet could hardly walk without shoes, let alone being dragged along.

Chen Minggang saw this and felt pain in his heart. He almost exploded immediately, wanting to rush up and slap his wife several times. But outside the crowd, his younger brother-in-law Zhang Wu was leading several "public duty" hangers-on, obviously protecting his sister. Seeing this scene, the idlers in the county all came out to watch and jeer.

Chen Minggang hated this secretly. This kind of thing was simply making a fool of him in public! If it blew up, would it do their family any good? But Chen Minggang knew this brother-in-law of his was a fool just like his wife; talking to him was casting pearls before swine. Going up now would only stalemate the situation and provoke more jokes without any use.

He suppressed his anger, turned back to the street corner, and ordered Zhou Qi to go to the county yamen to find the head of the Fast Squad to disperse the crowd. He himself ran directly to his elder brother-in-law Zhang Shi's house to question today's events.

Unexpectedly, this elder brother-in-law was also very "unreasonable"—he had tolerated his brother-in-law's womanizing for a long time. Although he felt his younger brother and sister had gone too far this time, holding the idea of embarrassing his brother-in-law, he not only didn't help but also made sarcastic remarks: "My brother and sister did go a bit overboard in this matter. But Brother-in-law, you should also think about whether your own footing is firm in this matter?"

"A real man has three wives and four concubines. Even if I take a concubine, what does it count for? What do you mean footing isn't firm?" Chen Minggang said angrily.

"Let me advise you with a sentence, Brother-in-law. You are also over fifty. Spend more thought on official business and leave some remaining shade for your descendants. Cultivate my nephews well so they can fill your vacancy later. Less fooling around with rotten whores all day! Be careful of getting syphilis!"

This family indeed had stiff necks, angering Chen Minggang to the point of vomiting blood. Knowing arguing was useless, he sneered:

"In this Lingao County, it's always your family's logic. But with your sister making such a scene, how can I stand my ground before the Magistrate and Private Secretary? How will the gentry and commoners of the county view me? Slapping my own face isn't enough; she has to do it for outsiders to see. If I lose face, doesn't your family lose face? Don't your nephews lose face?" He pointed at his own nose. "For us serving in the yamen, face comes first. Now being made a fool of in public, how can I do business out there in the future?"

These words had some awakening effect. Zhang Shi pondered; making such a scene was indeed undignified. He had to take his wife out to clean up the mess. Chen Minggang thought that returning home would mean another round of quarreling, and going to Qiuhong's place would inevitably involve a tearful complaint, so he simply went to sleep at the county yamen. He just wondered secretly: keeping Qiuhong outside the city was done very secretly; how did it leak out?

Zhou Qi and the several fellows assigned outside Qiuhong's house were all claws and teeth he was used to using, very reliable. Not only were their lips tight, but they handled things reliably. Although Zhang Wu muddled along in the Fast Squad, his understanding of worldly affairs was just like his sister's—a rash fool's temper. The Fast Squad head Fu He didn't look after him, only letting him do evil in the county for the sake of face, never calling him for cases. Zhang Wu had no popularity in the Fast Squad either; only a few "public duty" idlers flattered him.

Fu He and his subordinates would absolutely not offend Chen Minggang for a Zhang Wu by helping act as spies on Qiuhong. Even if they knew, they wouldn't tell him—there was no need.

He called Zhou Qi over and questioned him in detail about the situation in recent days. Zhou Qi was called an apprentice but was actually over thirty. He had followed Chen Minggang for over a dozen years. Chen Minggang was extremely fond of women, and it was rare that Zhou Qi never looked sideways, never casting eyes on his master's women, so he was always highly regarded.

Zhou Qi reported that they took turns patrolling outside disguised as stall vendors and didn't see any suspicious characters coming or asking around. He also called the old couple living with Qiuhong for questioning—this couple were servants serving Qiuhong but also had the responsibility of supervision and guarding.

The old couple had been beaten bloody. Coming in, they first cried and complained, revealing nothing useful. Chen Minggang had to take out some silver and tell them to clean up first and take care of Qiuhong to recover well; he would visit her tomorrow.

Although it was a muddled case, Chen Minggang's anger didn't subside. He immediately sent people to secretly detain the few idlers surrounding Zhang Wu, locking them in a countryside house for interrogation by torture: who exactly passed the news to Zhang Wu's ears?

Although Chen Minggang was a Revenue Section clerk, he had quite some skill in tormenting people. He tortured the idlers half to death, and they confessed immediately.

It turned out the news was heard when Zhang Wu went to drink tea at East Gate Market the day before yesterday, rumored vividly. Zhang Wu immediately sent people to investigate. Seeing Zhou Qi and other Chen Minggang confidants active nearby, he believed it seventy or eighty percent, leading to today's drama of the Amazon warriors making a scene.

The news came from East Gate Market—this surprised Chen Minggang somewhat. But on second thought, it was reasonable. Now business in the county town lacked vitality; many people shifted their consumption to East Gate Market. Speaking of places with well-informed news, that was the place.

"What did Zhang Wu go to East Gate Market for?" Chen Minggang pressed.

"Heard, heard," the battered idler said, "that there are many merchants in East Gate Market, but they never pay customary fees. Fifth Master Zhang felt this couldn't break the rules and left the brothers with no money to spend, so he went to check the situation..."

Chen Minggang thought, *This Zhang Wu really wants money over life! are the Australians easy to deal with? He really dares to reach into a pot of oil to fish for money! Looks like I need to draw a clear line with him in time. If the Australians explode, I might be implicated in extermination!* Thinking of the Gou brothers' fate, he couldn't help but shiver. He began to have great doubts about his plan to use the Australians.

When this farce occurred in the county, the observation post on the watchtower outside the West Gate saw it clearly. He was a native, but the Transmigrators had taught him to record every important event seen daily in a log.

After his shift, this log was sent to the intelligence department for analysis. Zhou Botao received this report, and a smile appeared at the corner of his mouth.

Zhou Botao was a veteran. Because his childhood dream was to be a great detective, he worked as an assistant police officer for a few years after discharge. Later, seeing no future, he switched to an investigation company—so-called investigation companies were private detectives.

However, private detective work had nothing to do with criminal investigation. His main task was asking around for news and taking sneak photos. After a few years, he actually learned some tricks. Participating in the transmigration was completely an accident—he was commissioned by Chang Shide's wife to catch this strictly-acting "philanderer" in the act. Later, discovering that Chang Shide was participating in some "Transmigration Company," he joined too.

Arriving in the New World, with his veteran status, he was originally supposed to be grabbed for the New Army as an officer. But Zhou Botao had no interest in soldiering games and volunteered for the Public Security Team. After system adjustment, he became the head of the Political Security Bureau's Action Division.

Of course, the news of where Qiuhong lived was released by Zhou Botao's instructions to his subordinates. His Action Division had already developed a dozen plainclothes agents; spreading news was a major task of the Action Division. When necessary, they could also execute kidnapping and arrest missions.

This instruction came directly from Ran Yao. Ran Yao's meaning was clear: since the next step was to deal with Chen Minggang, and this person had many black materials, they might as well release one first to mess up his formation. The Security Bureau knew Chen Minggang's domestic affairs clearly. Sure enough, as soon as the news came out, chaos ensued.

"Old boy Chen Minggang has a fire in his backyard; wonder if he'll panic completely." Zhou Botao muttered to himself, reporting the situation directly to Ran Yao.

"Should we add another handful of fire? Make it burn hotter," he requested instructions.

"Are there more black materials to use?"
