# Chapter 482 - Autumn Levy (Part 33)

In the past, Huang Binkun wouldn't have hesitated to give such a clueless underling a few slaps across the face, to teach him which way the doors of Huang Family Stronghold opened. But lately Huang Binkun had been rather spooked. The Australians' strange arts had plunged him into a state of constant anxiety. Now when he and Li Xiaopeng spoke, they did so in whispers. This had displeased Instructor Wang at the County Academy, who had scolded them yesterday: "Skulking about!"

What worried him most was his meeting with Gou Chengxuan—at the County Academy, he saw Lai Xiao nearly every day, working diligently while periodically receiving knuckle-raps on the head.

Every time he thought about how Fu He's private conversation with those three fall-guys at the teahouse had been recorded and played back by the Australians, Huang Binkun feared that his own conversation with Gou Chengxuan might also be known to them.

But seeing Lai Xiao still alive and well, not having been sent to Nanbo to sift sand, suggested that matter probably hadn't been exposed yet. Besides, he hadn't actually discussed any schemes with Gou Chengxuan at the time. Of course, the plan to join forces with Gou Chengxuan would have to be put on hold for now—the timing wasn't right.

Huang Binkun wandered the county preoccupied with these thoughts. Only with difficulty did he find a wife of an acquainted clerk in the city. The woman nervously told him: most of the yamen runners and clerks had been taken away by the Australians recently. Not only that, but their families had been taken as well.

"...It was all done secretly at night, house by house, arresting people—men and women, old and young, not one spared..." The woman was still shaken. "Who knows what methods they used—silently, strings of people were led away."

"Where were they taken?"

"Who knows? Perhaps to the labor education camp. Fortunately, my husband has always treated people decently..." The woman began rambling on and on.

Huang Binkun patiently listened to her tale, then hurried to inquire about the changes at the yamen.

From her, he learned the general personnel changes. The woman made clear that many outsiders had been brought in to fill positions at the yamen—quite unusual, since clerks were typically connected by blood or marriage.

This only confirmed Huang Binkun's suspicions: the Baldies were directly placing their own people in the county yamen! These people had some nerve! However, he himself had no way to do anything about it—if the officials didn't care, what could a mere *xiucai* like himself do?

While Huang Binkun fretted in secret, the gentry and major households were privately celebrating, almost ready to break out the wine. Even setting aside the grain collection and land surveying business this year, having the Australians sweep away all those clerks who had tyrannized and extorted them—regardless of what the Australians actually intended—was clearly a good deed.

But the joy didn't last long. Soon, Liu Dalin received an "Administrative Appeal Response." This novel term was one none of them had heard before. Opening it, they found a vernacular reply to the grain households' petition.

Regarding the three demands raised in the petition, the response clearly answered each point:

On the first point—to cease "land surveying"—the response stated: clearing land measurements was a reasonable and fair basis for grain levy collection. In the past, "Household Clerks" and "grain runners" had colluded in corruption, privately altering tax registers, which both harassed and harmed the people. If grain households were all law-abiding citizens, they had nothing to fear from this "measure benefiting both the nation and the people."

"So land surveying is still going ahead?" Several relatives staying at the Liu residence were greatly alarmed.

Liu Dalin gestured for them to be silent and continued reading.

The petition's second point had demanded the abolition of grain tax "contracting," requesting a "return to old customs." The response said that grain contracting was inherently an abuse. Accordingly, the county had now permanently prohibited "contract households" and "grain runners," replacing them with a specialized agency—the "Grain Collection Bureau"—to handle these matters.

The final point was "severely punishing the villains." This needed little elaboration—Chen Minggang had already been stripped of his Household Clerk position. Not only that, but he and his entire family had vanished without a trace. The response nevertheless acknowledged "poor personnel choices" and stated that matters had been "seriously dealt with."

The document was handwritten in quite good calligraphy—probably by some literate person. Everyone in the county knew the Australians' brush-writing was atrociously bad.

Liu Dalin fell into deep thought. Though the response was written entirely in simplified characters and vernacular, these flaws couldn't overshadow its virtues. The entire document contained not a single wasted or empty phrase. Every point raised in the petition received a specific reply—nothing evaded, nothing covered up. Agreement or disagreement was clearly explained. This attitude of handling affairs was truly remarkable!

Though Liu Dalin had never held office, he had witnessed plenty of official practices. In the Great Ming bureaucracy, such petitions might receive replies, but they would either be outright rejections or strings of empty platitudes. Even for urgent matters, officials would only prevaricate. If they absolutely couldn't avoid the issue, they would put on official airs to intimidate people. If the petitioners were gentry or similar personages, some yamen secretary or aide might emerge to offer meaningless placating words. If they were ordinary commoners, they'd receive a thrashing from the runners—and might even face charges.

The Australians' administration was a hundred times superior to the Great Ming's! Liu Dalin thought to himself, then immediately felt uneasy about having such a thought. He suppressed his inner turmoil and looked toward his relatives.

"Land surveying is still happening?! What shall we do?" Someone was panicking.

"Nothing to be done." Liu Dalin had lost much of his interest in the matter. "The Australians are determined to proceed." He said slowly. "In principle, what they say isn't wrong. The current grain levy system is truly riddled with abuses, causing the people no small harm."

"Your Lordship! We who have long lived in the countryside naturally understand the abuses within. But if they thoroughly survey the land, what livelihood will we have left?"

Liu Dalin felt some distaste for this relative—at least he had a *jinshi* kinsman under whose name he could register land to evade taxes. What of the common people without power or influence? Hadn't they managed to survive somehow? Liu Dalin was after all a great Confucian who understood principles. He knew that the corruption of grain levies was largely due to the gentry's abuse of their tax-exempt privileges.

If the Australians could truly clarify the county's land situation and achieve more equitable taxation, the common folk might finally catch a breath.

He was still pondering when a doorman came to announce: Huang Binkun had come to call.

"Please show him in." Huang Binkun was one of those who had co-signed the petition. Now that a response had arrived, he naturally needed to be informed—as did the others who had signed. This task could be delegated to Huang Binkun.

"...Uncle! Surveying and clarifying land and taxes is something even the court doesn't dare undertake lightly—it may be a measure benefiting the nation and people, but the imperial grace and blessings never reach the common folk!" Huang Binkun said urgently after hearing Liu Dalin's thoughts.

"That's precisely my concern as well." Liu Dalin knew Huang Binkun spoke truly. When he read, he had vaguely sensed that whenever dynasties throughout history tried to reform some abuse or do something for the people, the reforms always seemed to make things worse.

"Even if the Australians truly intend to serve the people," Huang Binkun urged, "land surveying and tax clarification are matters of enormous complexity. In the past, Chen Minggang used this very pretext to harm the people, causing no small suffering. Now that we've finally rid ourselves of Chen Minggang, if surveying continues without him, who's to say there won't be some Li Minggang or Wang Minggang to take his place?"

Liu Dalin nodded, knowing Huang Binkun was right. However good the intentions from above, they couldn't withstand those below who handled implementation—good deeds became bad ones. Could the Australians escape this pattern? He had no confidence.

"Very well. I'll go speak to the Australians again. This land surveying business should be postponed."

"Uncle, you are truly a benefactor to all the gentry and common people of the county." Huang Binkun hastily placed a tall hat on him.

"Originally I had no wish to involve myself in such matters." Liu Dalin sighed. "But since this concerns the people's livelihoods, I must once again venture into the fray."

Since the Australians intended to remain in Lingao for some years, their conduct suggested they would inevitably have to govern the people. For the sake of his native land, he would "educate" the Australians somewhat in the principles of governance, lest they make similar mistakes.

He ordered someone to submit a calling card at the East Gate Market management office, requesting a meeting with Xiong Buyou.

Xiong Buyou, however, wasn't at the East Gate Market office. As Director of the County Station Office, he was stationed in the county seat and went to the yamen almost daily—the takeover work had entered its detailed phase, requiring comprehensive inventory and cleanup of the yamen. Much was to be done. When he received a phone call saying the *jinshi* Liu wished to see him, he knew it was probably lobbying to "exempt the land survey"—what landlords feared most. This old fellow really was stubborn. Worthy of being a spokesman for the landlord class.

Having Liu come to the County Station Office wouldn't be appropriate—the place was too chaotic for receiving guests. Better to pay him a visit.

"...Chief Xiong—" Liu Dalin used the common form of address for Australians.

"Please, just call me Xiong Buyou." Xiong Buyou carefully studied this *jinshi* whom everyone—whether local natives or the Executive Committee—considered a treasure. He noticed that while Liu's figure was somewhat frail, his eyes were remarkably keen.

"This student has come today regarding the land survey matter."

*Here it comes*, Xiong Buyou thought. *Let's see what you have to say.*

"The land survey disturbs the people excessively. I plead with you to rescind your decision. The people of Lingao will be eternally grateful!"

Right from the start, he was speaking on behalf of all Lingao's people. Xiong Buyou felt somewhat annoyed. He countered: "Land surveying is to clarify tax burdens and equalize the people's obligations. How does this constitute disturbing the people?"

"Since your distinguished company has come to Lingao, professing to protect the territory and keep the peace, surely you understand: protecting territory is easy, but keeping peace is the hardest thing in the world." Liu Dalin assumed a lecturing posture. "Your forces—with your firearms, cannon, and iron ships—are unmatched in three hundred years. But nurturing the people is not a matter of a single day."

The moment Xiong Buyou heard this, he felt annoyed. But as the officer responsible for external liaison—essentially a diplomat—he had to maintain some composure. He merely adopted an expression of attentive listening.
