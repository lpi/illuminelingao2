# Chapter 493 - Iron Birds and Thousand-Li Eyes

"Fine, since that's the case, the truth will naturally be revealed in three days." Wang Ruixiang didn't know where Fu Yousan's hidden fields were yet, but he was confident. "You can go."

"Thank you, Chief." Fu Yizhuang led his people away in a wretched state.

"As for you households, you have merit for exposing others," Wang Ruixiang said carelessly. "I'll give you a chance to declare again."

"Thank you, Chief!" "The Chief is wise!" "The Chief's great kindness..."

"Alright, cut the crap," Wang Ruixiang said. "But it's not over that simply." He then announced the punishment plan.

Every household keen on concealing land had to bear the relocation costs for one immigrant household, including building their house, breaking ground, and three years of rations.

The people kneeling below looked ashen, showing no joy at receiving exemption.

This burden was quite heavy. Adding taxes, these large farming households wouldn't accumulate any wealth for three years. Just enough to get by. But if the punishment wasn't severe, it wouldn't act as a deterrent. Wang Ruixiang even felt this punishment was a bit light.

"Well? Think the burden is too heavy?" Wang Ruixiang said. "Then forget it..."

"No, no, we will never forget the Chief's great kindness," an old man kneeling in front reacted quickly. Choosing the lesser of two evils—no matter how heavy the loss, it was just suffering for three years. Losing the land would be a huge loss!

"Gratitude is nonexistent; you're probably all hating me to death." Wang Ruixiang spat in front of him, scaring the old man into a shiver, unable to even utter a denial.

After the meeting dispersed, the village fell into two distinct atmospheres. Ordinary families treated the sorry state of the large households who concealed land as mealtime gossip, with quite a bit of schadenfreude. The punished households fell into fear. Wang Ruixiang's performance today terrified them. These families dared not light lamps, discussing in hushed tones in the dark.

Fu Yousan's house fell into a deathly silence after Fu Yousan let out a few roars and wails as Fu Yizhuang was beaten and ran around the floor. No one in the Fu family dared to provoke the family demon, but this demon currently had no other recourse besides throwing tantrums. He firmly believed the Australians couldn't find his land, but the Australians evidently firmly believed he had hidden land. So even if they couldn't find it, they would definitely punish his family severely to make an example. This terrifying prospect made Fu Yousan restless.

Fu Yizhuang gathered his courage to suggest that it was better to declare honestly. Going to beg for mercy right now would at most mean bearing the cost of three years' rations for an outsider household. The result was several bumps on his head from the beating. Fu Yousan refused to take this loss; he always felt the Australians were people of unknown origin, not legitimate government officials.

His son tried several times to point out that bandits weren't legitimate officials either, yet they extorted money and grain just the same... Of course, these truths earned him several more strikes of the stick. He had to fall silent.

"Bandits want some money and grain, but they wouldn't want our land!" Fu Yousan's eyes were red. "These hairless thieves! Hmph, let's see how they find it!" He paced around the main hall. "Go report to the officials!"

Fu Yizhuang and Fu Sanzhuang, standing below, dropped their jaws. Report to the officials? Had the old man lost his mind? Who didn't know that the Australians were effectively the government in Lingao now? Even Old Master Wu was polite when he saw them. Going to report to the officials was just asking for a beating.

"Who said report to the county yamen!" Fu Yousan said viciously. "Go to the prefectural yamen to report! These bandits! Sanzhuang, pack up, take two taels of silver and ten days of dry rations. Leave tomorrow and beat the drum to file a complaint at the prefectural yamen!"

These two brothers had been oppressed by their father for a long time and were scared witless. Although they knew their father was taking things for granted and making wild plans again, they didn't dare refute him to his face. The two quietly withdrew.

Fu Sanzhuang complained: "Big Brother, what should we do? Really go to Qiongzhou Prefecture?"

"Taking two taels of silver to report to the officials—do you think officials are living Bodhisattvas?" Fu Yizhuang knew his father's character: fond of being the boss but bad at handling affairs. He had to make decisions on everything big or small, but always sent others to do the work. As for seeing officials—he didn't even dare see a petty clerk. If the family didn't do things to his liking, he would lose his temper and beat people.

"Besides, if government troops come to suppress, providing provisions and pay will bankrupt our family!" Fu Sanzhuang also felt his father was becoming increasingly senile. People couldn't dodge such things fast enough, yet he wanted to stick himself to it.

Fu Yizhuang nodded: "Our family has no friendship with the officials. How could Father think of reporting to them? Truly senile!"

"But Father ordered it." Fu Sanzhuang didn't have the guts to openly rebel.

"Find a place to hide first. Come back in a few days and say it's done." Fu Yizhuang was more resourceful. "He doesn't have the guts to ask at the prefectural yamen anyway."

The next day, Wang Ruixiang wheeled the "drone" out of the tent. This "treasure" was properly loaded in a special box converted from a container, enjoying "Special Class 1 Equipment" treatment.

Wang Ruixiang and Jiang Hongjun carefully removed the seal and lifted the big guy out.

Except for the fragile parts, the plane had been fully assembled in Bairun City and fixed on a specially made rack. Now it only needed the wings attached to take off. Because the terrain here was relatively flat and there was free labor to level a runway, Wang Ruixiang decided not to use the immature catapult takeoff but to let it take off by taxiing.

The natives of the work team had only heard that the Australians had "iron birds" that could fly, but hadn't seen the real thing. Seeing this blue and white object being carried out, they all swarmed over.

This thing was too beautiful! The streamlined shape and smooth, bright appearance of the model plane left this impression on everyone who saw it. But could this thing really fly?

In everyone's impression, things that could fly were kites and Kongming lanterns, but those were made of light and thin materials. For such a heavy-looking monster to fly, everyone felt skeptical—but thinking that Australians could make big iron ships float on water, making this fly probably wasn't difficult.

The scene of this "iron bird" soaring into the sky caused a sensation in the camp—most native personnel had never seen such a thing. Many involuntarily ran after the plane, shouting as they ran, all extremely excited.

Wang Ruixiang climbed the tower with his equipment to operate it from above. His gear included the plane remote control, a monitor, and many other devices. The model plane was equipped with a video camera and a still camera. The images captured by the video camera were transmitted in real-time to the small monitor in front of Wang Ruixiang. Looking down at the ground from the air, many details unobservable from the ground could be seen very clearly. That was why Wang Ruixiang had such confidence in using the model plane to survey land.

Wang Ruixiang designed a zigzag flight path centered on the camp. In addition to real-time video, the digital camera on the plane took a picture every ten seconds for post-analysis to discover situations not found during real-time monitoring.

After two sorties, Wang Ruixiang discovered unregistered fields and a housing settlement not on the map in a hilly col five kilometers south of Meiyang Village. From the captured images, this settlement had over twenty rooms. The main buildings were brick and tile structures—a very complete farmstead.

"Really well hidden." Wang Ruixiang carefully studied the recorded video and photos. The location of this farmstead was chosen very cleverly. There was only one entrance and exit, and the road was almost invisible from the ground. Without aerial reconnaissance, it would have been truly hard to find.

"Planes are just useful." Jiang Hongjun praised. He was responsible for the maintenance of this drone. This "only child" had no replacement yet; transmigrators had to extend its service life as much as possible.

"Surveying and land investigation are a piece of cake. The real stuff will be seen when fighting." Wang Ruixiang kept thinking about military applications. "Pity it's a model plane after all. Even if it could carry bombs, they'd be firecracker-level."

Saying this, he called Huang Ande over. Huang Ande had graduated first in the recruit camp, immediately entered the NCO training class to become a corporal, and was now a sergeant.

"Take ten soldiers immediately and go here to catch people." Wang Ruixiang sketched the approximate location of the farmstead on the map. "Although the road is hard to find, you must move fast."

"Yes!" Huang Ande snapped to attention.

"Escort the people back after catching them. Leave five men at the farmstead to guard the property and grain—put on seals and wait for the Planning Committee to take over."

Huang Ande quickly completed the mission. Three hours later, Fu Erzhuang, along with the farmstead's long-term laborers, household servants, and their families, were roped together and escorted back.

They were marched through the village streets, heading directly for the gate of Fu Yousan's house. Seeing Fu Erzhuang, who had been missing for days, brought back by the Australians, the villagers all came out to watch the commotion, following the procession to Fu Yousan's door.

Hearing the noise outside, Fu Yizhuang hurried out. Seeing his second brother captured and brought back, his heart sank, unable to say a word. Only one thought remained: "It's over!"

"Alright, your brother is back." Wang Ruixiang pointed at Fu Erzhuang. "He definitely didn't go to his wife's maiden home."

Fu Yizhuang's face alternated between green and red; he didn't know what to do. The surrounding villagers already realized what was happening and whispered to each other.

"Not counting your brother, the farmstead has eleven men and women, two cows, twenty rooms, a well, and grain and cloth in the warehouse. This farmstead is really nice." Wang Ruixiang smiled. "Since you insist it's not your family's, we'll accept it with a smile. Do you have anything to say?"

Fu Yizhuang sighed mournfully and hung his head.
