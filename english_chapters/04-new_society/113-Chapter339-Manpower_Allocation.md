# Chapter 339 - Manpower Allocation

"No, I listened to the reports very seriously before reaching the conclusion," Yang He said earnestly.

The so-called reports were provided by "Sand" (moles) sent by Dugu Qiuhun. These people were mostly temporarily borrowed from the Army, Navy, and commune members. The physical requirements were dark skin and thinness, and fluency in Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangxi, or Hubei/Hunan dialects was best because the refugees were mostly from these regions. To avoid familiar faces appearing repeatedly, the "Sand" were rotated. Every time a new batch of immigrants arrived, some were mixed in, changing batch by batch. They ate and lived with the immigrants, reporting regularly on the status of immigrants in the camp.

Wu De said unceremoniously, "What can you figure out just by listening to reports? Are you not afraid they might deceive you?"

"Unlikely..."

"Look, getting bureaucratic now. How do you know they won't deceive you?" Wu De said, "Subordinates are very good at guessing superiors' intentions. Sometimes they will unconsciously modify the content of the report according to your likes and dislikes. You must go down to look and listen more yourself!"

He took a breath. "As the head here, you must go down at least two or three times a day. Look more at their state. Clues sometimes reflect big problems. If someone is crying, ask why they are crying; if someone is laughing, know why they are laughing!"

"Oh. I know!" Yang He looked indifferent. "I will go down to look more."

Dugu Qiuhun had another important task at this time: screening the population. Specifically, censoring those refugees who acted suspiciously or obviously concealed their identities. For example, someone claiming to be a tenant farmer but having soft and fair skin; someone having sword and knife scars but saying they were an ordinary commoner...

According to the "Dangerous Persons Category List" listed by the Political Security Bureau, Dugu Qiuhun had to watch whether the refugees were infiltrated by: spies of various pirates along the South China coast; secret agents of provincial and prefectural government garrisons; Zheng Zhilong's secret agents; secret agents of the Eastern Depot and the Embroidered Uniform Guard; and Manchu secret agents. Finally, Ran Yao specially asked them to pay attention to the infiltration of cults among immigrants, and distributed a set of "Table of Doctrines and Slang Characteristics of Various Late Ming Cults" edited by Yu Eshui, collecting most sects found in historical records.

In short, all suspicious characters had to be screened. Although Wu De admitted the importance of screening, he held a skeptical attitude towards such detailed work—now the scale was hundreds to a thousand people at a time, detailed operation was fine; later when the population exploded, with tens of thousands of immigrants coming in, would they still do this?

However, the Executive Committee's attitude was that since the number of immigrants was small at the beginning, work should be done as meticulously as possible—after all, this group of people would be the backbone of various aspects of the Transmigration Regime in the future, so reliability had to be ensured.

Quite a few suspicious characters were indeed screened out, but the legendary secret agents never appeared. Instead, many escaped criminals, runaway slaves, and deserters were cleared out. In addition, some scholars who felt disgraced because they sold themselves were also picked out. Even monks were caught—because they didn't obtain ordination certificates, begging for alms and staying at temples failed, so they fell to the streets and became refugees. Because their hair hadn't grown long enough and their buns were too small, they were suspected by transmigrators to be Tartars (Manchus).

"How many people are in the camp now?"

"Seven hundred and twenty people as of 9 am today," Yang He reported. "One died early this morning."

"There was a death?" Wu De stopped in his tracks. Generally speaking, refugee deaths basically occurred in the initial stage of intake, that is, the detention stage in Guangzhou, or the first few days after arriving in Lingao for purification. But this batch of people was about to complete their one month. "What cause?"

"Sudden diarrhea. Fever. The hygienist in the camp had no way either—no antidiarrheals. I saw it was really serious and sent someone to the health center to get antidiarrheals, but he died before they were brought back. Minister Shi said the cause of death would only be known after an examination," Yang He reported. "But I have already sealed that dormitory, forbidding anyone to enter or exit, and sprinkled bleach."

"Mm," Wu De said. "The weather is getting hot recently; we must prevent possible epidemics."

"If things go wrong, it might be cholera." He Ma looked at the report sent over. "Very similar. Was a sample taken?"

"Minister Shi already took it and brought it to the health center for bacterial culture."

"Miserable, hope it's not that." Wu De was worried.

"If it really is, we in the medical department will be the miserable ones." He Ma sighed. "Why did I study medicine back then?"

His mood was very heavy. Summer arrived, and the endemic infectious disease cholera in Lingao was in the season of outbreak. The important way for the Transmigration Group to supplement protein for immigrants was seafood—the possibility of this stuff carrying bacteria was high. Thinking of that stinking seafood processing factory, it didn't look reassuring.

They naturally had medicine to cure cholera, but dealing with a large-scale cholera outbreak would inevitably be a bit beyond their ability. Moreover, the treatment of cholera patients required rehydration, and there wasn't much reserve of that stuff. He Ma scratched his scalp. "The toilet used by people in this dormitory must also be closed," He Ma issued instructions. "Disposal plan waits until results are out."

Because such an incident occurred, everyone paid special attention to sanitary inspections. After patrolling once without problems, Wu De came to the office of the Quarantine Camp. At this time, quite a few representatives from different departments had arrived here. The office wasn't big and the weather was hot, so they all squatted under the tree shade smoking and chatting one by one. Seeing Wu De's group arriving, this crowd swarmed up all at once.

"Don't rush, let's have a meeting!" Wu De naturally knew what the visitors intended, and hurriedly stopped their chaotic expressions. Because the current quarantine would end in three or four days, for various departments suffering from manpower shortage, these seven hundred refugees were a big piece of meat to be divided and eaten.

"Yang He, get some water for everyone. Make sure it's boiled."

"There is boiled herbal tea, absolutely hygienic." Yang He asked someone to bring a large old-fashioned tea bucket and put it under the tree shade. Everyone took out their own cups from their belts to drink tea.

Wu De glanced at the department representatives who were eager to try like hungry tigers, and gave an opening speech first: "I know everyone's intention-once a month! Don't be anxious, and don't talk about how difficult your department is and how important it is to the Transmigration Cause—I know all these!"

These words blocked everyone's mouths, avoiding the meeting turning into a complaining session or venting session. Sure enough, people who originally prepared to wave notebooks and make impassioned speeches had to sit back.

"Manpower is only this much. I have read your applications and also went to the Planning Committee to understand the progress and manpower demand of each department." He flipped through the folder sent over, and smiled slightly at the girl who brought the folder—this should be an indigenous girl, dark skin, big eyes, looked not bad.

"Satisfying everyone one hundred percent is impossible," Wu De smiled. "Let's distribute."

Distribution was limited to males and females over thirteen; children under thirteen full years were not counted as labor force and were directly received by the National School under the Ministry of Education.

After new immigrants underwent purification processing, they were assigned to settle in Bairen Commune and Bopu Commune according to the direction of the units receiving them—in view of the development of the Chemical-Steel Industrial Zone around Bopu Port, to facilitate the use of nearby labor, the Ministry of Civil Affairs established a new Bopu Commune in Bopu as the local civil administration agency.

The Industrial and Energy Committee obtained the largest share as usual. Bopu Chemical Plant was about to start up and begin production, needing a large number of workers. Establishing mining points in Hong Gai, Vietnam, and Tiandu, Hainan also required quite a lot of manpower.

The Ministry of Education obtained the second-largest slice of the cake this time. The Simplified Normal School took away one hundred and sixty male and female teenagers in one breath, making quite a few departments unwilling. But after Bai Yu expounded the benefits this batch of normal students could bring after graduation, everyone endured it—after all, conducting cultural education for new workers and apprentices assigned to their own departments was a heavy task that occupied manpower.

Lingao Construction Company ranked third, getting fifty people. Lingao Construction Company generally used dispatched workers from the commune, but as the volume of construction engineering increased continuously and demand for skilled job types grew larger and larger, the General Construction Company also began to build its own team of full-time indigenous skilled workers.

The medical department got thirty people. The weather was getting hot, and the population increasing; demands in healthcare and epidemic prevention were growing larger and larger.

Other departments each added some personnel, either eight or ten, or three or four. The ones who got nothing were the Army and Navy; except for supplementing vacancies from deaths and injury retirements, the Army and Navy didn't increase a single established person. This made them very annoyed. Finally, after coordination, it was decided to allocate thirty people from the children currently studying in the National School as "Targeted Students," half for Navy and half for Army. Once they obtained Class B Diplomas, they would transfer to the NCO Class of the Military-Political School to study.

The Internal Affairs Department didn't get new personnel either. First, the personnel configuration and recruitment of the Security Bureau were not public. Second, Ran Yao, who was in charge of police administration, was not very enthusiastic about adding personnel—from the perspective of saving, the Army and Navy were enough for temporary riot control besides training and working. What he was engaging in now was "Mass Prevention and Control"; in other words, everyone was responsible for security tasks, don't push everything to us Uncle Police.

After distributing personnel, Bai Yu from the Ministry of Education conveyed the notice of restructuring the Apprentice Corps into the Vocational Technical School.

"Just changing a name! To facilitate centralized registration, centralized accommodation, and centralized management." Bai Yu feared someone might misunderstand, thinking that entering the Vocational Technical School meant becoming manpower under the Ministry of Education. "The Ministry of Education is only responsible for students' life management and cultural education! Specific vocational skills education is still organized by various departments and enterprises themselves."

"What about the Military-Political School?" The Army and Navy also regarded this issue heavily.

"Same handling method," Bai Yu said. "This part of professional study is still heavily your own responsibility."

"So it's dual leadership? The requirements for cadets in military school are different from others!"
