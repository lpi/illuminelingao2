# Chapter 460 - Autumn Levy (Part 11)

"How could I not desire revenge!" Gou Chengxuan had originally been terrified of the Baldies. Returning to the county, he had only intended to invoke the principle that "darkness lies directly beneath the lamp"—to hide quietly, await news of his father, and see if an opportunity might arise to retrieve the iron strongbox Gou Er had sunk into a well. With the treasure inside that box, he could flee far away. But now, stirred by the Lai brothers' provocations, the hatred in his heart began to ferment. He had once commanded the wind and rain in this county—what a magnificent figure he had been! Now he couldn't even return home, reduced to a beggar eking out a wretched existence. The mere thought filled him with rage.

To exact revenge, he would need to rely on his own strength. During the trip accompanying his father to Guangzhou, though they had failed to accomplish anything, Gou Chengxuan had gained considerable worldly experience. He knew that counting on the imperial court was mere daydreaming—unless affairs in Lingao became completely unmanageable, the officials at court couldn't be bothered.

Having grown up under his father's and uncle's tutelage, with Gou Family Manor sheltering all manner of desperate outlaws, Gou Chengxuan knew plenty about the ways of the *jianghu*. He understood that attempting to create trouble right under the Baldies' noses was pure fantasy. For now, he could only hide and await his opportunity. To this end, he and the Lai brothers had been lying low in this desolate Fubo Shrine. He possessed some silver obtained from his maternal relatives, plus some rudimentary martial skills. The other beggars who used the shrine as a resting place had all been brought under his control and followed his orders—though they remained ignorant of his true identity. Unknowingly, he had established a small "beggars' confederation" right in the county seat.

Gou Chengxuan was extremely cautious. He rarely even visited the East Gate Market, confining his activities to the county seat—where the Baldies seldom ventured. When they did appear, they stood out so conspicuously in a crowd that he could spot them immediately and keep his distance. He and the Lai brothers gathered intelligence only while begging along the streets.

These past days, he had learned of most of the transmigrators' various measures in the county. Gou Chengxuan realized this Australian gang harbored no small ambitions—they likely even harbored traitorous, rebellious intentions. This delighted him. If this were simply a case of bandits eating bandits, his family's grievance would sink forever without redress—though others might call it just deserts. But the Baldies were clearly preparing for open rebellion. In three years or five, the court would have to dispatch a punitive expedition! When the imperial forces arrived, with his meritorious service in supporting them, his day of vindication would surely come.

Recently, news of the transmigrators' grain levy through Chen Minggang had also reached his ears. During his begging rounds, through kitchen servants and gatekeepers at the major households, he had gleaned plenty of information regarding their discontent. This development made Gou Chengxuan feel that opportunity was at hand. He ordered his people to inquire at the county school—being a former *xiucai* himself, he knew that scholars were always the most enthusiastic discussing current affairs.

After careful deliberation, Gou Chengxuan decided to plant an informant within the county school. As it happened, Wang Ci's finances had recently become quite comfortable, and he was looking to hire a few more menial workers. Lai Xiao, being younger and less notorious than his older brother, assumed his most pitiful expression and managed to secure the position. Thus, Huang Binkun's activities at the county school became known to Gou Chengxuan in complete detail.

Embracing the principle that one's enemy's enemy is an ally, Gou Chengxuan believed he could win over Huang Binkun. He pondered this all night. The Huang father and son were major households with a blood feud against the Baldies—a son and brother killed. He was certain they would never forget. The Gou and Huang families had been at odds in the past, but they had never actually come to blows.

"Young Master, isn't this too risky? What if that Huang fellow sells you out..." The Lai brothers tried to dissuade him. Lai Da offered to speak with Huang Binkun himself.

"It's fine! You are of too low a station; Huang Binkun wouldn't trust you. I must go personally." Gou Chengxuan spoke with confidence. "Don't worry! Not only does the Huang family have a blood feud with the Baldies—back when fighting them, they exerted themselves the most! Liu Dalin only schemed and plotted, but the Huangs took the field bare-chested. For that alone, the Huangs and the Baldies are sworn enemies. He might ignore me, but he'd never sell me out."

Watching Huang Binkun walk away, a slight smile touched Gou Chengxuan's lips. When it came to reading people's expressions, he was a hundred times more skilled than this sheltered son of a scholarly farming family. In that instant, he had already perceived Huang Binkun's inner turmoil and hesitation... There was hope!

He quickly rose and ducked into another alley—one could never be too careful. Gou Chengxuan took a circuitous route through deserted back streets, waited nearly two hours until he was sure nothing was amiss, then finally returned to the Fubo Shrine.

This Fubo Shrine had been constructed during the Hongwu reign of the Great Ming. In its day, the complex had been substantial—three successive courtyards. Now only the main hall of the second courtyard and the buildings in the last courtyard remained relatively intact. Everything else had long since collapsed into rubble. The surrounding walls were crumbling, full of holes, and the yard was overgrown with weeds. Even in broad daylight, no one passed by. It made an excellent hiding place.

Gou Chengxuan and Lai Da occupied the rearmost courtyard buildings. As the "confederation" chieftain now, having a beggar attendant wasn't unusual. The other five or six beggars lived in the front courtyard. Gou Chengxuan collected a token tribute from them, but actually often subsidized them for running errands and performing small tasks. For now, though, he dared not entrust them with anything serious.

He had just returned when Lai Xiao arrived, cleaned up and tidy, waiting for him in the room.

"Young Master!" Lai Xiao called out upon seeing him.

"Don't call me Young Master—are you trying to get me killed?!" Gou Chengxuan's face darkened.

"Yes, yes, I forgot again—Boss Chen!" Gou Chengxuan had given himself the alias "Chen Ji," implying he would never forget his hatred. Lai Xiao hurriedly reported what had transpired at the county school—Huang Binkun's failed attempt to mobilize the scholars for a petition.

"...Apart from that blockhead Li Xiaopeng, none of the scholars were willing to step forward."

"Good." Gou Chengxuan reasoned that Huang Binkun, lacking allies, would be much more likely to join forces with him. He told Lai Xiao about his own encounter that day.

"It just so happens he hit a snag today," Gou Chengxuan said smugly. "Truly Heaven is helping me!"

"We should be cautious of others," Lai Xiao suggested. "Young Master—ah, Boss—don't you think we should prepare a few more hiding places? So we can disappear at the first sign of trouble..."

"Mm, I've considered that, but I haven't been able to identify a better spot just yet."

Lingao city had a small population and plenty of vacant buildings—either "official shrines" or various "official buildings" constructed long ago and now abandoned. But most of these structures had collapsed and become uninhabitable.

---

"There are plenty of empty barracks at the small drill ground by the North Gate," Lai Xiao said. "I've had a look. A few are still livable. There are lots of buildings there, like a maze. And it's close to—close to Boss Chen's old home. Maybe there'll be a chance to go back and take a look..."

Gou Chengxuan knew there were indeed large stretches of empty barracks near the sealed North Gate. It was certainly a hiding place. But precisely because it was close to his home, he had avoided it—who knew if the Baldies had planted watchers nearby? Besides, now that he harbored thoughts of waiting for an opportunity to strike, his desire for the treasure had somewhat faded.

But he hadn't told the Lai brothers about the treasure in the well—he had to guard against greed.

"That won't work. There might be watchers there. Too much coming and going would draw attention." Gou Chengxuan shook his head.

"The Qingjie Yuan should also serve."

The Qingjie Yuan was the county's shelter for "chaste widows" who had committed to remaining unmarried. This semi-official, semi-private institution had long since become unsustainable in a small county with a sparse population and strained finances. The buildings had fallen into ruin.

"Fine." He nodded. "Tonight I'll have your brother go prepare things there. We need to have three burrows like a cunning rabbit."

Just then, Lai Da returned as well. He had been specifically sent to the city gate that day to check the heads on display and the proclamations. Gou Chengxuan didn't dare inquire openly about bandit-suppression affairs in the city. He had only been passively listening to gossip, never hearing news of Rotten-Eye Hu's or his father's death. This gave him some relief. Having heard that the city gate displayed the heads of executed bandit leaders along with proclamations, he had instructed Lai Da to investigate—Lai Da could recognize a few characters—to see if those names appeared.

"I've looked," Lai Da reported. "The heads have all rotted—can't tell who is who. But neither Rotten-Eye Hu nor the Master's name appeared on the proclamations! They're probably safe."

"That's for the best!" Gou Chengxuan relaxed. "Rotten-Eye Hu's stronghold must still be standing!"

"Then I'll go look around sometime!" Lai Da volunteered.

"Good, you go scout the situation." Gou Chengxuan thought that if he could contact his father through this, he'd have another source of support.

"Young Master—" Lai Da hesitated. "There's something else."

"Go on."

"I saw another proclamation. It said... it said..." Lai Da swallowed hard. "Your *xiucai* status has been revoked..."

Gou Chengxuan's face instantly went white as paper. He stood frozen for a moment. Lai Xiao quickly steadied him. "Young Master!"

"It's nothing!" Gou Chengxuan blinked several times and waved his hand, but involuntarily sank into a seat. This blow was too great. The *xiucai* status was the most useful credential he possessed. It was precisely because of this credential that the Gou family had been able to stand toe-to-toe with the county's gentry—otherwise, they would always have remained mere local thugs. Because of this credential, wherever he went, officials and gentry had to treat him with some courtesy.

Now this credential had been stripped away! Henceforth, he would be a "commoner" who had to kneel before county magistrates, a man who could be stripped and beaten at any misstep! The magnitude of this blow nearly made him collapse. Lai Xiao, seeing his expression shifting and his face turning pale as cold sweat streamed down, knew he was on the verge of a breakdown. He quickly pulled out some "Zhuge Marching Powder" and blew it into his nostrils. After a moment, Gou Chengxuan slowly came back to himself.

"Young Master, don't take it so hard. What's done is done—" Lai Da began to offer consolation when Gou Chengxuan said weakly, "Say no more. The way things are now, what difference does having a degree make?"
