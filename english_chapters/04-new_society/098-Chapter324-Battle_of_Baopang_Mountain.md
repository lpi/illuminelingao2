# Chapter 324 - Battle of Baopang Mountain

The troops set out after dark, marched rapidly all night, and entered the Baopang Mountain area to conceal themselves. After resting for a whole day, they continued marching at night. With the aid of complete maps and night vision equipment, they suddenly reached Dang Namen's mountain stronghold in the morning.

The stronghold stood on a small earthen hill, surrounded by sturdy walls mixed with stone and wood and watchtowers. The level of fortification was quite good, capable of withstanding ordinary attacks.

Seen through binoculars, the terrain around the stronghold wasn't precipitous but was quite complex. While terrain easy to defend and hard to attack was good, once besieged, it was also very difficult to break out. Therefore, bandit strongholds were generally not built on particularly perilous dead ends; being able to escape quickly in unfavorable situations was the priority. If they had come with a mighty force, Dang Namen would have had plenty of time to withdraw from the stronghold and use the terrain here to scatter and flee. But now, He Ming had already commanded the troops to seize the three main access passages near the stronghold before dawn, sealing off the escape routes—all credit to modern maps and night vision equipment.

"Troops have all arrived at the designated locations and are constructing fortifications!" the apprentice staff officer reported.

"Order all units to observe enemy movements closely." He Ming put down his binoculars and glanced at the map. Troops had been assigned blocking missions on all access passages where escape was possible.

"Look sharp, everyone!" Pan Da urged his engineers and the Education Soldiers assigned to him. Laying on the ground, they were struggling to dig pits to bury simple anti-personnel mines. Another group was building breastworks for shooting with soil.

Apart from the main road into the mountains, of the three roads the bandits might use to escape, Datai Slope was the hardest to choke off. The other two were small mountain paths where twenty soldiers building a temporary low wall of earth and shrubs could block the bandits with volleys and hand grenades.

But Datai Slope wasn't a small path; it was a broad slope. If the bandits rushed past this place, they would have countless mountain paths to choose from.

Pan Da had no choice but to intercept the bandits on this open ground.

His military strength was second only to the troops directly under the command post, consisting of an infantry platoon, an engineer squad, and thirty "Education Soldiers." The Education Soldiers hadn't been issued guns yet, only bayonets and temporarily issued spears. Raising flags and shouting to boost morale was fine.

Fortunately, he brought the engineer's common weapon: landmines.

Of course, this landmine wasn't any kind familiar to everyone. Although some jokingly called it the "Claymore Directional Mine," it was actually a primitive and crude anti-personnel directional mine. Simple to the point of not needing a mine casing. As for the directional angle, only Heaven knew.

The entire equipment consisted of a pack of black powder, a fuse, an iron plate, and a pile of scrap metal. Dig a shallow pit by the roadside, place the explosive pack, cover it with an iron plate for directionality, and then pile on a layer of various fragments that could cause bloody heads and broken flow. Of course, right now all metal was strategic material, so the mines Pan Da brought didn't have iron plates but hardwood boards. According to test results, as for the scrap metal acting as shrapnel, it was replaced by crushed stones—these stones were carefully selected from the quarry, basically consistent in size.

Pan Da's engineers were burying these "Earth Mines" at every intersection where escape was possible. Originally, detonating mines could only use fuses, making it hard to control the firing time. Laying fuses that were both concealed and reliable for firing was a difficulty. Since the chemical department produced white phosphorus and red phosphorus, the technical problem of the friction primer was finally overcome—although this technology mainly facilitated artillery firing, engineers also enjoyed the benefits of this improvement.

The entire width of Datai Slope was about 60 meters. Each directional mine could cover a distance of about 5 to 6 meters. Pan Da set up three groups of cross-set mines on the entire slope, fifteen in each group.

"Everyone listen to my command, set the sight to 100 meters." Yang Zeng briefed his soldiers on the combat plan. "We will use a two-rank formation and fire volleys on command. Understood?"

"Understood!" The soldiers answered in unison.

"Good, everyone fix bayonets!"

The soldiers drew bright bayonets from their leather scabbards and attached them. Yang Zeng checked the soldiers' bayonets, guns, and ammunition, then spoke a few words to the Education Soldiers lined up behind. Recruits going onto the battlefield for the first time were a bit trembling, not even knowing how to hold their spears.

Yang Zeng said a few encouraging words. Although he couldn't speak of having much military service experience, he knew they couldn't be counted on in a critical moment. He still had to rely on the veterans—the so-called veterans were just those who had trained a few months more. Their combat experience was just fighting once when pirates attacked. Some had simply lined up once and didn't even get a chance to fire at the pirates.

Seeing Chief Pan directing soldiers with shovels digging pits everywhere, Yang Zeng couldn't help feeling empty inside. Although he had learned about "landmines" during officer study, he really had no bottom line on how much power they actually had. *It would be worry-free if we were equipped with a cannon here,* he thought.

Pan Da himself didn't have much confidence. He checked the friction primers, fuses, and pull-cords of the directional mines everywhere again and again, and even did a few dry pulls to ensure there were no obstacles when pulling and that they could fire effectively—whether they could withstand the bandits' fierce rush depended on how much power this "Heavenly Maidens Scattering Flowers" actually had.

If the bandits were truly fearless of death and dared to "Pig Rush" (Banzai Charge), using flesh and blood to open a path through the mines, then Pan Da had a final move—the grenade discharger. Engineers were setting up this simple "small cannon."

This was a cheap and simple weapon developed by the machinery department's weapon design group. Since the invention of the "handheld shotgun cannon," the weapon group set off a climax of designing disposable simple support weapons. This grenade discharger was a product of this climax.

A cast iron tube, loaded with a gunpowder pack, then loaded with a cast iron No. 4 grenade—the chain-shot grenade that once terrified the New Army soldiers and created the Army's first martyr. With the throwing cord removed, under the propulsion of black powder, it could be projected to 50 meters away at a 65-degree angle. However, the accuracy could only be said to be generally correct in the direction of projection.

The detonation fuse on the No. 4 grenade would be ignited simultaneously at the moment the propellant exploded—similar to the ignition method of smoothbore cannons firing grenades. However, the grenade problem existed here too—probably one-third of the No. 4 grenades wouldn't detonate. The detonation rate was much lower than lighting it manually and throwing it out.

"Even if it doesn't explode, smashing onto a human head will make it blossom. Just consider it firing solid shot." Pan Da wasn't too picky about this weapon. He brought twenty out for testing.

All ammunition was pre-loaded. The muzzle was sealed with wax paper, and there was a wax-sealed ignition port at the tail. When firing, one just had to insert the friction primer and pull. The grenade discharger came with a simple stand and baseplate. If one didn't fear the danger of barrel explosion, it could also be handheld for firing.

Theoretically, this grenade discharger could be reloaded on the battlefield, but for safety, the military industry department suggested troops return them to the factory for reloading after firing.

If the last move couldn't stop the enemy either, they would have to rely on rifle fire and hand-to-hand combat. Although Pan Da had absolute confidence that infantry bayonets trained by professional soldiers with high organization and discipline could completely crush bandits, he still inevitably felt somewhat trembling in his heart.

The sudden arrival of bandit suppression troops at the city walls startled Dang Namen, who had just gotten up in the morning. He had his own intelligence sources: he knew that this group of ocean-going bandits from Australia was going to suppress the Greenwood (bandits) recently. At first, he didn't take it seriously; after all, mountains and seas were separate wells that didn't interfere with each other. Moreover, the "Thirteen Villages" area under his control had expressed submission to this group of Australians, giving whatever was required without shortage. There was no reason to attack him.

He climbed up the stronghold wall to look. On the hillside a *li* away, dense crowds of Australian troops wearing gray tight-fitting small jackets were visible. Some carried bird guns (muskets/rifles), some long spears, all shining in the sunlight. For a moment, he couldn't tell how many men and horses there were.

Such a force actually marched through the mountains at night and arrived silently below his stronghold. Thinking of this, he instantly turned cold—the Australians coming suddenly fully armed definitely harbored ill intentions. He had long heard that the Australians' firearms were extremely fierce, and their cannons could destroy anything—defending the stronghold to the death would definitely be the end. He immediately called all his subordinate leaders over:

"Everyone, don't panic!" He glanced at the leaders who were somewhat panic-stricken—the opponent's force arrived so suddenly and secretly, greatly shocking the bandits. "The Bald Thieves have fierce firearms; we can't fight them head-on. Prepare to 'Flow Water'!"

"Flowing Water" meant scattering and escaping to various secret camps in the mountains to hide, waiting for the wind to pass before gathering again. It was a common trick of bandits.

"Boss Dang!" Zhao Haiqing, one of the Four Heavenly Kings, said, "Flowing Water is easy, but the women, gold, silver, and grain in the stronghold..."

"Why care about that?" Although Dang Namen was reluctant, he had the big picture in mind after all. "As long as the green hills remain, there's no fear of running out of firewood. Silver and women can be had anytime. If your little life is gone, it's all fart! Go quickly."

The leaders heard reason and scattered, instructing the bandits to prepare to "Flow Water." For a time, the stronghold was in chaos. Unwilling to leave behind money, the bandits stuffed big ingots of silver, foreign silver dollars, and jewelry onto their bodies. Everyone stuffed themselves full, bulging all over. Dang Namen knew it was bad, but the chaotic bandit crowd completely ignored his orders. Dang Namen had to take his seven or eight trusted aides and "Flow Water" on their own.

"Light the fire! Burn the stronghold down!" Dang Namen ordered.

"Boss!" Although they knew these things definitely wouldn't be theirs anymore, the few trusted aides still couldn't bring themselves to burn the old nest occupied for many years.

"Don't be stingy!" Dang Namen spat viciously. "Not burning it is also cheapening this bunch of Bald Thieves. Burn it all; we leave cleanly!"

Actually, Dang Namen still had a calculation in his heart. Once the fire started, the Australians, coming for wealth and grain, would rush to put out the fire and wouldn't be able to attend to chasing them. It would be easier for everyone to escape with their lives.

"Fire! There's a fire!" Someone shouted in the command post.

"The enemy is starting to run." He Ming said, raising his binoculars.

In an instant, the stronghold gate opened wide. In the binoculars, bandits carrying large and small bags, holding swords, axes, guns, and spears, split into multiple groups fleeing in all directions.

He Ming watched their directions, confirming that his side hadn't missed any roads.

Shortly after, gunshots rang out in the distance. Puffs of white light smoke rose amidst the green mountains and clear waters, looking quite beautiful.

"Fighting has started at the left mountain pass!"

He Ming adjusted the focus of the binoculars to see the battle situation, but couldn't see anything clearly. The large amount of smoke from rifle fire obscured the battlefield.

He frowned and turned the lens to another mountain path where bandits were breaking out. The terrain here was slightly more open, and the smoke was quickly carried away by the wind. Forty or fifty bandits, dressed bulgingly and carrying bundles, were rushing towards the slopes on both sides of the pass. White smoke sprayed from the positions above from time to time. Bandits who were hit rolled down the slope; some fell wounded, struggling desperately on the ground.

"Strange, are they wearing some armor?" He Ming felt strange; he had never heard of bandits having armor.

From a person hit and struggling in death throes, several shiny white silver ingots rolled out from his torn clothes.

It turned out the bulges were all loaded valuables. Everyone suddenly realized. Someone said: "Truly men die for wealth. Carrying so many burdens, even escaping isn't nimble. Without them, maybe they could have run out."

"Not necessarily—" Just as someone rebutted, explosion sounds rang out in the distance. A patch of white smoke rose at the pass, debris and earth flew chaotically, and faint screams could be heard. This was the Tu-Claymore mines being detonated.

"Detonated! Detonated!" Followed by the excited voices of the staff officers behind,

Directional mines were detonated one after another. Nothing could be seen in the binoculars anymore. He Ming put down the binoculars and asked: "Any new movement in the stronghold?"

"Not yet. The fire is burning big. Probably everyone ran out."

"Order First Platoon to move towards the stronghold gate. Occupy the stronghold when the opportunity arises. Don't rush to put out the fire." He Ming ordered, "Reinforce them with the cannons." The urgent task was to wipe out the bandits completely. Whether there were valuables in the stronghold or not didn't matter to the big picture.

The bandits preparing to "Flow Water" were driven back from every intersection. They never dreamed that the enemy would actually set ambushes in these places, waiting specifically for them to charge. Several batches of bandits attempting to "Flow Water" were beaten bloody at the intersections, with more than half dead or injured. Many ran back again.

Dang Namen had a very quick mind. Knowing that hesitating now was a dead end, he hurriedly called everyone:

"Don't panic! Drop all the silver on your bodies. With life, there is money. Everyone break out together from Datai Slope!"

Under his repeated shouting, more than a hundred people gathered around him again, all in constant panic, staring at Dang Namen, wanting him to come up with an idea quickly.

PS: Notes are outside the 4000 words and are not charged.

Regarding the behavior of Dang Namen's bandits, it comes from accounts of bandit activities during the Republic of China period in Lingao literary history.
