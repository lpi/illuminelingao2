# Chapter 344 - Acids and Bases (III)

Safety in production was Ji Situi's biggest headache. Accidents in chemical plants were different from ordinary enterprises: apart from worker casualties, equipment would be damaged, and the terrible consequences of chemical leaks were even harder to predict. The casual attitude of these former farmers towards dangerous goods really overwhelmed him—he conducted safety production education several times and severely rebuked a few guys who didn't wear protective suits according to regulations.

Several unlucky guys stood dejectedly hanging their heads and were scolded by him for a full half hour. Given Lingao's climatic conditions, operating by the furnace in full-body protection was indeed a kind of torture. Fiberglass leggings, rubber aprons, long-arm gloves, and high boots were all airtight things; even if not operating by the furnace, one would be dripping with sweat after a few minutes.

"Do you want to become like him?!" Ji Situi took out a medical atlas—he got it from the Grand Library, and the photos inside were all of patients with chemical burns.

But the effect of the photos was really too terrifying, so much so that it had the opposite effect. Several indigenous workers came to beg him, saying they didn't want to do this work anymore. This made Ji Situi choke with anger.

After a round of appeasement, promises, and threats that if they didn't work they would be sent to the Labor Reform Team to taste the legendary whip of Fu Youdi, he finally calmed the hearts of the people in the sulfuric acid workshop, and production became normal. Only then did Ji Situi pull himself out and rush to the caustic soda workshop. Outside the workshop, large and small water vats and a large amount of salt were already piled up. Bing Feng was leading people to install equipment.

"Salt, tap water, and water vats are all here. While the engineering isn't finished yet, let's mix saturated brine first," Bai Yu, who volunteered to bring students to help, said. Although he became a teacher, he was still a chemistry enthusiast.

"This salt won't do." Xu Yingjie shook his head. "Crude salt! Too many impurities."

Electrolyzing salt to make caustic soda was very simple in principle: directly electrolyzing saturated brine to decompose sodium hydroxide—also known as caustic soda—and simultaneously decompose chlorine gas and hydrogen gas. But the salt sent from Yanchang Village was crude salt without purification, containing not only sodium salts but also various impurities like potassium salts, magnesium salts, sulfates, etc. Impurities being produced would affect decomposition efficiency and damage precious electrodes.

Therefore, before electrolysis, crude salt must be processed and purified first to remove impurities and become a pure saturated sodium chloride solution before being put into production. The modern timeline had a highly developed industrial system with division of labor; the caustic soda industry could completely purchase purified sodium chloride finished products. Here, everything had to be done by themselves. The more backward and primitive the industry, the more things needed for self-sufficiency.

Ji Situi first analyzed the salt sent over. The quality of salt from Yanchang Village was very high; the content of sulfate components, which affected electrolysis most, was extremely low. This was good news for him: the industrial method to remove sulfate used barium chloride—he didn't have this thing, and barium chloride was a highly toxic chemical; even if it could be synthesized, he didn't want to do it. As for the content of calcium salts and magnesium salts, it wasn't high either; it was very ideal industrial salt.

He asked people to pour baskets of crude salt into the settling tank. After adding water to a saturated state, Bai Yu, responsible for refining the electrolyte, took the drawn soda ash and caustic soda and added them proportionately according to the tested brine components, so that calcium salts and magnesium salts therein would chemically react with them to generate calcium chloride and magnesium hydroxide precipitates. The clarified liquid above was the saturated sodium chloride solution used for electrolysis. Because caustic soda and soda ash were added, a small amount of dilute hydrochloric acid had to be used for neutralization treatment.

Electrolyzing salt in production was a continuous process; saturated sodium chloride solution must be continuously supplemented into the electrolytic cell. Therefore, brine purification was carried out non-stop throughout the electrolysis process.

Using the intermittent purification method of making vat by vat was simple in operation and equipment, but labor intensity was too great, consuming too much manpower. Generally, continuous purification methods were adopted in industry. Although Ji Situi was doing indigenous methods, he decided to make the degree of production automation as high as possible.

Based on his own conditions—having a tap water supply—Ji Situi decided to use continuous operation in the salt dissolving stage during formal production. Water flowed in from the bottom of the specialized dissolving tank, passed through the salt layer inside the tank, and overflowed from the upper outlet of the tank. Salt was added intermittently by manpower to maintain a certain salt layer. The dissolved brine was saturated brine, introduced from the dissolving tank into the settling tank for neutralization treatment.

To reduce labor intensity, the positions of brine tanks was made into a stepped shape, one higher than another, so that potential difference and the siphon principle could be used for brine transportation. From low to high, it was Dissolving Tank - Settling Tank - Neutralization Tank. Finally, the saturated sodium chloride solution flowing out of the Neutralization Tank was sent into the Heating Tank.

This system was simpler than that used in industry and didn't require any mechanical assistance. A small amount of manpower was enough.

"Making caustic soda actually requires adding caustic soda!" Bai Yu, leading students to handle brine, said.

Xu Yingjie said, "These are two different things. You are making purified brine, which is miles away from caustic soda manufacturing."

Bai Yu said, "Fortunately, we brought a lot of chemical products; otherwise, without them as 'primers', wouldn't we be unable to start work?"

"Not necessarily." Ji Situi said while watching the reaction situation in the tank. "It would just damage electrodes heavily. Doing purely physical purification of sodium chloride is not impossible either. But it needs huge investment, starting from directly transforming the salt industry equipment in Yanchang Village."

"The salt industry equipment in Yanchang Village has been modified quite a bit, right?"

"The transformation project Engineer Wang engaged in mainly targeted increasing output; he engaged in windmill lifting brine and showering for drying, shortening the concentration time of brine." Ji Situi had been to Yanchang Village several times due to business relations.

"Speaking of purification, it's definitely impossible without a boiler." Ji Situi continued, "The Planning Committee originally said to build a Refined Salt Factory in Bopu; once our caustic soda workshop starts production, this project must be launched."

"Construction climax of chemical industry!" Xu Yingjie lamented.

"It should be the chemical industry's turn. Think about it: Pesticides, Chemical Fertilizers, Explosives, Medicine. Once these Four Magic Weapons come out, won't we dominate the globe!" Bai Yu was in high spirits.

"That's still far away; don't think of becoming fat with one bite." Ji Situi said, "There are still many supporting facilities and equipment needed in chemical engineering. Practical problems in production have to be solved slowly. Take the first batch of sulfuric acid made by the sulfuric acid plant for example. The impurity content is very high, which is very dangerous in certain chemical productions. But increasing purity requires satisfying many conditions."

He used a metaphor, "This is like a jigsaw puzzle. After making Three Acids and Two Alkalis, we only just found the four corners of the puzzle and saw hope, but to truly piece together the complete pattern, it will take a very long time."

Xu Yingjie commented, "This is like someone using glycerol produced by saponification method to mix nitroglycerin; the theory isn't wrong, but in practice, it will cost lives."

The entire reaction and precipitation process of brine would last 24 hours. Ji Situi took people to the lime kiln again. Quicklime was already prepared here. According to data in the process manual, he calculated how much chlorine gas would be produced in 72 hours of continuous production and how much slaked lime was needed to absorb it. Weighed a sufficient amount of quicklime, then slowly sprayed water on it to make it slake slowly. After slaking ended, let workers sieve the slaked lime, then load it into baskets and transport it to the caustic soda workshop.

Ji Situi asked Xu Yingjie to measure the moisture content of the slaked lime, about 3%. This ratio was slightly high, so he asked people to pile the slaked lime in the shed for a few days. There was still some quicklime in the slaked lime; letting moisture continue to slake the lime would drop the moisture to below the suitable 1% after a few days.

After everything was ready, the next day, a large amount of white sediment had deposited in the brine purification tank. The test results of the clarified liquid extracted from above showed it already met the requirements for electrolysis. Bai Yu used the siphon principle to pump the clarified saturated sodium chloride solution to the Heating Tank. Ji Situi set up firewood under the Heating Tank to heat the brine to 70°C. Heating was to remove carbon dioxide from it.

The white sediment in the settling tank was collected; its main components were calcium chloride and magnesium hydroxide. Both were useful chemicals and couldn't be discarded easily. Especially calcium chloride; the pharmaceutical factory could use it to manufacture calcium chloride injections and tablets to treat various diseases caused by hypocalcemia. In industry, it could serve as a common desiccant, antifreeze in construction, refrigerant for refrigeration equipment, deinking waste paper... Finally, it could be used to coagulate tofu.

Ji Situi used the difference in solubility of the two in water to separate them—calcium chloride dissolved easily, while magnesium hydroxide was insoluble in water. Adding water to dissolve calcium chloride, then pouring it out for separate processing. The insoluble part was magnesium hydroxide. Although magnesium hydroxide was not so versatile, as an alkaline salt, it could replace caustic soda and lime as a neutralizer for acid-containing wastewater; used as an oil additive for anti-corrosion and desulfurization; used for insulation materials and acting as a building flame retardant. It was also an excellent desulfurizer; Ji Situi's sulfuric acid workshop flue needed this right now to effectively purify polluting gases in the acid-making process.

The heated sodium chloride was easily pumped into the electrolytic cell to fill it. Ji Situi pulled down the electric switch, and the entire electrolysis process began automatically. He wore a set of anti-electric protective suit and rubber-soled shoes, and measured around the electrolytic cell and the workshop floor with a test pen—no leakage occurred.

Electrolyte began to drip from the outlet. The color was clear; no terrible black liquid flowed out. He waited silently for five minutes to calculate if the electrolyte flow rate was normal. Finally, he measured the temperature and voltage inside the tank again—everything was normal. Whether temperature and voltage were normal determined the electrolysis efficiency in the tank.

"What comes out is caustic soda solution, right?" Bai Yu asked.
