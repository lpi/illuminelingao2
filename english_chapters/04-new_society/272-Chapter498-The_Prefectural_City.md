# Chapter 498 - The Prefectural City

The boat boss was eager to leave this place and hurriedly ordered his men to turn the rudder and hoist the sails, heading for the open sea. Just then, white waves churned on the sea surface as two Type 8154 fishing trawlers entered the harbor. These two trawlers had recently undergone a large-scale refit and were conducting sea trials. The refit removed the fishery production equipment and some navigation and electronic equipment deemed too advanced for this spacetime, added weapons, set up a dedicated ammunition magazine, expanded fuel tanks and crew quarters, and installed armor in key areas, making them worthy of their "cruiser" status.

Watching these steel warships drive past five hundred meters off the beam with awe-inspiring majesty and thundering engines—disregarding wind direction and currents, sailing like the wind without sails or oars, traversing the ocean surface as easily as a flat road—Tang Yunwen turned pale and sat down on the fishing nets as if all strength had left him.

"My Lord!" Zhang Wen hurriedly went over to help him up.

"It's nothing!" Tang Yunwen waved his hand. "Go back quickly!"

Tang Yunwen sat for a while, calmed his mind, then stood up and went down to sit in the cabin, feeling cold sweat all over his head. The Type 8154 trawlers gave him a greater shock than the big iron ship. The iron ship was nothing more than "big," and he didn't believe that behemoth could move by itself. But he saw these trawlers moving with his own eyes. As a naval commander, he knew very well how much power an opponent with such ships would have in naval warfare.

"Those ships are terrifying." Zhang Wen also clicked his tongue.

"Those are Iron Fast Ships," the boat boss said. "Also brought by the Australians."

"You mean they have more than one big iron ship?" Zhang Wen said nervously. *More iron ships?*

"Of course more than one." The boat boss said very proudly. "Besides the Iron Fast Ships, I've seen a kind of big ship with very low gunwales and a very flat deck. Originally it was loaded with big iron boxes, but now there's only a big well sweep on it..." The boat boss gestured. "Some people have seen a square-headed ship of the Australians, which doesn't need to enter the harbor and can go up and down the beach by itself. The bow can open, and once opened, it's a ramp..."

"Absurd!" Zhang Wen couldn't help commenting. "If the bow opens, wouldn't it sink in the sea?"

The boat boss laughed: "Vice Commander! That's just a legend among folks. I haven't seen it, so I don't know if it's true."

Tang Yunwen wasn't interested in the ship with an opening bow; he was most concerned about these "Iron Fast Ships." He asked: "How many Iron Fast Ships do these Australians have?"

"That I don't know." The boat boss said. "The Australian ships are all docked at a special wharf on the other side of Bopu Harbor. General ships aren't allowed to approach. Small boats patrol the water all the time, forbidding crossing the line."

"Those who love excitement and insist on getting close to look get caught—none of those caught have been released." The smile on the boat boss's face disappeared. "I heard they are used as coolies for the Australians."

Perhaps thinking that his act of carrying officers to inspect Bopu would meet the same fate if discovered by the Australians, the boat boss stood up, patted his butt, and repeatedly scolded the boat hands, telling them to scull quickly and leave.

"My Lord, these Iron Fast Ships are indeed tricky..."

Tang Yunwen nodded. He considered that to force the Australians to evacuate Lingao, military conquest would undoubtedly result in defeat. The only way was to follow the method used against the Red-haired barbarians in Penghu back then: approaching with a large army to force peace through strength. The Australians came from afar; after all, they had few ships and people. Although they vigorously recruited local vagrants to replenish their strength, their scale was limited. If his side showed its might with ten or twenty times the advantage, he didn't worry that the opponent wouldn't retreat in the face of difficulties.

At the end of the Wanli reign, the Red-haired barbarians arrived in Penghu with three large ships; government troops dispatched fifty warjunks to force them away. When they occupied Penghu for the second time in the fourth year of Tianqi, the Red-haired barbarians had no more than a dozen large and small warships and a landing force of only eight hundred men. Yu Zigao led over ten thousand men in a standoff for eight months before forcing them to withdraw. The Australians' current strength and scale were far above the Red-haired barbarians of that time.

By his estimation, to expel the Australians occupying Bopu, he would need to mobilize a force no smaller than that used to expel the Red-haired barbarians from Penghu during the Wanli and Tianqi eras. The mobilized troops would be at least ten thousand, with fifty warships, to besiege the Australians around Bopu and force them to retreat. Apart from this, there was no other way.

Lin Baiguang walked on the main street in front of the county office in Qiongshan County, dressed as a small merchant. He was going to visit a person. And this person had a great relationship with his plan for coming here.

The transmigrator group's rule in Lingao was deepening, and the plan to open branch bases at important resource points across the island was also being implemented. The next step was to penetrate and control the prefectures and counties of the entire island.

Other prefectures and counties on the island had no significant political or military meaning. The Executive Committee believed the key was Qiongshan County. Qiongshan County was the premier county of Qiongzhou Prefecture, the gateway in and out of Hainan Island, the island's political and economic center, the core of Great Ming's rule, and the station for the island's only mobile force with combat capability.

If the Ming army wanted to launch a military encirclement and suppression campaign against Lingao, this was the inevitable place for the heavy army to cross the sea and assemble; if the transmigrator group wanted to launch a war to unify the island, they also had to defeat the garrison at White Sand Water Fortress, capture Haikou Battalion City, and occupy the Qiongshan county seat. Other prefectures and counties on the island would basically be settled by sending a circular. For this reason, the Intelligence Committee placed the focus of current intelligence and infiltration work here. Lin Baiguang's mission was to use existing relationships to establish an intelligence network in Qiongzhou Prefecture, focusing on infiltrating the local government and garrison to grasp the garrison's status and movements.

Because Qiongshan County City was the seat of the prefecture, it was much larger than Lingao. The county seat was located at the foot of Daying Mountain and Bao'er Mountain, built along the mountain and water. The terrain was higher than the surroundings. The Meishe River flowed past its south and east gates, forming a natural moat, which had similarities to Lingao's city construction.

As this was the prefectural seat, and personnel and materials from the mainland mostly gathered and distributed here, commerce was quite prosperous. Many shops and households gathered on both sides of the main streets outside the East, West, and South gates, very lively. There were also handicraft workshops rarely seen in Hainan. Many simple primary industrial products could only be manufactured here on the entire Hainan Island. Therefore, the population and households here were much denser, and the streets bustling with activity looked a bit like ancient county towns in novels and movies.

However, once inside the county seat, similar to Lingao, few commercial and residential figures could be seen. Both sides of the main street were lined with various government offices: Qiongzhou Prefecture Yamen, Hainan Branch Surveillance Commissioner's Office, Branch Administration Commissioner's Office, Armament Bureau, Qiongzhou Prefecture School, Qiongshan County School... hardly any shadows of civilian houses could be seen, let alone commercial institutions. Only a market in the unwalled area outside the East Gate seemed quite lively. Lin Baiguang inquired and found this place was also called "East Gate Market."

Lin Baiguang was puzzled by this strange situation. Why was this dignified prefectural city so small in scale, leaving little area after being stuffed with various government offices? It was cold and cheerless, with almost no space left for residential and commercial districts. Instead, it was bustling outside the city, forming population settlements. He didn't know that there was a big difference between ancient cities in Hainan and those on the mainland: locally, people came before the city, meaning the city appeared after the population concentrated to a certain density; in Hainan, the city came before people. City building was for garrison and administrative needs. In other words, whether it was the Qiongzhou prefectural seat or the Lingao county seat, their essence was a military castle. The purpose of building the city was more for defense against attacks by indigenous people and bandits, demonstrating the Imperial Court's ruling power.

Slowly, such cities became guarantees of safety, and people gathered around the city, forming settlements. Because the city itself hadn't been planned for residents, the area was generally very small, making it difficult to accommodate the continuously increasing civilian houses. So even the hometowns of Qiongshan County's famous figures, Qiu Jun and Hai Rui, were outside the West Gate.

The transmigrator group already had a foothold at Shenying Port outside Qiongshan County City: an inn opened by Qiewei. In addition to guest rooms, it also had a large-scale warehouse attached and a ticket agency for Gaoguang Shipping. The target customers were merchants purchasing local products on the island. Various local products they bought on Hainan Island could be temporarily stored here, then shipped through Gaoguang Shipping. Because the procedures were convenient and transport secure, one-third of the goods currently exported from Qiongshan were carried by Gaoguang Shipping vessels.

Lin Baiguang felt that staying at the inn was too far from the city and inconvenient. So he took his subordinates and stayed at a small temple outside the city in the guise of a merchant—this kind of temple was small in scale, but the accommodation and food were cleaned very fastidiously. Not only was it convenient to live in, but it was also very quiet, perfectly acting as a "high-class hotel" of that time.

He was generous with money, throwing out ten taels of silver upon arrival to book a small courtyard. After settling down, he set up the portable 20W radio and established radio contact with the base station in Lingao. Every day he went out for a stroll to "visit" guests according to a list.

Calling it a "visit" wasn't quite accurate. Some were genuine visits, submitting a card at the door to request a meeting; others were merely inquiring about news on the periphery, not truly seeking a meeting.

These people were of all trades and professions. The list Lin Baiguang held was actually the relationship network in Qiongshan County deciphered and compiled from Gou Da and Gou Er's documents. He prepared to take over this system.

Lin Baiguang circled about twenty people on the list of those who had cooperative dealings with the Gou family—there was no need to take over the entire relationship network. According to the transmigrator group's plan, they would occupy the entire Hainan Island by the end of the first five-year plan. By then, they would be the rulers of Qiongshan County.

The people he selected included petty clerks in the government, junior officers in the local garrison, seated merchants operating shops, and traveling merchants moving between the mainland and Qiongshan. They were all people who could give the transmigrator group great assistance in intelligence and trade in the coming years.
