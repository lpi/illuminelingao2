# Chapter 387 - The Livestock Farm

Zhang Youfu thought it over: "There's one method, though somewhat troublesome—won't be done quickly."

"As long as we get the land, I'm willing to wait longer." Wu Nanhai said. Just completed before autumn.

"Then wait for my news." Zhang Youfu requested over 200 taels of silver from Wu Nanhai, then circulated around the major field plains near the county town. After ten-plus days, he managed to buy 70 *mu* of paddy land. Then he used the deed to trade for the disputed plot.

Seeing this result, the Agricultural Committee members didn't know whether to laugh or cry. During negotiations, the transmigrator collective had offered 200 taels of silver. If he didn't want silver, the Committee had also proposed in-kind exchanges of equal value. The old man had rejected everything. Why was he willing the moment someone offered a land deed?

"He just wanted to be a landlord. Now we're giving him landlord status—naturally he agreed." Zhang Youfu was quite pleased.

"We were willing to pay! He could buy land with money."

"The bumpkin hasn't seen the world—just afraid of being cheated." Zhang Youfu said dismissively. Urban-rural differences were quite severe.

"I see." Wu Nanhai nodded. Apparently this down-and-out local who'd survived as a county-town middleman had his talents.

"Traditional farmers' mentality is truly incomprehensible." Ye Yuming had exclaimed at the time.

"Past farmers hadn't seen the world, lacked education, were frequently cheated. High wariness is normal. Rural work is indeed difficult."

To Zhang Youfu, more incomprehensible were these "cropped-head bandits." They had both power and influence—direct seizure wouldn't have fazed the landlord. Even the county government would never offend the cropped-heads over such a pauper.

Such methods were simply called "winning hearts." But Zhang Youfu sensed it wasn't so simple.

This land, acquired through much effort and cost, was south of the farm. The Wenlan River had a small backwater here, forming a large shallow area with abundant reeds. Flat terrain, nearby rolling hills, convenient water access—after surveying, Wu Nanhai and Yang Baogui felt it suited a formal livestock facility.

The new facility had two sections: livestock and poultry. Wu Nanhai loved visiting here—not just for work, but the immense sense of accomplishment each visit brought. Especially after the circumnavigation voyage opened more resource acquisition channels. Bo-pu had started regular shipping to Changhua and Yulin. Large numbers of cattle and sheep from Changhua rapidly expanded breeding populations. Everyone's favorite meat—pigs—had also increased. By his estimate, next year transmigrators could at least restore 21st-century cosmic-power national per-capita meat consumption standards.

Wu Nanhai first visited the horse corral. Yang Baogui was recently learning riding from Nick—he found his buttocks too sore from bicycle jolts on dirt roads, the seat pressing painfully on his perineum.

"I don't want prostate problems from cycling—I'm a married man." So Yang Baogui had started learning horseback riding for future outings. Nick promised him a Yunnan pony for outings—payment for treating the horses.

When Wu Nanhai came looking, Nick said Yang Baogui had gone to the poultry area to supervise hatching facility construction.

This large hatching facility was built to support the Heaven and Earth Society's poultry promotion plan. Artificial egg incubation had appeared early in China and was widespread by Ming times—not breakthrough transmigrator technology. But artificial incubation wasn't popular in Lingao. Though chickens, ducks, and geese were common local poultry, farming scale was small, with no such demand.

Traditional artificial incubation methods varied widely. Most common were northern *kang*-incubation and East China jar-incubation. Wu Nanhai wasn't trained in animal husbandry; he'd consulted Yang Baogui, who had extensive field experience serving farmers.

Yang Baogui recommended northern *kang*-incubation. This method used simple equipment with large capacity—very suitable for large-scale farming needs. With skilled technique, hatch rates reached 80-90%, comparable to modern electric incubation. A standard seven-flue *kang* workshop could hold 2,600 chicken eggs at once, hatching 15,000 monthly. Expansion was simple, requiring almost no modern equipment or materials. Adobe bricks' insulation suited hatcheries better than fired bricks.

When Wu Nanhai arrived at the construction site, Yang Baogui was directing work. This new hatchery had slight improvements: tiled roof and brick-clad exterior walls—after all, in Lingao, pure adobe houses wouldn't last long.

"Feels somewhat wasteful." Wu Nanhai looked at this crude building under construction. He worried where he'd find 2,600 fertile eggs per batch. With eggs scarce and fertile embryos' brief storage life, collected fertile eggs were all naturally incubated by hens.

"Won't be wasteful. Rainy season always requires drying work—this hatchery can double as a drying room."

Yang Baogui reassured him not to worry: "The first batch being brooded now can provide about 200 chicks—enough for twenty smallholders. Batch sizes will gradually increase. It's a gradual process. Think how many chickens we had when we first moved here? Now over a hundred. Growth rate is several thousand percent. With mass mobilization, we might need expansion by year's end."

"Take me to see the henhouse."

"Alright. Let me give them some instructions first." Yang Baogui checked the site. The most critical *kang* flues were basically complete—this part was key. Well-built *kang* saved fuel and transmitted heat quickly; poor ones neither heated nor drew smoke. A specialized craft. Lingao naturally had no *kang* builders, not even among immigrants. They worked entirely from books and blueprints. He gave instructions to the foreman, then led Wu Nanhai to the recently-completed henhouses.

The new henhouse still used bamboo fence walls and fishing-net enclosures for free-range, with climbing vegetables as shelter. The new henhouse implemented separate housing. Breeding chickens were individually penned; layers, chicks, and growers each had their own spaces, mutually undisturbed, facilitating different feed additions by condition. Finally there were bronze turkeys—now expanded to about a dozen.

Around 200 growers were active in the spacious area under netting. They looked healthy. The ground had just been watered, smelling of lime.

"Daily scheduled manure cleaning, then lime-water disinfection. No choice—density's still high. Must prevent disease. Besides, chicken manure is also feed—can't waste it."

"We're not raising fish, are we?"

Chickens' short digestive tracts meant droppings still contained many nutrients. Wu Nanhai knew of circular agriculture raising chickens by fishponds, feeding fish with chicken manure.

"For pigs."

"Ugh, disgusting." The thought of chicken manure's stench already killed Wu Nanhai's interest.

"After fermentation, pigs actually love it." Yang Baogui smiled wryly. "Honestly I don't like this feeding method either. Once feed is plentiful, we'll just use it as fertilizer."

Wu Nanhai followed him to the duck shelter. Ducks were actually more profitable than chickens in poultry farming. Ducks were omnivorous poultry capable of self-foraging while grazing, tolerating rough feed with high feed conversion. During spring's first rice planting, Fa Shilu had experimentally practiced paddy-duck integration—letting ducks forage in rice paddies. Not only could they utilize field snails and small fish, but they also eliminated pests and weeds. Fa Shilu planned to drive ducks in after rice harvest to clear fallen grains and chaff—far more convenient and thorough than manual clearing. In Japan this had a nice name: "duck method rice cultivation"—a retro-style all-natural rice farming method.

The duck shelter was by the river bend. Bamboo fencing separated the backwater from the river channel, with an openable gate to prevent ducks from wandering off. Reeds were dense here, river water nutrient-rich. The riverbank had abundant snails and other aquatic creatures ducks loved. The Agricultural Committee had found a duck herder among immigrants to take the ducks out daily, also collecting snails and clams, crushing them for duck feed.

"Don't step randomly." Yang Baogui warned him—especially avoid stepping in riverside grass. Ducks might have laid eggs anywhere there; evenings the herder would patrol and collect eggs.

"We now have over 200 ducks, plus 30-some geese. Ducks and geese save more feed than chickens—besides laying poultry needing protein supplements, most use green feed. Egg production is decent too. Also suitable for promotional farming."

Ducks were local varieties and Beijing ducks from modern times. Yang Baogui planned to crossbreed them and see results. As for geese—transmigrators hadn't brought any since China's native goose breeds were recognized as excellent. He'd simply bought several from the market—the common South China lion-head goose.

Wu Nanhai said: "Duck and goose farming requires water surfaces—raising conditions are limited, not as easy to promote as chickens. Plus duck and goose eggs aren't popular. Everyone prefers chicken eggs. Who wants to eat duck eggs if they're not preserved or salted? Have you ever eaten goose eggs?"

"I've had wine-fermented goose eggs—quite tasty." Yang Baogui recalled that delicious memory.

"Poultry just grows fast. If only pigs could reproduce so efficiently."

"Pig reproduction isn't bad either. Sows can produce twenty piglets in two litters yearly. With good care, survival rates are quite high." Yang Baogui said. "The biggest problem is lack of sows."
