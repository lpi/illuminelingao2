# Chapter 254: Arrival at Changhua

Right then, without withholding anything, he taught the method of using the sextant. The use of the sextant was more convenient and accurate. Li Huamei, who sailed perennially, couldn't put it down after trying it out.

"Such a useful thing, truly rare." When returning the sextant to Chen Haiyang, she was reluctant to part with it. "Can you sell one to me?"

"Later," Chen Haiyang said. "We still have difficulties manufacturing them ourselves."

"Is that lens hard to make?"

"That's right," Chen Haiyang said while guiding the students to use it in turn. "Grinding the lenses ourselves isn't easy."

Li Huamei sighed: "Sigh, you have so many good things, but you just won't sell them."

"Watch the landing point of the light spot, hold your hand steady. Correct!" Chen Haiyang didn't answer. Which things could be sold—that was up to the Executive Committee.

"I have a feeling." Li Huamei leaned close to Chen Haiyang and said, "You people know everything, you just won't say!" The distance between the two was so close he could feel the woman's breath blowing against his hair roots, causing goosebumps to rise on his skin. The good impression he had originally felt cooled down again. He didn't reply, but shouted loudly at the students:

"Begin measuring navigation speed!"

Hearing the command, the students formed groups of three. One person threw a small wooden board out of the ship; one side of this board was wrapped in lead sheet so it would stand upright after hitting the water. Another student held a retractable reel, connecting the board with a cord. The student throwing the board watched the board fall into the water. When the small board emerged from the wake at the stern, he immediately shouted:

"Start!"

The student holding the reel began to release the cord. The reel spun rapidly, and the cord was continuously paid out. Meanwhile, the student holding the hourglass immediately flipped his hand, and the fine sand began to flow down quickly.

"Stop!" As the sand in the hourglass ran out, the timekeeper shouted the command to stop. The line holder jammed the reel.

"3 knots!" The line holder reported based on the markings on the cord. "Current sailing speed, 3 knots."

Chen Haiyang observed whether their movements met the standards. He nodded: "Good, next group!"

Li Huamei looked at them and said, "Your seamanship was definitely learned from the English."

"Why?"

"Only English sailors use this method."

A ship speed of 3 knots was considered a normal sailing speed for sailboats. Although slightly slow, it was safe. The Chinese sailing guides and charts in their hands were all drawn based on 20th-century data; the situation along the Hainan coast in this timeline was still a blank.

The sun gradually slanted westward, the wind force began to increase, and the waves grew larger. The measured speed had already reached 5 knots. Lin Chuanqing, worried, grabbed the walkie-talkie hanging around his neck and asked:

"Lookout, lookout, how is the sea surface situation?"

"Everything normal," Huang Zhuazi, who was responsible for the lookout at the top of the mast, replied. From the top of the mast, the field of view was unusually wide, and of course, the swaying was particularly severe. From the masthead, he could see quite a few ships nearby, mostly fishing boats, with occasional large vessels sailing under full sail. Overall, it was peaceful.

"How is it? Can you handle it up there?"

"No problem, the scenery is good up here, the air is good, haha." Huang Zhuazi adapted particularly well.

"How are the cloud conditions?"

"Altocumulus, moving from east to west."

This indicated perfectly normal weather; there wouldn't be any storms.

"Ruan Xiaowu, you climb up and join Instructor Huang on lookout!"

The child called Ruan Xiaowu looked a bit scared, but still stepped out, grabbed the rope net on the mast, and climbed upward.

The first day passed smoothly. Under the breeze, the fleet traveled about 40 nautical miles at a speed of 3 knots per hour. Since they were navigating along the coast, night sailing carried the danger of hitting reefs. Near 18:00, Lin Chuanqing found a desolate bay by the shore to spend the night. He calculated the local coordinates: 19°44’0”N, 109°9’0”E. Creating a map check, this place was exactly the location of Yangpu Port in Danzhou.

Yangpu was one of the top deep-water ports in western Hainan. In this timeline, it appeared empty and desolate. The bay was huge, crisscrossed with some sandbars. In the distance, one could see several sailboats docked by the shore, and a small fishing village.

After lowering a rowboat to sound the depth and determine the channel and anchorage, the *Zhenhai* lowered its outboard motors and towed the *Hangzhou* behind it, carefully entering the port at low speed.

Li Huamei stood on the quarterdeck, watching the churning water below: so this was the reason they didn't mount many guns. It seemed that iron ships weren't the only ones that could sail without sails or oars; wooden ships could too. This was achieved because they installed something on the ship. And this thing should be in some compartment right under her feet...

Wang Luobin decided to stay in Yangpu for a day or two. Yangpu was the deep-water port with the most development value in western Hainan. It was a port the future Transmigrator Regime would focus on developing, so gathering more information about this place was necessary. He immediately ordered the assault team to go ashore, control the situation, and replenish some food and water while they were at it.

Looking through the telescope, the coast of Yangpu was extremely desolate, but there was a fishing village by the shore. The Special Reconnaissance Team (SRT) took the marine detachment ashore in rowboats and immediately stormed the village. The entire village had no more than a dozen households, and more than half had already fled—as soon as they saw strange ships entering the port, the local fishermen ran, leaving only a few old and weak people who bowed and scraped when they saw them arrive. Fortunately, they spoke the Lingao dialect. Through locally recruited marines, the transmigrators learned they were begging not to have their houses burned or boats seized, saying just take the fish if wanted.

Xiong Buyou from the Foreign Affairs Department comforted them with kind words, saying they were only ashore to replenish some water and food, and would pay for everything taken. He also gave gifts like sewing needles and white sugar, pacifying the elders. Meanwhile, rowboats continued to ferry people ashore: the transmigrators, having been tossed about all day, were now recovering slightly. The feeling of seasickness passed, and their appetites returned. So they all schemed to go ashore for a walk. Some even proposed going ashore to hunt and get some meat. They also wanted to see if there were fish, vegetables, and eggs to purchase in the village. Wang Luobin thought that since they were going to delay in Yangpu for a day or two anyway, he might as well let everyone go ashore.

After the marine detachment went ashore, they quickly controlled the whole village, ignoring those who had already fled. They quickly set up temporary shelters next to the fishing village using tents and barbed wire, and sent observation posts to nearby high ground, settling down for the time being.

The amateur hunters conducted a disheartening hunt on shore. The local area could be said to have three abundances: abundant wasteland, abundant stones, and abundant cacti. Under these "three abundances," there basically wasn't even a hare to shoot, and wild vegetables were naturally nonexistent. After wandering for half the day, they basically returned empty-handed.

That night, Chen Haiyang had to continue comparing astronomical measurement techniques with Li Huamei in the middle of the night. She demonstrated on-site how to use the quadrant. The students were tongue-tied at the huge difference between the data obtained from the quadrant and the sextant. Although the error rate was less than 5%, less than 0.1 degree, converted into distance, it was 9 kilometers. In the vast ocean, this bit of error was enough to cause many fatal mistakes. No wonder early navigators preferred to sail along the coast—after all, landmark measurements on the coast were more accurate.

The next day, the exploration team members surveyed part of the bay, and the Navy measured the water depth, selecting several berths. The survey of the surrounding natural environment concluded that the local area was extremely barren, with basically no large natural rivers, making access to water difficult. Arable land was scarce, and trees were even scarcer.

"If the industrial water problem can be solved, this would be a good place for industrial development. It doesn't occupy farmland at all, nor does it destroy the environment." Wang Luobin sighed after the field investigation. "The environment is already bad enough."

Early on the third day, the fleet continued its departure. After several more days of such stop-and-go survey activities, finally, at noon on the fifth day, the ships arrived at the estuary of the Changhua River. Here, the Changhua River divided into north and south rivers to enter the sea. The south estuary was named Sanjia Port, and the north river wound south of the county seat to enter the sea, named Wuni Port, which was closer to the county seat. It was the main port of Changhua County.

However, from Lin Chuanqing's telescope, the northern Wuni Port was obviously unsuitable for anchoring. There was massive siltation, and apart from some small fishing boats, there was no sign of any ship docked there.

Li Huamei was quite familiar with the hydrological conditions here: "Dock at Sanjia Port. A 400-liao ship would run aground in Wuni Port."

So the fleet changed course to dock at Sanjia Port on the south river. As the ships entered the harbor, they saw several villages on the shore, as well as some broken walls and ruins. It looked like it used to be an army garrison, now abandoned.

It was spring, the dry season, so the flow of the Changhua River was very small. Streaks of dry riverbed lay exposed, revealing snow-white fine sand and withered water weeds. The north bank of the Changhua River was a plain. The vegetation by the river was mostly severely destroyed, forming a withered tropical savanna environment similar to the African grasslands. There were sand dunes in many places, extending far inland.

At the end of the plain was a set of rolling hills with relatively dense vegetation, estimated visually to be between 200 and 400 meters high. The south bank of the Changhua River was also a plain, with faint signs of paddy fields and a walled city—that should be the county seat of Changhua County of the Ming Dynasty.

"Where is the Haiwei Town quartz sand mine President Wen talked about?" Bai Guoshi asked. The Haiwei Town quartz sand mine was a key target of this exploration. The local quartz ore sand had a raw ore silica content of 99.8% and iron content of 0.1%, with few impurities and uniform particle size. It was rare in the whole country, and the reserves were huge.

"Isn't that it?" Wang Luobin pointed to the snow-white sand on the distant beach.

"Where's Haiwei Town? There should be a town—"

"This is 1629."

Wang Luobin ordered a small boat to be lowered. Several members of the exploration team rowed the sampan toward that beach. Before long, they brought back several rattan baskets of sand. Wang Luobin pinched some in his hand and examined it carefully. Under the sunlight, the sand in the center of his palm was as white as snow—truly good stuff! He naturally knew the value; such good quartz sand would be a waste to use for wine bottles and mirrors. It could also be used as raw material for circuit fuses, display screens, and the like.
