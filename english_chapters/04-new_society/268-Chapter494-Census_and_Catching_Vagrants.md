# Chapter 494 - Census and Catching Vagrants

Fu Yousan's family faced severe punishment. Not only was the entire farmstead confiscated—including land, grain, livestock, and people—but an equal area of the Fu family's fields was also seized. The village's formerly richest man fell to owning less than fifty *mu* of land, barely the level of a middle peasant household.

Not long after, Fu Yousan went mad—his fortune was destroyed, and his patriarchal authority collapsed with it. The resentment his three sons had accumulated over the years erupted. Since there was no longer any possibility of inheriting property, no one paid attention to Fu Yousan's patriarchal style anymore. Fu Erzhuang and Sanzhuang simply took their wives and children, left Meiyang Village, and went to Bairun City to be recruited as workers. Fu Yizhuang left him alone in the backyard, ignoring him except for providing some food and drink.

Checking the land yielded the biggest benefit for Fu Buer. The fall of Fu Yousan's family allowed him to ascend to the throne of the village's richest man. Moreover, according to Wu De's instructions, Wang Ruixiang was to cultivate new interest groups in the village appropriately as the cornerstone of the new regime. A rural small landlord like Fu Buer, willing to accept new things and possessing strong ambition, was a suitable target to win over. Therefore, great regard was shown to Fu Buer. Not only was his banquet invitation accepted, but it was also announced at the banquet that the county yamen would send him a plaque reading "Devoted to Public Service and Law-Abiding." This flushed Fu Buer's face with excitement—such an honor was rare not just in this village, but perhaps enjoyed by few in the whole county.

Besides honor, the more tangible benefit was a special permit issued by Wang Ruixiang, exempting him from one year of Divine Society service fees.

Fu Buer's status in the village immediately rose tremendously. The villagers viewed him as the Australians' agent in the village, so he quickly became a man of his word. Of course, he also became one of the transmigrator group's most loyal running dogs.

Subsequent surveying work in nearby villages became much easier: the events in Meiyang Village quickly spread. Now everyone knew the Australians had "iron birds" flying in the sky with "Thousand-Li Eyes" that could see everything. Many who had concealed land during the declaration were restless.

Wang Ruixiang seized the opportunity to send people everywhere to publicize the "voluntary surrender" policy. Any household that had concealed land during the self-declaration phase could "confess broadly" by coming to the work team in time. If they were discovered through investigation, not only would the concealed land be confiscated, but double the amount would be seized.

As soon as this news spread, an endless stream of households came to the work team's station to "surrender." Wang Ruixiang was very satisfied with this effect. Now he didn't need to go out and roar or threaten those poor wretches anymore—it was mentally exhausting. He had another thing to do—a census.

Exactly how large was Lingao County's population? This was a question no one in the county could answer clearly. According to the county's Yellow Registers retrieved from the Household Office, there were 6,231 registered households, of which 4,795 were civilian households, while the rest were military households, corvée households, horse station households, and various other categories, each bearing different taxes and labor services. The total population was 33,282, with males accounting for more than two-thirds and only just over 4,000 women.

This figure was hard for the Executive Committee to believe. While it was a fact that the local population wasn't flourishing, based on what everyone saw daily, it definitely wasn't that sparse. Clearly, a large number of "hidden households" existed.

Wu De specifically called Zhou Qi for consultation. Zhou Qi told them their guess wasn't wrong; indeed, many "hidden households" existed, purely to evade taxes and labor service. As for the household population figures, the county yamen's records were basically a mess. The numbers published in these Yellow Registers were statistics from the seventh year of Zhengde.

"Ever since the Single Whip Method was implemented in the Wanli era, and grain taxes were collected and transported by officials without needing the *li-jia* system to handle them," Zhou Qi explained, "these Yellow Registers have long been useless. They say they're revised every ten years, then later said every year, but since this stuff can't be used for tax collection or conscripting corvée labor, the Household Office just copies the previous numbers every year and makes an estimate. Look—" He flipped through a few books at the back for Wu De to see, and there was actually a Yellow Register for the tenth year of Tianqi. Clearly, it had been "pre-fabricated." This administrative style and concept made Wu De laugh despite himself. It seemed many abuses were truly inherited.

"So that's how it is." Wu De nodded. "It's better to restore the Yellow Registers now."

"Yes, yes," Zhou Qi agreed, wondering what the use of restoring the Yellow Registers was. The thing had long been a mere formality.

With Zhou Qi's experience, he couldn't yet comprehend the significance of a census. Another important institution of the transmigrator group, the household registration system, also had to be built on the basis of a census. The Ming Dynasty's household registration system had once been very rigorous, but by now it had collapsed into shambles. The transmigrator group planned to transplant a system that had been effective in another timeline here.

Implementing a new household registration system would inevitably involve establishing a grassroots administrative system. This would be a prolonged task consuming vast manpower and material resources. To grasp the county's population status as quickly as possible and push the next step of the population development plan, the Executive Committee decided not to roll out the household registration system countywide for now, but to conduct a census first. For this, they created a population card system. Registration was done by individual. The card recorded only name, birth date, gender, education level, ethnicity, occupation, and residence. Each card had a unique 12-digit number, providing a foundation for implementing an ID card system in the future. Originally, they planned to paste photos on the cards, but since photos couldn't be printed for so many people yet, they switched to fingerprint collection. Based on the collected cards, summary population registers would be created by village for reference.

The census in Meiyang Village and several nearby villages was ending soon. leveraging the prestige of the "Iron Bird" and "Thousand-Li Eye," this census went very smoothly. Not a single person dared to evade registration. Rumor had it that if one didn't register and was seen by the Thousand-Li Eye, they would be caught for "labor reform."

The Thousand-Li Eye actually saw other things—during the aerial reconnaissance to investigate Meiyang Village's hidden fields, Wang Ruixiang discovered other things in the images: temporary shacks and small plots of land scattered deep in the hills. He even saw a ragged, unkempt man in one photo staring up with his mouth wide open in surprise.

"Vagrants, huh? Not easy living in such a hidden place." Wang Ruixiang muttered to himself, plotting the distribution of shacks on the map. He would give it to Huang Ande later to lead a team to "catch vagrants."

So-called "catching vagrants" was another matter in the census. Vagrants referred to two types of people in the county. One type was foreign refugees scattered in the wilderness, reclaiming small patches of wasteland to survive. Most of these refugees came from the coasts of Fujian and Guangdong, and some from Vietnam. To evade government taxes and corvée, they scattered in uninhabited hilly areas and mountains, reclaiming small pieces of land to grow minor crops for a living. Living days without enough clothes to cover their bodies or food to fill their bellies, they barely scraped by. When opportunity arose, they would also steal from nearby villages or band together for robbery.

The other type was the so-called "loafers" common in every village. Such people existed in larger villages, mostly engaging in no honest work, living by petty theft. Some also colluded with bandits for "big business" like robbery and kidnapping.

The transmigrator group believed that letting them continue like this was primarily a waste of labor and secondly a source of social instability. Therefore, simultaneous with the census, a unified operation was conducted to collect and arrest both types. The former would be purified according to immigrant procedures and distributed to communes; the latter would be exiled to labor reform camps for forced labor at hard labor.

"There really are quite a few 'black people'." Wang Ruixiang thought, looking at the speckled marks on the map. He wondered how many more such settlements existed. Some settlements had been discovered during reconnaissance operations by long-range exploration teams and special recon teams, but the undiscovered ones were surely the majority. Just the number of population cards registered in Meiyang Village was about eighty more than the Household Office's figures—with hundreds of villages in the county, who knew how many such black households there would be in total? It seemed Lingao's population potential was far from being tapped.

"Ensure you catch every single one." Wang Ruixiang stared at Huang Ande's face. "You only have ten men. You can't alert others during the arrest, or it'll be troublesome if they run. Understand?"

"Yes!" Huang Ande replied loudly. He already had a draft for how to catch people—surprise attack tactics. When he was a soldier in the Ming army, he heard soldiers who had been to Liaodong say: their first fear was field battles; their second was serving as night sentries. Standing guard on enemy towers in pitch darkness, if Tartars sneak up quietly—you either lost your head or got captured alive.

In the NCO training class, he had mastered new weapons and new tactics that neither the Ming army nor the Tartars possessed. Huang Ande was now ready to try his hand and see how these Australian surprise attack tactics really worked.

After accepting the order, Huang Ande gathered his soldiers. He was currently just an infantry squad leader; his deputy was his old partner Qian Duo. Qian Duo had mediocre abilities, passing in all aspects, and had become a corporal and deputy squad leader by virtue of seniority as the army expanded.

Holding a pre-battle meeting before action, assigning tasks, discussing details, and boosting morale—these were rules in the Australian army. Huang Ande originally thought them superfluous—soldiers just needed to charge with swords and spears in formation.

He discovered that the Australian army particularly advocated "subjective initiative" in soldiers and lower-level officers. While emphasizing obedience to orders and discipline, it also required them to have their own views on how to fight better and the ability to handle various sudden situations.

Over time, he began to appreciate the benefits—in any situation, soldiers knew what they should do, rather than standing dumbfounded or dispersing in a chaotic swarm.
