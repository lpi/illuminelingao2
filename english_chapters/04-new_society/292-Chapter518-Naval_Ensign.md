# Chapter 518 - Naval Ensign

The sailors finished scrubbing the deck and mopped the wet planking dry. The entire surface was mirror-bright, without a speck of dust or debris. Ruan Xiaowu, as the day's duty officer, inspected the deck.

Following the regulations laid down by Director Wen, the Navy's supreme adviser, he removed his shoes and paced the length of the deck in a pair of white cloth socks freshly put on that morning.

The sailors knew that if he lifted a foot and found grayish-black traces on the sole, the entire deck would have to be scrubbed again. Every ship moored in harbor was required to meet this standard—also a regulation from Director Wen. Director Wen's concern for naval affairs had reached a level the sailors found "hair-raising." Beyond setting the standard, he had also designed a complete deck-cleaning protocol. For example, mopping was governed by explicit procedures: two buckets had to be used, one marked "Clean" and one marked "Dirty." The mop was first rinsed in the dirty bucket and wrung as dry as possible before being dipped into the clean bucket—taking care not to absorb too much water—and then applied to the deck. After a certain number of square meters, the dirty bucket was emptied; the clean bucket became the dirty bucket; and a new clean bucket was brought forward… the rotation continuing in sequence.

As Wang Dahuzi had once remarked while drunk: "The Navy is a place where even farting has a regulation."

After walking the length of the deck, Ruan Xiaowu's socks remained as white as before. Satisfied, he put his shoes back on and logged the deck's condition in the handbook. He then announced that deck cleaning was complete. Only then did the sailors, still holding buckets, mops, and brushes in readiness, begin stowing the cleaning gear. Ruan Xiaowu proceeded to inspect deck equipment. As the ship's gunnery officer, he paid particular attention to weapons.

Owing to the original hull structure, all of *Linyun 7*'s gun positions were on deck. Deck-mounted guns were more exposed to salt spray and seawater, placing high demands on maintenance. Each cannon had to be kept spotlessly clean in the bore, and not a trace of rust was permitted on the barrel.

He checked each gun's muzzle and barrel in turn, inspecting the touchhole for fouling or corrosion. He tested the gun-carriage wheels for sluggish rolling and felt around the axles to verify that lubricant had been applied according to regulations. Finally, he inspected the condition of the block-and-tackle assemblies and ropes secured to the gunwales for checking recoil—as the ship's gunnery officer, he had to ensure that all weapons were in peak condition.

He also tested whether the two newly installed "Typewriters" traversed and elevated smoothly. This entirely new weapon had only recently been issued. Ruan Xiaowu had witnessed its power during his time as a cadet aboard the patrol boat. With this device on the poop deck, any enemy attempting to grapple and board would be slaughtered outright. Even fire ships—that ultimate attack method that pirates and Ming troops alike dreaded and even the red-haired foreigners feared—were no longer terrifying. No crew could steer a vessel close enough to ram when the helmsmen would all be cut down by the "Typewriter" at a hundred meters away.

The weapon was, however, not yet easy to employ. The gunner needed great strength to hold the barrel on target; a first-time shooter usually sprayed rounds into the sky or the deck. Ruan Xiaowu himself had practiced for a long time in the training detachment before mastering the trick of controlling muzzle climb, then taught the technique to the members of his gun crew.

After the inspection was complete, the gunners covered and secured the weapons with tung-oil–treated waterproof canvas.

He glanced at the hourglass and scale beside the helm on the poop deck. In half an hour, the captain would come on deck for inspection. After that, breakfast.

But last night all the captains here had been summoned to Navy headquarters at the harbor for a meeting. Ruan Xiaowu knew the Navy was about to undertake a major mission; the specifics might well be announced today.

As to what the orders were, Ruan Xiaowu had no idea—even the captain did not know. *Linyun 7*'s captain, Qian Changshui, was one of the earliest pirates to defect to the Australians—captured during Liu Xiang's night raid on Bopu. After vetting, he had been deemed "redeemable" and taken on as a sailor. Because of his outstanding performance and diligent study, he had been recommended for the Naval-Studies Course One at the Military-Political School, becoming one of the first indigenous personnel to be promoted to naval officer—and the first cohort to serve as ship's captain. In the old days, he had commanded only a battered sampan; now he was captain of a 200-ton ship, strutting about the deck every day in a uniform with officer's braid, issuing orders with an air of authority. Ruan Xiaowu envied him greatly—when would he himself become a captain?

Still, that was rather wishful thinking. He would only be sixteen after the lunar New Year. Was there such a thing as a sixteen-year-old captain? Then again, he was already a naval officer cadet with candidate-officer status, gunnery officer of a large ship, and among the top one or two in Naval-Studies Course Two. As for his future prospects… At the thought, his lips curled into a grin.

Qian Changshui returned, smiling broadly, and clapped him on the shoulder—an informality at odds with military protocol that startled Ruan Xiaowu. Qian Changshui was normally the consummate officer type; when had he become so friendly?

"Congratulations, lad!" Qian Changshui said. "You're about to become a captain!"

"What?!" Ruan Xiaowu's eyes went wide. A captain? A sixteen-year-old captain?

"Don't gape like you're trying to swallow a watermelon." Qian Changshui was suddenly very warm toward him. "Come, let's talk in the captain's cabin."

Ruan Xiaowu, still dazed, reached the captain's cabin on the poop deck before he came back to his senses. Qian Changshui told him: *Linyun 7* had received orders; in another week, she would set sail on a mission. He, too, had been promoted to captain and would soon be transferred off *Linyun 7*.

"You'll probably get a special-duty vessel," Qian Changshui said. "Not big, but at least it's a ship! You'll be the old man aboard! Such a young captain—that's a first on these waters! The orders will be delivered shortly. Get your quarters squared away, change your clothes, and prepare to go to the Sacred Ship to receive your new commission."

A messenger arrived with orders for him to attend the promotion ceremony aboard the Sacred Ship. *Fengcheng* was now called "the Sacred Ship" in standard "new speak"; it was the transmigrated collective's holy ground—and the Navy's holy ground as well. Naval headquarters occupied part of *Fengcheng*'s compartments. Owing to its comfortable facilities, it was nicknamed "Fengcheng Hotel" and also called "the Dock Queen"; jokers termed it "Lingao's Yamato."

Ruan Xiaowu had once gone aboard "the Sacred Ship" as a naval trainee for observation and study. The vessel's majesty had so excited the three Ruan brothers—then still trainees—that they could not sleep for days. From that moment on, they had resolved to follow the Australians to the end.

The moment he set foot on the gangway, a golden-haired foreign woman popped up from somewhere, aiming a black object at him and clicking away. Ruan Xiaowu already knew this thing was called a "camera"—used for taking "portraits." Photographs appeared from time to time in the *Lingao Times* they read every day; this was how they were made. Ruan Xiaowu no longer fled in terror at the sight of a camera and had learned to smile for it.

He stared at the large bosom bouncing beneath the foreign woman's close-fitting blouse, blushed crimson, and quickly ducked his head to pass.

"Look up! The fifteen-year-old captain!" the foreign woman called with a loud laugh. People on deck also laughed. Ruan Xiaowu was even more embarrassed; he hurried toward the cabins in double time.

The promotion ceremony was imposing. In *Fengcheng*'s banquet hall, the "Warship March" blared from a loudspeaker. More than a hundred naval trainees from the Military-Political School's officer-cadet program stood in formation. The ceremony for this second cohort of ensigns was underway. On the dais sat Chen Haiyang, People's Commissar of the Navy; Director Wen Desi, Supreme Adviser to the Navy; and other senior transmigrator naval officers.

This was the Navy's second indigenous-officer promotion. To foster a sense of honor and reinforce loyalty among indigenous servicemen, both the Army and the Navy held solemn ceremonies for every promotion.

"There's really nothing unusual about it. If these ensigns don't get killed or prove utterly hopeless, they should all be lieutenant generals or full admirals in twenty years. A bit of pomp and circumstance is only fitting," Ma Qianzhu had always supported such "martial splendor" activities, both in spirit and materially.

This time, however, he did not attend the Navy's promotion ceremony. He felt his appearance rate was already high enough: he had attended three of the Army's four ceremonies and one of the Navy's—too much exposure invited gossip.

Chen Haiyang read out the names of the ten newly promoted naval ensigns one by one. Most were from Naval-Studies Course One, though a few were from Course Two, like Ruan Xiaowu.

Those called stepped onto the dais one by one, receiving their officer's commissions from Chen Haiyang and their naval officer's short swords from Wen Desi. Although the simple cotton Year-One naval uniforms looked a bit comical with a short sword hanging from them, the naval transmigrators had insisted on issuing this symbolic weapon—because the Army awarded commanding-officer sabers at its commissioning ceremonies, and if the Army had them, the Navy certainly could not go without.

"Naval-Studies Course Two, Ruan Xiaowu!" Chen Haiyang's unaided voice was full and resonant. "Awarded the rank of naval ensign! Chairman of the Executive Committee, Wen Desi; People's Commissar of the Navy, Chen Haiyang. December 1629."

Ruan Xiaowu jumped to his feet as if by reflex, walked on trembling legs up to the dais, and saluted. He received his commission from Chen Haiyang.

Then Wen Desi presented the officer's sword. Looking at this scrawny young man who seemed almost a child, Wen Desi knew he was the youngest of this cohort of ensigns—a young man destined to be a pillar of the future imperial navy. No wonder the Propaganda Department planned to use him as the subject of a major publicity campaign.

"Congratulations," Wen Desi said.

"Thank you, Director Wen!" The sight of Director Wen—whom indigenous people revered almost as a god and who seldom appeared—offering him personal congratulations moved Ruan Xiaowu to brimming tears.

For the first time in his life, Wen Desi witnessed someone reduced to tears by a few words of his. His sense of leadership was greatly gratified.
