# Chapter 365 - The Foshan Journey (Part 14)

"Yes, I think this is a good opportunity for the Society to serve the court. I'm an old soldier myself—I've fought for over ten years in Europe. I haven't cast cannons, but I've fired them. I know the basic principles of artillery—I can help you."

"Excellent! And what about the cannon founders? There's no one here who knows how to cast Western cannons."

"The Portuguese won't give you their founders—requesting the Superior won't help. If you want people from Goa, you'll have to wait until next year."

"What shall we do then?" Li Luoyou had assumed that with Jesuit backing, hiring Portuguese founders would be straightforward. He hadn't expected they simply couldn't find anyone. He looked toward the Englishman.

"Don't look at me." Quark Qiong raised both hands. "The East India Company's founders are in India too—where would we find them here?" He produced a pipe, filled it with tobacco, and puffed away. "But I do have an idea."

"What idea?"

"Borrow cannons! Have the Jesuits negotiate to borrow a few cannons from the Portuguese. Let the craftsmen measure them in person, then cast copies to the same dimensions. I'd say there are no craftsmen in the world more skillful than the Chinese—show them the real thing, and they'll figure out how to make it."

This was a feasible approach. But borrowing cannons from the Portuguese required official permission from the government—it would need considerable maneuvering. Li Luoyou was confident about this; he had already arranged a marriage for his nephew with a strategist in Governor-General Wang Zunde's retinue. Through that connection, negotiating cannon-borrowing and casting shouldn't be too problematic.

"Borrowing cannons still requires the Macao Municipal Council's approval. The Jesuits can't command the Council."

"I think it will be fine. If Governor-General Wang Zunde issues an order, the Council won't dare refuse."

"But which cannons should we borrow?" Though enthusiastic, Li Luoyou was still an amateur.

"I think the twelve-pounders from last time would be suitable," Quark Qiong said. "I hear the Chinese army used them to kill the Tartar king."

"He was just a barbarian chieftain. Hardly a king!"

"For pure defense, such large-caliber cannons are certainly most suitable. But they can't be used in field battles." Ma Yangchun, being a veteran, had far more experience than average. "When infantry needs fire support, these cannons are too heavy. We must cast three-pounder and six-pounder cannons..." He noted that carts called carriages were needed to make them mobile in battle, enabling effective infantry support and cavalry defense.

Li Luoyou shook his head repeatedly—not disagreeing, but knowing the Ming military situation too well. Never mind lacking enough horses; even if they had them, weren't soldiers cheaper than horses? A soldier's monthly pay was only one or two taels; a horse cost dozens of taels. Equipping artillery teams as foreigners did would be unaffordable.

"Father, the court's demand for heavy cannons is great now. Besides, the court lacks horses."

"Not just war horses—even draft horses are inadequate." Ma Yangchun knew that in China, apart from the government, military, and a few wealthy people, horses were almost never seen. And the horses here were mostly small—he had initially thought the Chinese preferred using young horses, only later realizing otherwise.

"It seems we can only cast heavy cannons." Ma Yangchun considered. "But the largest in the Portuguese Macao batteries are only eighteen-pounders..."

"That's close enough. Transporting the twelve-pounders during the Tianqi reign cost enormous effort."

They decided to request the Macao Municipal Council loan eighteen-pounder, twelve-pounder, and six-pounder cannons, one of each. Gun carriages and mounts would also be borrowed for replication. Li Luoyou still harbored hope—surely Xu Guangqi, with his learning, would recognize the importance of light field artillery?

Li Luoyou took out his abacus and roughly calculated expenses to establish pricing baselines for future cannon contracts.

"With a foundry, I'll first preach the Gospel to the workers. Through them, I'll spread the Lord's word..." Ma Yangchun shifted from soldier back to priest. "Recently there's good news."

"What good news, Father?"

"The Lord's flock has grown. Do you remember Brother Lu Ruohua?"

"Of course—he escorted the cannons to the capital with the Portuguese."

"Not that one—that's Lu Ruohan." Ma Yangchun shook his head. "I mean Father Lu Ruohua, who went to Qiongzhou to spread the Gospel last year."

Li Luoyou vaguely remembered such a person. "John's missionary work there has achieved great results?"

"No, not John."

John was the famous Ming Catholic Wang Hongwei's son, baptized as John. Wang Hongwei and Xu Guangqi had been the Jesuits' main hopes for missionary work in the Great Ming.

Ma Yangchun held his rosary, eyes raised to heaven. "Truly a miracle! Thanks be to God! The miracle expected in Ding'an City of Hainan Island instead occurred in Lingao City. The Lord's will is truly mysterious."

He praised Lu Ruohua's missionary achievements in Lingao at great length: hundreds baptized, a church and monastery established. He enthusiastically declared the Australians on the island to be a pious flock devoted to spreading the Gospel.

"Lingao? Australians?" Li Luoyou's expression grew serious. Australian goods had been famous throughout Guangdong for a year now. And he had heard about Australians arriving on iron ships to land at Lingao, building fortresses just as the Portuguese had once done in Xiangshan Ao. But after landing, this group had remained quiet—apart from sending ships to trade in Guangzhou, selling various exotic wares and purchasing supplies, they hadn't done anything outrageous.

"Indeed—the Australians now in Lingao. I hear they've built a fortress there called Bairren." Ma Yangchun knew considerable detail because of Lu Ruohua.

"They probably want to repeat what the Portuguese did," Quark Qiong said. "Honestly, I'd quite like to see these strange people."

"I hear there are your countrymen among them," Ma Yangchun said with a smile. "Brother Lu says he met several English-speaking women."

"Australians like English women?" Quark Qiong laughed heartily. "I really should visit—it's been so long since I've tasted a female compatriot."

Ma Yangchun smiled. "Perhaps they're fond of the English. Brother Lu's letter says many of them know European languages, but almost everyone speaks English."

"That's truly strange." Quark Qiong's curiosity was piqued. "I can't imagine what use learning English would be for anyone outside England?"

In this era, intellectuals used Latin; common people used their own languages. French hadn't even spread to the French countryside. Yet here in the East was a group where everyone could speak some English—a phenomenon defying all social norms that no one could understand.

"God protect them—they're all believers in the Lord, and haven't fallen into heresy..." Ma Yangchun crossed himself, then earnestly addressed Quark Qiong. "Mr. Quark, the Lord's door is always open for lost sheep..."

"Father—" Quark Qiong knew another attempt was coming to convert him back to Catholicism from the Church of England. Faith or no faith made no difference to this Englishman. As he'd once said when drunk: if necessary, he could believe any religion at any time, or not believe at all. This Englishman didn't believe in God at all—a thorough "no King, no God" gold-worshipper who believed only in glittering gold.

"Let's not discuss this," Li Luoyou changed the subject. "Australian goods are exquisitely crafted; some seem European but even better. I'd very much like to see their craftsmanship."

"I'd like to see too," Quark Qiong said. "Trade with them directly. And see the legendary iron ships. But the Ming court won't let us travel inland. And the seas aren't safe."

Li Luoyou said, "Mr. Quark, if you wish, we can visit Lingao together next month. On my ship."

"Yes, I'll definitely go." Quark Qiong, always seeking new trade opportunities, accepted readily.

The three chatted late into the night before dispersing. The next morning, Li Luoyou first sent men with birthday gifts to the Lin residence, reaching an understanding with Lin Ming. Ma Yangchun began giving catechism lessons to several branch employees. Li Luoyou felt having his staff embrace the faith was beneficial—at least it gave them spiritual sustenance and prevented idle thoughts.

At dinner, Yang Shiyi came to visit. After the meal, the two closeted themselves in the study for a lengthy discussion, finalizing the ginseng deal. Yang Shiyi's smile nearly split his face—he was getting Li Luoyou's ginseng at sixty taels per *jin* and would wholesale it at one hundred taels. Retail prices approached two hundred taels per *jin*. He profited both wholesale and retail.

Quark Qiong had to stay confined in the trading house due to his appearance. Li Luoyou knew how to entertain foreign merchants—good food, good drink, and occasionally a woman for entertainment. Quark Qiong, far less particular than transmigrators, accepted everything with smiles. Besides eating, drinking, and enjoying, his other occupation was examining product samples that Manager Cheng collected daily from various shops, selecting styles Europeans would favor. Sometimes he would draw designs and patterns himself for custom orders.
