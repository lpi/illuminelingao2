# Chapter 252: The Expedition Departs

After Li Chiqi left, Wen Desi immediately convened a meeting of the Standing Committee. Regarding Li Chiqi's concerns, everyone looked at each other—this was truly hard to say. No one dared guarantee that such a thing wouldn't happen.

"So, what do we discuss?" Wen Desi asked. "Do we delay the departure by a few weeks and put the ship in drydock for a refit? Or do we leave as is?"

"That would take at least another month!" Wang Luobin had built ship models and understood ship performance very well. Adding power, whether screw propeller or paddle wheel, involved structural changes and a series of technical processes to figure out. Saying one month was being optimistic.

"I don't know much about ships," Ma Qianzhu used a deflection tactic before giving his opinion. "To be safe, naturally, going out with an engine modified in would be best; at least it insures personal safety. After all, transmigrators are our primary wealth. Otherwise, increase the firepower on the ship: one SKS per person, and add a few more cannons."

Wen Desi thought Ma Qianzhu's idea was a simple solution. A dozen SKS rifles firing together would have a fire density comparable to a machine gun.

"Semi-automatic rifles are nice, but there are at most thirty-some transmigrators on the *Zhenhai*. Unless everyone is a sharpshooter, being mobbed by seven or eight ships still means death," Chen Haiyang expressed his concern. "To ensure we hit targets outside the range of enemy cannons, the SKS and Type 56 semi-autos need to open fire at over 400 meters. Hitting targets at this distance requires considerable training. Most of the people going this time are technical staff; I am quite worried."

"Rockets!" Li Yunxing proposed his solution. "Our test rockets have achieved preliminary success, with an effective range of over 600 meters. Just a simple launcher—"

"Meaningless," Chen Haiyang dismissed it. "Rockets are okay for bombarding area targets on shore, but hitting point targets at sea is basically just setting off fireworks."

They discussed back and forth, but regarding how to foolproof the *Zhenhai*'s firepower, no one could come up with a steady plan.

"We're all idiots!" *Zhenhai*'s captain, Lin Chuanqing, slapped his forehead and shouted. "What power does the *Deng Yingzhou* rely on?"

"Diesel outboard motors!" Wang Luobin remembered. The so-called hanging paddle machine was an outboard motor, standard equipment on motorized sailing vessels. This was a modification that didn't require much surgery; two diesel outboard motors could be installed directly at the stern. Providing 50 horsepower would be a breeze. And it didn't require entering the drydock again; the modification work could all be done above the waterline.

"It consumes diesel." Ma Qianzhu heartache for the blood of industry.

"Maybe convert to a gas engine?"

"Forget it, don't mess with that in such a small space on the ship. The enemy won't have come, and you'll all be poisoned by carbon monoxide. We don't have a hyperbaric oxygen chamber here," Ma Qianzhu grunted. This counted as a choice of last resort.

"Actually, it won't use much diesel," Lin Chuanqing said. "It's a hybrid power system. Normally use sails, and only use the diesel engine when fighting or fleeing. With good luck, we might not need to use it."

The next day, part of the supplies on the ship were unloaded, and transmigrators from the machinery department climbed aboard to install two 17KW diesel outboard motors. During the installation, they discovered a new problem: the *Zhenhai* had a displacement of 170 tons, and its waterline was much higher than the 70-ton *Deng Yingzhou*, so the propellers couldn't reach the water.

Fortunately, this problem couldn't stump the mechanics fanatics. Since the length wasn't enough, they would lengthen it. However, someone soon discovered that simply lengthening the drive shaft resulted in significantly increased vibration, and the strength was compromised.

"How about cutting two portholes in the lower stern under the deck to install the outboard motors? That way the length fits," someone suggested.

"It's possible, but we have to touch the hull." Wen Desi looked at it for a long time. "We have to avoid the ribs and can only cut holes in the hull plating."

After the portholes were cut, the two outboard motors were installed on specially made iron frames, which were firmly fixed to the bottom deck. Because the portholes were too close to the waterline, water would easily splash in at high speeds, and the machines were prone to damage from long-term exposure to the seawater environment. Thus, the outboard motors used retractable propellers; they were lowered when in use and retracted, with the portholes closed, when not.

Tests showed that when using the outboard motors, the speed could easily reach 8 knots in windless conditions. However, when driving with the portholes open in moderate sea conditions, water splashing was severe, requiring continuous pumping with a water pump. For this, the machinery factory rushed to produce a set of sealing shields for use while underway, blocking the gaps around the machine as much as possible when the portholes were open. In the second test, water ingress still existed but was within an acceptable range.

The entire modification and testing were completed within two days. The unloaded cargo and supplies were reloaded onto the ship. This time, several hundred liters of diesel were added, enough for escape if necessary. The exploration team transmigrators were also issued extra modern firearms.

The fleet departed from Bopu. Their route was westward, to circumnavigate the entire Hainan Island and make a rough survey of the coastal terrain and resources.

For most transmigrators, this was their first attempt at sailing on such a small vessel. No matter how much Wen Desi tried to implement the principle of comfort, it couldn't compare to modern ships from their original timeline. Not long after the *Zhenhai* put to sea, people began to get seasick. After half a day, almost all the transmigrators were seasick. The bulwarks were crowded with transmigrators scrambling to "pay public grain" to the sea. In the end, they had nothing left to vomit and were helped back to their bunks by sailors and soldiers, exhausted and groaning. Only the Special Reconnaissance Team (SRT) and Navy personnel, seasoned by long-term training, had already adapted.

"You there, vomiting by the rail! Yes, talking to you! Hold onto the rope; if you fall in, there's no saving you!" Lin Chuanqing scolded a guy who was vomiting while he personally manned the helm on the quarterdeck. The *Zhenhai* used a Western-style steering wheel, utilizing gears and steel cables for transmission, making the rudder extremely light and responsive. For safety, the *Zhenhai* utilized a dual-backup system; in addition to the main wheel on the quarterdeck platform, there was a backup wheel inside the quarterdeck superstructure to ensure the ship could still be steered if one failed.

Over here, Meng De was leaning against the quarterdeck railing, looking pale and seemingly wishing for death. He was still clutching a sextant in his hand.

"Damn, you call yourself a navigation student?" Lin Chuanqing said dismissively.

"When we interned, we were on huge ships of thousands of tons—" Meng De retorted. "How was I to know I'd end up on a small boat like this one day?"

Lin Chuanqing said, "Heh heh heh, you just lack sea training. Look at that girl, she's stronger than you."

"That's not a fair comparison—" Meng De was about to continue but ran off to vomit again.

This level of sea state was naturally nothing to Li Huamei. Upon boarding the *Zhenhai*, she had expected to see new gadgets that would surprise her—just like the feeling she had when she boarded the "Holy Ship" that day. But looking around, aside from some novelty in the arrangement of the fore and aft gun positions, the whole ship was no different from the European two-masted ships she had seen, except it was more comfortable to live in. As for those two delicate little guns, in her opinion, they might as well not be there; the shells they fired were at most 6-pounders, and there were so few of them. Even the *Hangzhou* had 14 guns of various sizes.

She didn't know why the Australians wanted the fleet to circumnavigate Hainan. Hainan Island was quite familiar to sea merchants and pirates, especially the coastal bays. Almost all of them could be used for temporary anchorage to shelter from the wind, rest, and replenish fresh water. But the significance of this island ended there. No one was interested in the island's resources—it produced neither raw silk nor porcelain, nor any of the goods merchants were interested in. It was too poor, with too few people and nothing to sell. Yet the Australians' interest in it was so intense; what on earth for?

She looked up at the man steering the ship: square face, graying hair. He was wearing a tight-fitting blue and white horizontally striped shirt—people here often wore this kind of shirt, almost completely tight, collarless, with very short sleeves. He stood steadily on the quarterdeck with a look of utter indifference—a true sea dog.

"What is that?" She noticed the fan-like instrument in Meng De's hand.

"Sextant." Meng De was already dizzy and seeing stars from seasickness.

"Sextant?" Li Huamei intuitively knew this was an astronomical measuring instrument. But she had never seen one before.

Meng De was too dizzy to speak. He simply shoved the instrument into her hand and went back to vomiting on his own.

Lin Chuanqing, steadying the helm, said, "It's an instrument for measuring latitude."

"Is it?" Li Huamei looked at it curiously in her hand. "It looks like a quadrant?"

"Heh, I don't know what a quadrant is." Lin Chuanqing smiled. "Never played with one. What you're talking about is probably the ancestor of the sextant, right?"

Li Huamei was puzzled: "Ancestor?"

Lin Chuanqing realized his slip of the tongue and muttered ambiguously, "This is definitely easier to use than your quadrant."

It was the early 17th century. Navigators like Li Huamei customarily used the quadrant used by the late 16th-century English navigator John Davis, also known as the Davis Quadrant or back-staff, to measure the latitude of the earth while sailing. Quadrants, or "staff projectors," were rarely seen now, yet they were the greatest navigational invention of the 16th and 17th centuries. Their working principle was simple. Navigators didn't need to try to look at the sun as required when using an astrolabe or simple quadrant; instead, they used the shadow cast by a stick onto a scale. The position of the shadow's end indicated the sun's altitude, and thus latitude could be calculated. Navigators achieved the best results with the Davis Quadrant on calm seas when the deck was stable. Because its calculation was simple and accurate, latitude calculation advanced from degrees to minutes. It soon replaced instruments like the astrolabe and cross-staff of the past.
