# Chapter 327 - Liu Si Takes the Bait

"You beast—you're worse than an animal!" Zhao Dachong roared deliberately.

Seven or eight people, men and women, were already standing in the room. In the chaos, Xin Nachun threw herself into Zhao Dachong's arms, crying desperately—but without tears.

"I don't want to live!" she screamed, then resumed her wailing.

Liu Si struggled to climb up, stood stunned for a moment, then turned to run. But the door was blocked; he couldn't escape.

"Where do you think you're going?" Zhao Dachong grabbed him and delivered several slaps. While beating him, he cursed: "You dare defile my intended wife! A yellow flower girl, a virgin! You raped her! You look human, but you have a beast's heart!"

While the commotion escalated, people in the room stepped aside. Zhao Haiji arrived.

Zhao Dachong said deliberately: "Eighth Uncle, this is the good guest you invited! He dared rape your nephew's wife!"

Xin Nachun howled through sobs: "Eighth Uncle, you've harmed Little Chun miserably. Little Chun has no face to live, *wuwuwu*..."

Zhao Haiji feigned shock: "Oh!" He acted greatly surprised.

After the commotion settled, Zhao Haiji said slowly to Liu Si: "I treated you as a decent person, invited you to a banquet, asked you to put in a good word for us and plead for mercy. It's fine if you were unwilling—but how could you be such a beast in human clothing, raping a civilian woman? In any dynasty, that's a capital crime! Do you know that?" His eyes glared sideways. "Someone come!"

"Here." A half-grown boy walked out.

"Tie him up. We'll send him to the Ancestral Hall and hand him to the Work Team. I want to see how their 'Protecting the Territory and Comforting the People' actually comforts people!" Zhao Haiji strode into the inner room; Zhao Dachong followed.

Liu Si was tied by seven or eight hands and pushed into the inner room. Someone kicked his knees, forcing him to kneel.

"Tell me—what should be done about raping a civilian woman?" Zhao Haiji asked deliberately. Zhao Dachong raised a cudgel, waving it before Liu Si's eyes: "What to do? By reason, attempted rape means being beaten to death without liability. For the sake of him being in the Work Team, hang him up and beat him, then send him to the Team and let them handle it! If they don't, send him to the county yamen!"

Liu Si was sweating with fright and quickly begged for mercy, claiming he'd drunk too much and let lust overflow. After prolonged pleading, he managed to avoid physical pain.

Seeing the timing was right, Zhao Haiji said: "Nephew, go out first. Eighth Uncle will definitely give you an explanation."

Zhao Dachong humped pretentiously and left.

After everyone departed, Zhao Haiji called an advisor: "Get paper and pen. Write down everything he says."

The advisor's supplies were ready; he wrote on the kang table immediately.

"After writing, read it to him."

The advisor read: "The lowly one, Liu Si, broke into civilian Zhao Dachong's home after the banquet, encountered civilian woman Xin Nachun, and carried out coercive rape. The woman was unwilling, clothes torn and stripped forcibly. The intent to rape is true."

Liu Si defended himself: "The lowly one didn't mean to..."

"Didn't mean to tear a girl's clothes?" Zhao Haiji said. Liu Si was speechless—this wasn't a Hongmen Banquet but a trap to catch a dog.

Zhao Haiji asked: "Do you want to settle this privately or publicly?"

"Privately! Privately." Liu Si naturally understood.

Settled publicly, being pushed to the Ancestral Hall would not only humiliate him but disgrace Chiefs Du and Dong. He would be finished with the Transmigration Group forever.

"At least you know what's good for you! Someone untie him!" Zhao Haiji smiled triumphantly. This Miss Xin was indeed quite useful. "To settle privately, press a handprint on this confession."

Helpless, Liu Si pressed his print. Zhao Haiji folded the paper into his sleeve and immediately changed face: "Fourth Master Liu, you've been startled." He cupped his hands.

Liu Si remained silent. With his wisdom, he clearly understood their scheme.

Zhao Haiji drank tea slowly: "We are now people on the same boat." He paused, studied Liu Si's face, and shouted: "Someone come!"

A small official box with vermilion lacquer and copper corners was brought in—about the size of a woman's dressing box, heavy, with a small lock.

Zhao Haiji produced a key and opened it: "Fourth Master Liu, a little token of appreciation. Please accept with a smile—consider it an apology." He opened the box, making the dim room shine brilliantly.

Inside were all kinds of jewelry—gold and silver: hairpins, anklets, bridal headpieces, children's lockets, various styles, some inlaid with pearls, jadeite, and gemstones. Floating light and overflowing color stunned Liu Si.

He'd never seen such riches. His hands trembled. He declined: "I dare not take this—it's too precious..."

"Don't refuse face when offered." Zhao Haiji's expression turned cold.

Helpless, Liu Si accepted.

"Keep them with Widow Zhou. Don't worry—we'll take good care of her. She's climbed up a high branch."

Seeing Liu Si distracted, he added: "Don't be afraid. Since Fourth Master Liu talks loyalty with us, we aren't people without affection and justice."

"Yes, yes." Liu Si finally caught his breath.

Zhao Haiji leaned close and whispered: "Help us do some things. I hear the Work Team has been whispering lately. What are they saying? Tell us everything. Naturally, there will be benefits—words count!"

Liu Si had no choice: "Since you gentlemen take such care of me, I'll be at your disposal!"

"Good. Go back first. If there's anything, we'll message you at Widow Zhou's."

---

After a few days, the plan seemed to proceed smoothly. Though Old Man Mei continued looking listless, he could still speak under forced questioning. From him, Zhao Dachong learned the two female officials were very dissatisfied with the current situation and often quarreled. The Red-haired Monk was nothing special—just "preaching reason" all day and teaching songs.

Zhao Haiji secretly met Liu Si at Widow Zhou's house and obtained even more crucial news.

"The Australians' bandit suppression is expanding," Liu Si reported after eating his fill. "Men and horses are being moved toward Danzhou."

Zhao Haiji became interested: "So this area will soon be quiet?"

"Correct." Liu Si glanced outside and lowered his voice: "The higher-ups are dissatisfied with these two women's work and want to transfer a man here."

"Mm, mm." Zhao Haiji listened carefully. "What's this man's background?"

"I'm not clear on that. Chief Du surnamed Du has been losing her temper every evening, quarreling with Chief Dong. They're at odds—seems it's because of this."

This matched Old Man Mei's news. Zhao Haiji believed firmly.

"...These days, guards are packing luggage. The new captain will probably arrive soon. Several people must be dispatched from here to escort the two women back. Truly troublesome."

Zhao Haiji's eyelid twitched. *Right—transferring the women back, they'll surely draw people to escort them. A good opportunity: the ancestral hall's military strength will be empty.*

"How many are going?"

"About six or seven." Liu Si saw his eyes lighting up. "What? You're—"

"Nothing, nothing!" *This must be discussed with Zhao Dachong quickly—a great opportunity cannot be missed.*

That night, Zhao Dachong and Zhao Haiji discussed and decided Zhao Dachong would find Zhao Haixie and Xin Nari, discuss the matter, and bring the troops back.

"Indeed a good opportunity! But to succeed, we still need Liu Si's help." Xin Nari nodded after hearing the overnight news.

"How so?"

"The ammunition matter!" Xin Nari said, "Even with five or six gone, a dozen remain. If they start shooting, we still can't handle it." Zhao Haixie had been tormented by the Transmigration Army and directly understood firearms' power.

"Let Liu Si coordinate from inside. Just don't know if this kid has the guts!"

"With a handle held over him, should he refuse?" Zhao Haixie said.

"Useless." Xin Nari shook his head. "Liu Si only fears a confession. Passing messages is fine. Doing something that costs his head—he won't. He'll sell us out the moment he turns around!"

"Then what?"

"Under heavy rewards, there must be brave men!" Xin Nari waved his hand. "How much money and valuables remain in the village?"

"Still have to give money?" Zhao Dachong nearly shouted. "We already gave him a box of jewelry!"

He had his own reasons for refusing. Zhao Haiqing had been Dang Namen's "General Manager"—the gang's money and grain had passed through his hands. After the stronghold fell, large savings were gone, but many valuables remained hidden in Daolu Village. Though not under Zhao Dachong's control, he'd long known the hiding place and exact amounts. He regarded this wealth as his own capital and had been hoarding the secret—though arrogant, Zhao Dachong wasn't stupid. Xin Nari now had men and Greenwood connections; if Zhao Dachong himself wanted to become boss, or at minimum a major leader, he could only rely on holding this wealth.

How could Xin Nari not know his wishful thinking? But right now, the gang was poor and blank—only Zhao Dachong still controlled wealth. He had to work hard to persuade him.
