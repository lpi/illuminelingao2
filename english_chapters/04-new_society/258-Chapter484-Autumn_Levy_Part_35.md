# Chapter 484 - Autumn Levy (Part 35)

Liu Youren was startled. So the "land survey" that Chen Minggang's gang had conducted was completely fictitious—just as he had expected. Old Eight had been using it as a pretext for his own schemes.

"At last!" he sighed. "The land survey business is over."

"Third Uncle! The land survey business isn't over yet!"

"What do you mean?"

"Third Uncle, look at this. This is the Australians' 'Administrative Appeal Response.' Every grain household who signed the petition received one."

Liu Youren hurriedly opened another neatly-folded piece of paper. It was also a printed document. The heading was quite blunt—"To Liu Youren of Liu Family Stronghold, Lingao County."

Not even a basic salutation. Named directly. But Liu Youren didn't care about such niceties. He quickly read through the response and immediately understood its meaning. He slumped back in his seat.

According to the response, the Australians were definitely going to proceed with land surveying. All this commotion—the Australians had rejected Chen Minggang's "survey," only to do it themselves!

"Third Uncle, now what? With Chen Minggang's gang finished, even if we wanted to negotiate, there's no one to talk to! Should we invite Zhou Qi over for a chat? He just got promoted to Household Clerk. He's now a top favorite under the Australians..."

"You're quite mistaken about that." Liu Youren shook his head. "Zhou Qi isn't any kind of favorite—he's just a front man. If they really valued him, there wouldn't be a Grain Collection Bureau."

The Grain Collection Bureau's Director-General was County Deputy Wu Ya, and the Managing Director was an Australian. Apart from carrying the title of "Household Clerk," Zhou Qi was completely excluded from grain collection matters. Not a trace of favored status.

"And if you go looking for him now, he probably won't even dare meet with you."

"What can we do?" Liu Guangbiao was quite anxious—and this wasn't an act. Liu Family Stronghold's finances passed through his hands. How much taxable land was assessed directly affected his own economic benefits.

Liu Youren fell silent. He too was one of those who had signed the petition. Should he go to Huang Binkun again and consult with him about continuing to appeal to Liu Dalin?

"It won't work." He immediately rejected his own idea. As things stood, the Australians had given Lingao's gentry and major households ample face. Chen Minggang's gang had just been dealt with. If he submitted another petition now, the other side wouldn't be so polite—especially with the recent renewed rumors about the Australians' various "sorceries" circulating again. A chill ran down his spine.

Huang Binkun was right there in the county seat and should have heard the news earlier than himself, yet there had been no word from him. Apparently this Huang Second Young Master had lost his nerve and didn't dare take the lead again.

What about following the same approach they'd used against Chen Minggang—reporting some while hiding some? Last time they'd already reported an additional two hundred thirty *mu*. Going below that figure was absolutely impossible. But how much to report exactly...

Suddenly, he realized something with a start: many of Chen Minggang's people were now in Australian hands. These people knew the true land situation of local major households very well—take Zhou Qi, for instance. He knew the actual amount of Liu Family Stronghold's land holdings perfectly clearly. Zhou Qi had gotten his Household Clerk position by relying on the Australians. Nine times out of ten, he would use these secrets to curry favor with them.

Fortunately he'd thought of this—otherwise he might well become the "chicken" in "kill the chicken to warn the monkeys."

"Third Uncle, should we invite Chief Xun over for a chat?"

Liu Youren recalled that the Divine Society's agricultural technician was currently at their estate. Perhaps he could sound out the Australians' intentions—though he didn't hold out much hope. The last time he'd tried to get information about the "land survey" from Xun Suji, using all manner of methods to draw him out, he'd gotten nothing. These people kept their lips sealed tight.

"What is Chief Xun doing?"

"Teaching the farmhands to use the threshing machine." Liu Guangbiao smacked his lips. "That thing is really useful..."

---

Xun Suji's days were quite fulfilling—which is to say, he was extremely busy every day. On one hand, he served as Deputy General Manager of Lingao Grain & Oil Food Products Corporation, concurrently serving as factory director and chief engineer of the food processing plant. He also had to teach weekly classes at the National School's "Chef Rapid Training Program." Finally, three times a month he had Divine Society service assignments—as a technical advisor.

At least the Divine Society was considerate enough to assign him only one major landlord, Liu Youren. Unlike other agri-technicians who had to make the rounds, he didn't have to travel constantly.

Liu Youren's holdings were the largest among Divine Society clients—rivaling the County Academy's school-endowment lands—and qualified as a priority client with dedicated agri-technician service.

For Xun Suji, serving as Divine Society advisor was practically a vacation on his schedule. Liu Youren was a major landlord, and Liu Family Stronghold's living conditions were excellent. Each visit there was quite comfortable—true landlord treatment, not like the rural minor-landlord treatment at Wan Lihui's. He was given a private courtyard and assigned two servants to handle chores.

Now the most stressful and busy phases of planting and management had passed. The farmhands were gradually mastering the new agricultural methods. Throughout the growing process, Xun Suji had used new techniques and management approaches to solve longstanding problems, building the farmers' confidence in the Divine Society's "Australian agricultural methods." The arriving harvest had them completely convinced.

Liu Youren's trust in him had also increased substantially. Previously, he'd always thought the Divine Society's implements were too expensive. Now he unhesitatingly purchased and used anything the Divine Society promoted, quite decisively. Sometimes he even proactively asked whether the Divine Society had any new agricultural supplies coming out.

Before this harvest, the Divine Society had organized the Agricultural Implements Factory to produce a batch of pedal-powered threshing machines. Simple threshing machines had existed in ancient times, but in Lingao, people still used the most primitive method of beating rice stalks against wooden bins to thresh grain—inefficient and wasteful. The Divine Society's threshing machine was built according to blueprints from a 1990s-era human-powered model: a rectangular box shape with a foot pedal below the threshing end, connected by a belt to an iron wheel on the side. The wheel shared an axle with an internal drum. The drum was fitted with U-shaped curved tines, their sharp ends driven into the drum. The drum ends had iron wheels; between them ran parallel wooden beams. The rotating tines threshed the grain, and could also shell peanuts. Much faster than beating stalks against a wooden bin, with far less waste.

This machine was not only convenient but also lightweight. Two adult men could carry it between them. So when it was first demonstrated, the first batch of ten units was snapped up immediately by members.

Another piece of equipment was a wind-powered grain winnowing machine, using small windmills to blow and separate grain husks—replacing the manual winnowing traditionally done in villages. Not only faster but also saving labor. Lingao's wind resources were fairly abundant, and small windmills presented no difficulty for a transmigrator industry that had mastered gear manufacturing.

Both agricultural implements caused quite a stir among Divine Society users and also amazed other farmers. Add to this year's autumn harvest: every Divine Society client had enjoyed bumper crops of varying scale, with yields increasing anywhere from thirty to fifty percent. The sensation was considerable.

"Watch your rhythm. Don't pedal too fast." Xun Suji, wearing a straw hat, instructed the farmhand who was threshing. The man nodded, seemingly understanding. Xun Suji went to check another machine—it had broken down. The belt was jammed.

Using tools from his tool belt, he struggled to repair it. The substandard parts produced by the Mechanical Industry Department had terrible tolerances and frequently malfunctioned. While laboriously correcting the deformed component and repositioning the belt on the guide wheel, he didn't forget to teach the young farmhand beside him about the machine's principles and how to troubleshoot simple problems.

Finally, the belt was back in place. Xun Suji rose from the ground, sweat dripping in sheets from his head. He removed his straw hat and, mimicking the heroic laborers in old movies, fanned himself with a grand gesture.

"Looking like this, I should at least get a Model Worker award or something."

"Chief Xun, would you like some tea?" The speaker was none other than Liu Meilan. Ever since Liu Guangbiao had decided to marry her off to Xun Suji, he'd been visiting her family constantly, wearing down her father with persistence. Liu Meilan's father had finally relented and agreed.

As for the girl's own opinion—no one in this era gave it a thought. So Liu Meilan was now preparing to be married off to Xun Suji. To create opportunities, whenever Xun Suji came to Liu Family Stronghold, Liu Meilan was frequently sent to serve tea and bring refreshments; sometimes she even delivered fruits and snacks to his residence.

The Liu uncles and nephew calculated that if Xun Suji took a liking to her and spoke up, they would immediately agree. Unexpectedly, Xun Suji behaved like a perfect gentleman. Whenever Liu Meilan came to deliver something, he was very polite, sometimes barely exchanging a few words before the conversation lapsed into awkward silence.

Xun Suji had no idea such a good thing was waiting for him. He hadn't interpreted Liu Meilan's frequent appearances before him as any sort of matchmaking signal—partly because he was dense about romantic matters as otaku tended to be, and partly because he simply didn't understand seventeenth-century courtship customs.

"Thank you, Miss Liu." Xun Suji accepted the tea bowl and drained it in one gulp. The tea was bitter and astringent, but drinking it down was cooling and thirst-quenching—quite refreshing.

Liu Meilan couldn't help but giggle at his manner of gulping it down like a cow. This man was nothing like the Australian "chiefs" she had imagined. He was unremarkable in appearance. Though his skin was a bit fairer, his every gesture lacked any resemblance to the elegant young gentlemen of romance novels. He looked quite uncouth—and he actually did farm work himself! She had always thought that truly distinguished young masters wouldn't do farm work themselves. Only landlords like her family, small-time landowners, would go out to the fields alongside their farmhands and tenants.

Being told by her elders to marry this Australian, Liu Meilan was somewhat reluctant. The young man she fancied was the son of a small landlord in the neighboring village—very refined-looking, having just recently "entered school." Liu Meilan had seen him several times at village temple fairs and still harbored fantasies about him.
