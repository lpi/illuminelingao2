# Chapter 272: Leizhou Sugar Company

Chang Shide reclined halfway on the bed. He had drunk some hangover soup, and though his head was still fuzzy, he felt quite content. Just as he was about to drift off, Wen Xiu slipped silently into the room. The boy wore only a close-fitting undershirt, his hair untied and combed back. His face was flushed like peach blossoms, his almond eyes brimming with seduction. Chang Shide was momentarily stunned, unsure of the purpose behind this display.

Wen Xiu curtsied like a woman and whispered, "Wen Xiu is here to attend Your Honor to bed."

He stepped forward to help undress Chang, his soft, delicate hands kneading Chang’s body. In a coy voice, he called out: "Your Honor—"

Chang Shide remained frozen for about five seconds. Then, suddenly, every drop of alcohol seemed to evaporate through his pores. A chill rushed from his heels straight to the crown of his head, and goosebumps rose all over his body.

"No—!"

He let out a wail, shoved Wen Xiu away, and scrambled off the bed. *What the hell?* What kind of era was this where a servant sexually harassed the master? If it had been a maidservant, that would be one thing—but this was a man. No matter how pretty Wen Xiu was, he was still male.

The small commotion triggered a chaotic scene. Zhou Shizhai burst through the door instantly. Seeing the tableau, the escort's expression changed dramatically. He quickly mumbled, "Please take your time, Your Honor," and backed out with his head bowed.

"No, Old Zhou, let me explain—" Chang Shide hadn't even put on his shoes before scrambling after him. Outside, Li Biao was craning his neck to peek, and several escort guards had gathered in the courtyard, clutching swords and staves.

"What are you looking at? Get back, all of you!" Zhou Shizhai waved his hand impatiently, then turned to the disheveled Chang Shide. "Chief Chang, your appearance is rather... unsightly."

"Right, right, I know." He hurried back inside to put on his shoes.

By now, Wen Tong had also emerged. He had been drafting a report on improving sugar production by lamplight. Hearing the noise, he came out to investigate, only to see Wen Xiu, clothes in disarray, exiting Chang Shide's room with an aggrieved look. Wen Tong immediately jumped to the wrong conclusion, and his face darkened.

"Old Chang, I always knew you were a bit of a flirt, but I didn't expect you played for *that* team!" Wen Tong didn't discriminate against gay men, but he held contempt for those who swung both ways purely for physical pleasure.

"Nothing of the sort!" Chang Shide was so frantic he was practically clawing at his cheeks, wishing the ground would swallow him. It was clearly this deviant who had tried to harass *him*, yet everyone seemed to think he was plotting against the fellow's backside.

"Old Wen, you have to believe your revolutionary comrade! How can you not trust me? We were dorm-mates in Lingao! You know what kind of person I am!"

"Hard to say. Once people leave the collective, many ugly aspects of human nature are revealed."

"I've been wronged!" Chang Shide pointed to heaven and earth, swearing oaths and explaining frantically until Wen Tong was finally inclined to believe that Wen Xiu had been the aggressor. By then, Liao Dahua had arrived. Still fuming about being wrongly accused, Chang Shide couldn't help but take it out on Liao Dahua as well. He even cursed Guo Yi—how could he send a catamite to serve them?

Liao Dahua laughed. "Master Chang need not be angry. The boys simply misunderstood. These servant boys are raised specifically to attend to gentlemen—serving tea and attending to daily needs by day, and acting as bed companions by night. It is quite normal. Yesterday, Shopkeeper Wen said not to buy maidservants and that traveling with servant boys was more convenient. They must have gotten the wrong idea. Since the Master has no interest in such things, I will give them a good scolding."

"What? That's a thing?" Chang Shide was shocked, his preconceptions about ancient sexual mores shattered.

"Very common. Those scholars wandering the land with their books, swords, and lutes—they all bring a young servant boy along. First, it's convenient to have someone to order around away from home; second, when they can't bear the loneliness at night, they use them to relieve tension. The high officials at court also keep them; the particularly intimate ones are doted on even more than concubines."

"*Damn*, what kind of society is this!" Chang Shide couldn't help but curse.

Liao Dahua stood by, smiling apologetically. He realized that the child Wen Xiu had been too eager to curry favor and had attempted to "offer himself at the pillow," but his flattery had backfired. Neither of these two seemed to have a taste for the "Southern Wind." He began mentally scheming to quickly find a few maidservants instead.

The evening's disturbance passed. At first, Chang Shide remained suspicious, terrified his heroic image would become a laughingstock. Later, he discovered that the locals had no interest in gossiping about the matter at all. Even Wen Xiu came the next day to bring his washing water as if nothing had happened. Presumably, as Liao Dahua had said, this sort of thing really wasn't considered a big deal.

The next day, the pair continued traveling by sedan chair, protected by the Qiwei Escort Agency personnel. Over the course of half a month, they inspected all the sugarcane estates and sugar mills under their control, gaining a preliminary understanding of the situation. The hardships of the journey—the dust and toil—need not be detailed. They encountered several highway robbery attempts along the way, but thanks to the Qiwei escorts, they passed through without serious danger.

The conditions at the various estates and sugar mills were largely similar. Some still had a few long-term workers remaining; others were completely deserted. Wen Tong now understood Leizhou's sugar production landscape: it was a typical integration of estate and mill. There were no independent rustic sugar mills operating purely as processors. They were all attached to cane estates run by landlords or farmers with larger holdings, or were cooperatively operated by cane farmers pooling resources. The rustic mills primarily processed sugarcane from their own fields, with outside toll processing as a secondary function. Equipment utilization rates were low, so without exception, the operations were small-scale and primitively equipped.

Sugarcane cultivation didn't follow the tenant farming system common in rural areas. Small plots of land were self-cultivated by cane farmers, with a few day laborers hired during the busy season. Larger plots were entirely managed by landlords hiring long-term workers—already showing the embryonic form of agricultural wage labor.

Therefore, once the land changed hands, the labor force vanished. This was completely different from the tenant farming system, where landlords changed but tenants remained. This created an urgent demand for replenishing the workforce.

On this day, the party returned to the estate in Xuwen. Zhang Xin had also arrived in Xuwen as the liaison from the Guangzhou Station. As the future primary distributor of Leizhou white sugar, the Guangzhou Station attached great importance to this enterprise.

At the proposal of the Guangzhou Station and with the Executive Committee's approval, Wen Tong and Chang Shide formally established the Leizhou Sugar Company in Xuwen. The capital for the company was allocated by the Guangzhou Station. The sugarcane estate outside Xuwen town would serve as the headquarters. Wen Tong planned to use Xuwen as a pilot site for sugar industry improvements.

"Can it produce white sugar?" Zhang Xin was very concerned about this question and asked repeatedly.

"No problem. We can produce white sugar better than any in Guangdong." Wen Tong was extremely confident. "But to have a price advantage, we'll need to see if the Machinery Department can help us build equipment."

"Some Englishmen have recently arrived in Guangzhou," Zhang Xin noted. "They're being very cautious, currently seeking to purchase goods. Sugar is a major item of interest. If we can produce sugar before April, selling twenty or thirty tons shouldn't be a problem."

"That's doable. But I'll need the Guangzhou Station to give me enough manpower," Wen Tong said. "Replenishing labor locally is difficult."

"How many people?"

"At least three hundred." In Wen Tong's plan, this batch would become the first workers for the sugarcane farms and sugar factory. Each estate needed at least twenty laborers added; those with sugar mills would need even more.

"All able-bodied laborers?"

"Women and children too. That way, the able-bodied men are tied down. Besides, farm women from Guangdong and Fujian are very capable. They're strong and, as I see it, no worse than men. Oh, and find about ten people with cattle-raising experience."

"Fine. I can give you five hundred." Zhang Xin agreed immediately. Due to the ongoing migration work, Lingao's reception capacity was strained. A single purification cycle took forty days, and Lingao's quarantine camp could only accommodate about four hundred people at a time. Many recruited migrants had to be settled in Guangzhou to await transport. The Guangzhou Station had established a village in the outskirts resembling a quarantine zone for this purpose, conducting preliminary "purification" work. The camp now held over a thousand people. To avoid arousing the local government's suspicions, Guo Yi was already trying to ship some of them out as quickly as possible.

"I'm afraid I can't handle five hundred," Wen Tong said. "Let's start with three hundred. There's too much going on here. I was also hoping to get some cadres from Lingao."

"Cadres are hard to come by," Zhang Xin said. "The Qiwei people are very reliable. You can select some backbone members from among them to serve as military cadres." Seeing Wen Tong's surprised expression, Zhang Xin added, "Leizhou is a chaotic place. As a major sugar mill owner, you'll naturally attract the envy of various 'heroes' eventually. Bandits go without saying, but if the local gentry get ideas, that could also be trouble. To protect your person and property, you'll need armed forces. Start by setting up a militia. Weapons will be shipped from Lingao."

"Alright." Wen Tong figured he'd hand this task over to Chang Shide—after all, the man knew how to wield a ghost-head blade.

"I plan to first establish a sugarcane cooperative here in Xuwen, then expand to Haikang, Suixi, and other places."

"Keep buying up sugarcane land to expand the plantations?"

"I would like to run plantations," Wen Tong said. "Right now, the operating model here is still mainly small-scale farming. The planting and management standards are too backward."

During the half-month journey, Wen Tong had obtained a fairly clear picture of sugarcane cultivation in the region. Under the small-scale farming economy, cultivation of cash crops was highly arbitrary: some grew fruit cane, some grew sugar cane. As for field management, some clearly put in great effort, while others were slapdash, entirely dependent on the weather. Some people were even growing sugarcane in places that weren't suitable for it at all.

For a cash crop like sugarcane, the best operating model was naturally large-scale plantations: consolidating these small patches of land into one large estate. Whether using a wage-labor system or slavery, production efficiency would be far higher than the current smallholder farming.

But purchasing the cane farmers' land wasn't easy. Cane farmers rarely went bankrupt. Even paying those terrifyingly high interest rates, cultivating cane fields remained profitable. Without natural or man-made disasters, mass land annexation was nearly impossible. Unless the transmigrators manipulated sugar prices to force all these smallholders into bankruptcy and then bought them out one by one. Wen Tong didn't agree with this approach—not because he was particularly compassionate, but because he didn't think the Transmigration Enterprise had that capability yet.

"My idea is to set up a sugarcane cooperative." Wen Tong produced his proposal: organize all growers producing the same crop. Under the company's supervision, they would provide unified technical guidance and improved varieties, unified fertilizer purchasing, unified sugar processing, and unified sales. Lower costs, increase returns. Wen Tong estimated this proposal would attract quite a few small growers.

"This plan won't show much result in the first year, but over time, once the benefits become apparent, farmers will naturally be willing to join. There's no other way—we're not the government and can't mandate it. We can only rely on word-of-mouth reputation."

"Then you'll need to put down roots in Leizhou." Zhang Xin looked at the grand plan. "This won't show results for three to five years. Just persuading each household, plus the dividend distribution after harvest... you'll need quite a team to help you."

"Putting down roots is fine. I can enjoy the life of a grand landlord." Wen Tong was very interested in this enterprise. "As for management and technical personnel, I've applied to the Education Committee for some. I'll take whatever they can allocate. If it's not enough, I plan to conduct my own training. As for persuading small farmers to join—I'll convince as many as I can. After three to five years, if all goes well, I'll be the largest sugar supplier in Leizhou. With abundant, high-quality sugar, I can then engage in predatory pricing, driving the market purchase prices into the ground and bankrupting everyone who refuses to join the cooperative. Then I'll just buy up both them and their land."

Zhang Xin nodded repeatedly. He hadn't expected Wen Tong, a technical man, to be capable of such ruthless tactics.

"Whatever you need, just ask. The Guangzhou Station will fully cooperate."

"We're just a sugar production base here. We don't have an intelligence staff allocation. But I'd very much like to know the specifics of Hai'an Street. The locals call it 'Sweet Port.' Sugar is all exported from there, and there are quite a few sugar hongs on that street. These merchants from the Chaoshan region—sooner or later, they'll be our competitors—"

"That's easy. We'll arrange for someone to go undercover there. If normal methods don't work when the time comes, we'll use abnormal ones. The Special Reconnaissance Team is itching for action."

"Haha, preferably not. But our time is limited. We can't afford to drag things out in some commercial war. Cutting the Gordian knot is better."

The two sides agreed on a series of communication methods. Since Leizhou wasn't an official dispatch station, just a secondary outpost, there was currently no radio allocation. Communication with Lingao would primarily use carrier pigeons. Communication with Guangzhou could also utilize the Qiwei Escort Agency's routes for transmitting letters. Per the Executive Committee's instructions, unless absolutely necessary, they should avoid sending people directly across the sea to Lingao—the less direct contact between the two sides, the better.

The Executive Committee also had a line on the salt merchant Liu Gang in Leizhou, who resided within Haikang County's borders. After consideration, however, the Executive Committee decided the two sides should maintain separate single-line contacts and avoid interaction. Liu Gang was an important channel for smuggling salt to the mainland and needed to be carefully protected.
