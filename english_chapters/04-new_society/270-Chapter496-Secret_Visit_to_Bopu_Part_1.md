# Chapter 496 - Secret Visit to Bopu (Part 1)

Ignoring them seemed to have worked. After a period of time, the pleas for help from Lingao, which used to come every seven or eight days, disappeared. Tang Yunwen was deeply afraid that the Lingao county seat had fallen—if that were the case, matters would be troublesome if some rival impeached him for "failing to save the dying." He sent people to the prefectural yamen to inquire, and they reported back that the courier road to Lingao was open and the county seat was still standing fine. This made him sigh in relief. Since there was peace and no incident, there was no need to rack his brains.

Tang Yunwen simply put the matter of the big iron ship out of his mind. Compared to this big iron ship in Lingao, he had more troublesome things to deal with: first, Liu Xiang, a rising star on the Guangdong seas, was harassing and robbing around the Pearl River Estuary, attempting to monopolize Guangdong's overseas trade, and occasionally coming to the waters of Qiongzhou, Leizhou, and Lianzhou to make a grab, robbing salt and sugar ships. The old pirate Zhu Cailao showed no weakness, fighting him happily on the Guangdong seas. The chaos in the Fujian seas also disturbed the Guangdong coast. For a time, people came and went, smoke rose everywhere, and calls for Tang Yunwen to mobilize his troops for "joint suppression" came one after another. Tang Yunwen led his own troops to fight everywhere, moving between the Fujian and Guangdong seas, his seat never warm, busy and battered.

With Zhu Cailao's defeat and death at Nanri Island, Tang Yunwen finally had a chance to breathe and withdrew his troops to the base camp for rest. But soon after returning to the White Sand Water Fortress, he received unsettling news. Patrol boats captured scattered pirate stragglers who confessed that a remnant of Zhu Cailao's subordinates had gone to Lingao. There were seventy or eighty ships and over a thousand people.

These pirate remnants who had gone to Lingao were now sending people to recruit surrenderers and renegades on the Guangdong seas, constantly luring Zhu Cailao's former remnants to Lingao to "defect to the Australians." This was the first time Tang Yunwen had heard the name "Australians." He hurriedly sent spies to Lingao again to inquire about the news.

The news brought back shocked him greatly. It turned out that the Australians who came to Lingao in the big iron ship not only hadn't left but were also building houses and constructing docks at Bopu, seemingly intending to stay in Lingao for a long time. This reminded him of the past when the Franks attempted to build a city and stay in Tunmen—later they gained a foothold in Macao. Could it be that these Australians also intended to use the old trick of the Franks?

This was a major matter that couldn't be ignored. Tang Yunwen became tense. He knew very well the imperial court's attitude toward these overseas people—except for Macao, they were absolutely not allowed to stay on Great Ming's land, let alone build cities and docks. Whether it was Shuangyu and Tunmen back in the day, or Penghu in the Tianqi era, the court's attitude was consistent: for Westerners wanting to stay and build cities on Great Ming soil, there was only one word: "Fight."

Thinking of this, he dared not play deaf and mute anymore. Counting from the arrival of the iron ship in Lingao, this group of overseas "Australians" had been in Lingao for almost a year. In this year, they had probably gained a firm foothold in Lingao, which was why they were aggressively recruiting Zhu Cailao's remnants to expand their strength.

In this view, the situation in Lingao was worrying! Tang Yunwen hurriedly sent people everywhere to inquire about news from Lingao. The result surprised him. In this past year, Lingao not only hadn't sent a single cry for help against pirate invasions, but had repeatedly presented severed pirate heads and captured seals, flags, and documents to the prefecture. Among them were notorious pirate leaders wanted by the government. Even several heads of Western pirates had been presented.

"Magistrate Wu Mingjin of Lingao is a top-tier popular official now," Jiang Youling told him. With pirate activities almost extinct in Lingao waters, the Prefect regarded him highly.

"What about the so-called Australians?"

"That's where things are strange," Jiang Youling said. "Magistrate Wu never mentioned the matter of Australians in his letters to the prefectural yamen."

"You mean..." Tang Yunwen whispered, "Magistrate Wu is colluding with the Australians?"

"Whether there is collusion is hard to say, but at least there is a tacit understanding of non-aggression."

"Wu Mingjin is too bold," Tang Yunwen said. "However, it seems Lingao is quite peaceful."

"More than just peaceful," Jiang Youling said. Now Lingao had become a major destination in Qiongzhou Prefecture. Merchants traveling to Lingao for business were endless, and every day many merchants from the mainland transferred ships at Shenying Port to go to Lingao.

"Now there's an external counter of the Gaoguang Shipping Company in Shenying Port. Anyone wanting to go to Lingao can simply buy a ticket at the counter and take a ship there. It's very convenient."

Local prosperity and boom rarely seen on the island had appeared in Lingao, which was obviously related to the Australians. Wu Mingjin hadn't achieved this situation after being Lingao magistrate for several years; the big iron ship came for a year and things advanced by leaps and bounds. No one would believe the Australians weren't involved.

Tang Yunwen decided to go to Bopu personally to see the situation. News obtained through hearsay always had unreliable parts. He would make a decision then.

This led to the scene of him dressing as a fisherman and personally sailing out to probe the truth.

"Raise sail, go to Changgong Bay," Tang Yunwen ordered his men.

Changgong Bay was just west of Lingao Cape, a traditional fishing ground for Lingao with many fishing boats operating. With sails dotting the sea surface, it should be easy to blend in.

Unexpectedly, the boat boss acting as guide shook his head: "Vice Commander! It's not that I refuse to go. To fish in Lingao waters, you need something called a 'license' and receive a small flag to hang on the mast. I haven't processed one. If the boat goes over and casts a net, the Australian fast boats will come to inspect. At best they confiscate the catch; at worst they confiscate the boat too."

"What is this license about?"

"I heard that you're only allowed to fish in Lingao waters if you get a flag, and you have to pay one-fifth of the catch as tax daily."

Tang Yunwen nodded. The Australians indeed knew how to make money. The marine catch in the Lingao area was very rich. Controlling this territory and extorting fishermen would yield considerable income. He himself received three or four thousand taels of silver annually in filial piety from fishing masters all over the island.

"Since that's the case, no need to cast nets for fish. just bring the boat closer."

The boat boss was helpless. He didn't know Tang Yunwen's specific identity, but there was no doubt they were officers from the government army at White Sand Water Fortress. People who made a living on the water naturally couldn't afford to provoke such characters. Coupled with the greed for the promised "extra silver," he risked taking the boat toward Lingao Cape.

Propelled by the great yuloh, the boat quietly approached Lingao Cape. It was fishing season, and there were many fishing boats on the water. This two-masted fishing boat quietly blended into the fleet, completely inconspicuous.

The boat boss was very worried, looking around constantly and urging him to "be quick." Tang Yunwen secretly laughed at the boat boss's timidity—with so many boats, how could the so-called Australians watch over them all? He proceeded to use his telescope to observe Lingao Cape.

Tang Yunwen had passed Lingao Cape at least dozens of times while leading patrol boats. It used to be a natural rock embankment with nothing on it.

Now Lingao Cape had completely changed. On the tip extending into the sea, a circular battery had been built with multiple protruding bastions on the outside. The battery wasn't tall but was built extremely solidly and thickly, constructed entirely of large stones. On the platform, he could vaguely see a huge iron cannon. It looked much larger than the Red Barbarian cannons bought by the Imperial Court.

Many jetties had been built at Lingao Cape, all paved with large stones, wide and flat like broad roads. Large and small ships were moored there. People and carts came and went on the embankment, very lively. Many identica tall wooden frames with big wooden wheels had been built on the embankment, extending long crane arms to hoist cargo back and forth—seeming to be something like a well sweep.

Tang Yunwen was secretly alarmed. Leaving aside the power of the cannon, just building such a solid platform and these stone jetties at Lingao Cape... if the government were to do it, even with sufficient funds and no worries, he estimated it would take at least two or three years.

"My Lord, the beacon tower!" His personal general Zhang Wen reminded him in a low voice.

The beacon tower had also changed appearance. Originally, the bricks and stones on the surface of this beacon tower had mostly fallen off, and some parts had collapsed into soil, overgrown with wild grass and small trees, looking like a small earthen hill. Now, the beacon tower had been re-bricked all over, trees and weeds cleared away cleanly, a small house built on top, and vaguely a very large iron cannon could be seen on it.

Tang Yunwen felt strange: The beacon tower certainly offered a wide field of view and could see extremely far, but mounting an iron cannon on it seemed meaningless—the Red Barbarian cannons bought by the Imperial Court had a maximum range of only four or five hundred *zhang*, and had absolutely no accuracy. This beacon tower was five or six *li* away from the sea surface at Bopu. If the cannon fired, wouldn't the cannonball hit the land?

Could it be the cannonball could hit the sea? That would mean this cannon could shoot at least five or six *li*! Tang Yunwen was a general with actual combat experience and had dealt with Europeans, unlike literati who scribbled nonsense about firearms tactics. He knew the so-called Western cannons "reaching ten *li*" was pure nonsense, but this group of Australians before him had such heavy cannons! Thinking of this, he couldn't help but feel terrified. The largest cannon on his own ships couldn't compare to the Franks' Red Barbarian cannons. If he came to Bopu to suppress the Australians, presumably he'd be blown to smithereens before even gettting close.

Thinking of this, he couldn't help rejoicing that he had listened to Jiang Youling back then. If he had really come to suppress them, a defeat would have been getting off lightly; the whole army could have been annihilated.

Turning his thoughts, his mood became very heavy again. Looking at this situation, the Australians were calculating the same way as the Franks and the Red-haired barbarians in the Tianqi era, preparing to build a city at Bopu and stay long-term. If so, the court would issue a decree for suppression sooner or later.

But not this year, Tang Yunwen thought. Recently, the Eastern Barbarians suddenly bypassed Mongolia to enter the pass, capturing several cities in succession, with soldiers pointing directly at Zunhua, shaking the capital. The court probably had no time to deal with this matter right now. If the local authorities conducted an encirclement and suppression campaign, it would likely be a joint suppression by Guangdong and Fujian...
