# Chapter 293: Sweet Port Turbulence — Funds in Place

It turned out that the people Pepi had prepared to introduce to Guo Yi were all children of officials and gentry who frequently lingered at the Purple Clarity Pavilion. Speaking of status, they weren't excessively high—either the son of a Grain Intendant, the young master or brother-in-law of a Vice General or Regional Commander, or the junior owner or nephew of a shopkeeper from a large business. They had some money in hand and mostly held some form of official degree. People with money and leisure naturally liked excitement. A place like Purple Clarity Pavilion, which often had novel things, was naturally a place they frequently connected with.

"There are a few young masters who want to meet you. They are all wealthy owners. It probably won't be hard for you to pull some funds from them."

"I know about borrowing funds, but I didn't expect them to eagerly beg to see me. It's rare for creditors to be anxious to meet the borrower." Guo Yi was a bit surprised. The people he usually met were a mixed bag, including business partners and people from officialdom, but he rarely saw such young masters and dandies—they didn't do business, nor did they have demands, so they naturally wouldn't want to see him.

"It's just that they heard you are a guest from overseas and got curious." Pepi smiled gracefully. She then recounted the details. It started with Pepi's casual chats while entertaining guests. When wealthy guests came to Purple Clarity Pavilion to squander money, she, as the hostess, naturally had to accompany them for a while as a decoration. During the chat, she would talk about various sights and sounds of Australia for entertainment. These stories were originally materials approved by the Propaganda Department in Lingao, mainly promoting various benefits and strange tales of Australia, including fabricated history, mostly things like "Overseas Strange Tales." But they also included much content that the Transmigration Group preached to the people of the Ming Dynasty.

Such stories were inherently unique. The ingenuity of Australian goods, including the various novel amusements and enjoyments provided by this Purple Clarity Pavilion, combined with Pepi's eloquence and detailed rendering, made many people deeply interested in Guo Yi, the proprietor of Purple Clarity Pavilion.

When hedonistic sons made friends, they never befriended plain and upright gentlemen; they insisted on making friends with "interesting" characters—either articulate, outstanding in appearance, or unconventional in conduct. These people kept pestering Pepi, wanting to meet the somewhat mysterious "Proprietor Guo."

"So that's how it is," Guo Yi thought. It didn't matter; it was a time to expand his network anyway, and establishing some connections would always be beneficial.

"Don't look down on them just because they are ordinary young masters; their family assets are quite substantial." Saying this, Pepi gently flipped her wrist, and an emerald ring sparkled on her finger. "This is their generosity."

This ring had a market value of at least 800 taels of silver; this generosity could not be considered small.

"Is this gift too heavy? There's no free lunch in the world." Guo Yi couldn't help but worry.

"Where did you eat for free?" Pepi acted bored, lifting her pinky to look at the new nail art on her finger.

"?!" Guo Yi looked surprised.

Pepi knew he had misunderstood and stomped her foot in embarrassment and anxiety. "You person, why do your thoughts always wander to the crooked path all day long!" Saying this, she stomped her foot and was about to go inside.

"Misunderstanding, misunderstanding, don't go, don't go—" Guo Yi quickly grabbed her, feeling like he had become the protagonist in a soap opera.

"Hmph." Pepi turned back. "I am Proprietor Guo's person. No matter how hedonistic they are, they can't have ideas about me. Even if they do, Lixiu cannot yield—"

"Alright, alright." Guo Yi shuddered and quickly changed the topic. "So how did you deal with it?"

"What's there to deal with? They have a request, so I gave them what they liked—it wasn't hard." Pepi smiled. "What they seek is naturally to meet you, Proprietor Guo."

Without further discussion, a maid came to report moments later: The young masters had arrived.

"Invite them to the Bamboo Garden to meet," Pepi ordered.

"Bamboo Garden? You built a small garden?" Guo Yi felt strange; he hadn't seen the order for this project.

"It's actually just a private room. I gave it a nice name," Pepi said, and went in to change her outfit. When she came out, she had changed into a thin dark-patterned purple velvet dress, which further set off her tall figure and the charm of her plump skin.

Guided by the maid, the two walked through the corridor, went down the stairs, and turned corners. Guo Yi said, "Your place is like a maze!"

Pepi said, "The place is too cramped, and the layout is a bit messy. If we have the spare capacity, it would be best to renovate it."

The implication was dissatisfaction with Purple Clarity Pavilion's facilities. Purple Clarity Pavilion was originally an old building that had been acquired and modified. At that time, Lingao's industrial system was still a blank slate, and the Executive Committee was unwilling to invest too many modern things here, so they could only renovate it according to the capabilities of this timeline. Because they were anxious to open up the situation, and the original decorations and facilities were still sixty or seventy percent new, they didn't make major adjustments or changes.

Guo Yi deeply agreed. With Pei Lixiu's appearance and conversation, although she attracted many dandies with temporary novel packaging, it was not a long-term plan after all. To keep Purple Clarity Pavilion prosperous for a long time, there had to be constantly renewed tricks to lead Guangzhou's fashion trends.

Thinking of this, Guo Yi slowly said, "If you hadn't mentioned this, I would have forgotten. Lingao sent a list of the latest goods. Take a look later and see if there is anything that can be used in Purple Clarity Pavilion. Calculate it before thinking about the renovation."

"If you ask me, we must first install a batch of sanitary ware, it's too inconvenient now..." Just as she was about to continue, seeing they were almost there, she quickly switched to a tone that was cloying enough to kill: "Proprietor, watch your step."

Although the Bamboo Garden was called a private room, it was actually a small flower hall. The decoration was quite elegant, but unfortunately, the furnishings were a bit old. Two pretty maids were serving in the hall. The two guests both had the style of noble young masters in fine clothes.

After the host and guests bowed to each other, Pepi introduced the new acquaintances to Guo Yi. She was right; they were typical hedonistic sons. One was Wu Zhixiang, whose father and brothers were all capital officials, and he himself was a *xiucai*. The other, Dong Jizhong, was even more unexpected; he was the son of a Vice General and had inherited the hereditary position of a Commander.

"So it is an *Official*! Disrespect, disrespect." Guo Yi bowed again.

"What official. A hereditary sesame-sized official," Dong Jizhong looked indifferent. "Someone like me, could I really go to battle wielding a knife and gun?"

He looked like a frail scholar; it was hard to imagine that a descendant of a hereditary military family would be like this. However, since this person was in Guangdong, his father must be serving as an official in Fujian or Guangdong. If this line was grasped, news from the Ming military would be much easier to obtain in the future.

They expressed admiration for each other. Since it was noon, Pei Lixiu opened the banquet in the hall. A large round table had already been pieced together in the center. On the blue and white fine porcelain tableware on the table, twelve cold dishes were laid out. Guo Yi had been here a long time and knew that Ming Dynasty banquets, whether official banquets or elegant gatherings, did not have this routine. This typical 20th-century banquet serving method, along with many of the dishes, was transplanted by Pepi from the 20th century—she had brought many cooking utensils and books.

Guo Yi swept his eyes over it. Not only were the dishes common varieties seen in public and private banquets in another dimension, but even the table setting looked familiar, and he couldn't help but smile knowingly.

Because it was an elegant gathering, there were no fixed seats. Since the gentlemen were treating Guo Yi, they pushed him to sit at the head seat, and Guo Yi did not decline.

The conversation at the table inevitably drifted to various anecdotes and strange stories about Australia. Thanks to the Internet, Guo Yi had a lot of random things in his head, from astronomy and geography to social news; he could arrange them however he liked. He knew that these remarks were just an introduction, and the important topic would inevitably follow.

Sure enough, after three rounds of drinks, Wu Zhixiang went straight to the main topic. It turned out that although these people were children of officials, they had been staying in Guangzhou and had contracted some merchant habits. They had "some private silver" in their hands and wanted to engage in some "profitable operations."

Profitable operations were easy to talk about, but for children of officials like them, it was not very convenient. They didn't know much about the ways of the business world, nor did they dare to rashly intervene. Although lending money was profitable, the risk was high, and it also involved reputation. If some "Censor" or Supervising Secretary heard about it and reported it, the lightest punishment would be a comment of "competing with the people for profit," which was highly inappropriate.

The easiest and safest way was to deposit it in a suitable large business house to earn interest, which was both safe and avoided gossip. But Wu Zhixiang disliked the low interest.

After thinking about it, the most profitable business in Guangzhou was maritime trade. Shiploads of porcelain, medicinal materials, raw silk, and tea were shipped out, and what came back was gleaming white silver; anyone would be jealous seeing it. Wu Zhixiang had been thinking about this.

But although Wu Zhixiang's father and brothers were officials in the capital, they were not influential big shots after all. Dong Jizhong's father was just a Vice General, and military ranks had always been worthless. Moreover, serving as an official in a foreign place, there was no one local to flatter them by letting them "insert shares" to carry goods or invest to make a small fortune. As for operating a ship to go to sea themselves, hearing about the perilous storms and pirates, the two really didn't have the guts. Entrusting others, they couldn't rest assured...

Dong Jizhong also interrupted from the side, "They say maritime trade is a guaranteed profit, but the storms at sea are perilous. Zheng the Traitor—" he paused, "—Although Zheng Zhilong has accepted amnesty, the sea is still treacherous with three-foot waves even without wind! Very dangerous!" He smiled bitterly. "We have silver in vain, but we can't spend it."

After rambling to this point, Guo Yi already knew that these were just ordinary hedonistic sons. They were jealous watching others get rich, but didn't want to bear any risk or hardship, so they came to find him—such characters were easy to handle. He nodded immediately and said casually, "The sea is indeed turbulent; it is truly not a good business. You are both sons of a thousand gold; you cannot do such a business."

Although they had given up the idea of maritime trade, the thought of making money hadn't changed. Dong Jizhong thought that in today's Guangzhou, another big money-making business was Australian goods. A mirror sent to Jiangnan would double the profit, and to the capital, it would add another half. The items were small, easy to carry and transport, and extremely easy to sell. It was much safer than risking large sums of money to go to sea for trade.

Another advantage was that because Wu Zhixiang's father and brother were in the capital, he often went or sent people to the capital to handle affairs. Every time the Wu family would take the opportunity of entering and leaving the capital to carry a large amount of goods for sale along the way. This kind of business, using official posts for trafficking, not only required no tax at checkpoints, but all expenses on the road were borne by the courier stations, and even the porters could be handled by the courier stations along the way.

The two hit it off immediately. Capital, they had. But the Gao family monopolized the wholesale of Australian goods in the Guangzhou market. Thinking of getting some supply from his mouth was no different from snatching food from a tiger's mouth. Although Gao Ju was just a small commoner, he was connected to people in the palace, and it was heard that he was also connected to pirates; how could they dare to provoke him? As for Guo Yi, they had long heard of his name, but they had no interaction with him, and without a suitable intermediary, rashly visiting him might result in not even seeing him; even if they saw him, it would be too degrading if word got out.

Thinking about it, they thought of Pei Lixiu of Purple Clarity Pavilion. Hearing that this place was Guo Yi's property, then Pei Lixiu, who presided over Purple Clarity Pavilion's business, must be the number one favorite beside Proprietor Guo, a favored concubine. If she introduced them and said a few good words at the critical moment, things would be much easier to accomplish.

Having made up their minds, the two came to Purple Clarity Pavilion every day, fawning over Pepi in every way, not hesitating to bribe her with heavy gifts. The goal was to have her whisper pillow talk, meet Guo Yi, and persuade this "God of Wealth of Australia" to leak some goods from between his fingers, which they could enjoy endlessly.

"...Such a sum of money can't be used. We want to ask Proprietor Guo for advice on how we can use it to generate profit?" Dong Jizhong said. Although the words were polite, the meaning was clear: the only thing in Guo Yi's hands that guaranteed money was Australian goods.

Guo Yi knew he had encountered an excellent opportunity, so he calculated carefully for a while. Since they had money they couldn't spend, it was idle money. Not only could it be borrowed in the short term, but if handled well, this fund could be occupied for long-term operations. He just didn't know exactly how much they had. Presumably, one person would have 10,000 or 20,000 of silver.

But he didn't express his attitude at this moment; he would whet their appetites first. He only responded vaguely: "Easy to discuss, easy to discuss."

"What wine will the master drink?" Pei Lixiu said, "Wine has already been prepared."

"Just wine."

These days, whenever there was a banquet, Guo Yi drank "National Scholar Unrivaled," purely to advertise his own wine. He was a bit sick of drinking it. Hearing there was wine, he felt like rain after a long drought.

There were also wine sales in Guangzhou of the Ming Dynasty. One was foreign goods, transported in wooden barrels, no different from 20th-century wine; the other was just yellow wine with raisins added. A place like Purple Clarity Pavilion naturally used the former.

Wine was poured into the glass cup, crimson and beautiful. Guo Yi lifted it and drank a small mouthful. The wine taste wasn't astringent, but had some original sweet and sour taste; it indeed had a familiar fruity aroma of wine. He couldn't help but say, "Good wine!"
