# Chapter 538 - The Hearing

Someone had called Dugu Qiuhun from here that night. Though Dugu Qiuhun could not be certain it was this call that told him "they're besieging the Executive Committee," Ji Xin considered this unknown call the most suspicious.

Still, judging by how grimy the phone's protective sleeve was, hoping to lift useful fingerprints was pure fantasy. And even if prints were recovered, it would be meaningless—this was a high-traffic area with constant foot traffic.

But the existence of this phone convinced Ji Xin of one thing: Dugu Qiuhun was not innocent, but he had played a pitiable role.

Ji Xin asked the transmigrator on duty that night who had visited the Recreation Hall. The attendant produced the equipment-usage log, which showed who had been here for entertainment. But the attendant told him that people who did not use any equipment did not need to sign in, and coming and going was completely casual.

As for who had made a phone call, the attendant had no recollection. Phone calls cost nothing; no one would have reason to pay attention to the public phone.

Whoever did this was quite slick, Ji Xin thought. There was no point in pursuing who made the call. Even if the person could be identified, they could simply deny it. Besides, calling Dugu Qiuhun to say "they're besieging the Executive Committee" was not against the law.

Finally, he went to the Police Reserve Company headquarters to meet Li Yayang.

Li Yayang still seemed spooked when Ji Xin mentioned that night's events—evidently the twelve hours at Political Security had not been pleasant. At first he refused to say more, relenting only when Ji Xin produced his commission.

"Dugu really screwed me!" Li Yayang complained in his office. "I was grilled back and forth for almost a whole day. They nearly drove me crazy." He sighed. "My future looks bleak."

"You're wrong about that," Ji Xin said. "Right now, this is just the procedural investigation phase. You stood on principle and refused to deploy your unit—your career is bound to take off."

"I hope so." Li Yayang said. "What do you want to ask? I've told Political Security a hundred times already—the only thing left is what color underwear I was wearing that night."

"Definitely not pink." Ji Xin cracked a joke. "Tell me about that night."

So Li Yayang recounted the events once more. Ji Xin had long since memorized his deposition and mentally cross-checked as he listened—there were no discrepancies.

Finally, he asked: "Besides telling Political Security about that night, have you told anyone else?"

"No." Li Yayang shook his head firmly. "You're the second. Political Security warned me at the time: until the matter is resolved, none of this may be discussed outside."

Ji Xin nodded. Li Yayang had not talked; Dugu Qiuhun had no one to talk to; Political Security's materials were classified. Yet Li Yunxing—who was neither acquainted with them nor connected to the incident in any way—knew about it, and claimed "it's all over the Fortress"!

Ji Xin returned to his office and, based on the investigation materials, wrote a thorough report. Since there was no key evidence, he decided to include no conclusions or speculative conclusions—only a factual listing of his findings. The facts would speak for themselves.

He found Ma Jia and handed over the materials. After reading them, Ma Jia asked, "What do you intend to do?"

"First, circulate copies to all Executive Committee members," Ji Xin said. "Then to all Senators attending the hearing."

"Damn it! Running a newspaper like this—how is it any different from empty talk!" Shan Liang slammed the *Lingao Times Internal Edition* onto the table.

Ding Ding had recently merged the *Lingao Times* with the old *Internal Newsletter*, creating one paper with two editions. The public edition was distributed to the indigenous population; the internal edition was for transmigrators only. The internal edition was classified as secret—only a hundred copies were printed daily, and none was allowed outside Bairen Fortress.

The internal edition mainly carried exploratory essays on the transmigrated collective's institutions and future direction, along with government bulletins and current-affairs news. It also included some entertainment content.

What enraged Shan Liang was a serialized piece of reportage literature entitled *The Sugar War*, describing how the Leizhou Station had defeated the old Haiyi Hall in Xuwen, complete with some heart-stopping passages. The author was unknown, but the narrative was gripping and suspenseful, with a cliffhanger at the end of every installment.

This piece was obviously the result of the Leizhou Station's local PR efforts. What angered Shan Liang most was this: the newspaper was supposed to be a tool of public oversight and had now become a tool for whitewashing vested-interest groups. Shan Liang did not know the details of the Leizhou Station's early frontier work, but he naturally assumed there was considerable fabrication and exaggeration.

"The Leizhou Station really has had it tough. Tooting their own horn a bit isn't a crime," Cheng Mo said. He had been deliberately cultivating closeness to Shan Liang lately and had become one of his confidants.

"But this way, public opinion will swing toward Chang Shide, and his behavior will seem justified!" Shan Liang was very displeased.

"Errors are errors; achievements are achievements—they mustn't be conflated. At the hearing, we just need to hold to that," Cheng Mo advised. "Pin him down on the misappropriation-of-funds issue and make him explain."

"Right!" Shan Liang had been elected to the Standing Committee at this General Assembly—a small gain. Though several of his motions had failed, winning the right to protest and demonstrate was a major victory. Shan Liang clearly understood that in parliamentary struggle, he was no match for the current ruling faction. Only the banner of "public opinion" could produce a certain deterrent effect.

"Chang Shide is just one example. Within the entire overseas-station system, corruption like this can't be rare," Cheng Mo said. "Seize this opportunity to demand a thorough audit and overhaul!"

"Exactly! They can't keep using collective property as they please!" Shan Liang recalled the Guangzhou–Leizhou personnel's frequent activities in Lingao before and after the Assembly—very suspicious. Suddenly, a suspicion struck him: could these people be engaging in bribery, buying off Executive Committee members and Senators?

He voiced this concern to Cheng Mo.

"It's possible they're handing out local specialties and gifts to build rapport; outright bribery is unlikely," Cheng Mo said. Given the transmigrated collective's peculiar circumstances, bribing Executive Committee members was very difficult. Gold and silver were meaningless to transmigrators. Circulation coupons were limited in both quantity and scope; receiving large amounts would be tantamount to self-incrimination—and there was nowhere to spend them anyway. As for offering women as sexual bribes—with all eyes watching inside Bairen Fortress, that was even more impossible.

"Cultivating goodwill is essentially bribery. Hundreds of millions in bribes start with a few bottles of liquor and a box of pastries! I think we need to nip this in the bud." Shan Liang scribbled rapidly in his little notebook.

Cheng Mo thought: Shan Liang is getting deeper and deeper into his role. Who knew change would come so fast? Watching Shan Liang throw himself into political activism so enthusiastically, Cheng Mo felt a twinge of guilt about his own mission. Shan Liang was playing an above-board "open stratagem," while his own group had more than a touch of sneakiness.

Still, our goals are the same, he told himself.

The hearing formally convened a few days later.

The venue was the small screening room inside the Recreation Hall. Tables were arranged in a horseshoe shape; the person being questioned sat in the open center, in the direct line of sight of everyone. Ma Jia thought: no matter who you were, the experience would not be pleasant.

The twenty-five Senators attending were selected by lot from the fifty-three Standing Senators, to ensure relative impartiality. Selected Senators could not decline except for urgent reasons.

Whether the person questioned was guilty would be decided by the vote of these twenty-five Standing Senators. The specific punishment would then be determined by the Honor Court or the Executive Committee.

Under the rules Ma Jia had designed: a guilty verdict required a 19-to-6 vote; a not-guilty verdict required only 13-to-12.

Convicting a Senator—though in most cases not a capital crime—would deal a heavy blow to the individual's future. Extreme caution was warranted. The Senators raised no objection to this rule.

Besides these twenty-five Senators, there was the three-person tribunal panel presiding over the session: Ma Jia, representing the Arbitration Tribunal, chaired it—he was also serving concurrently as presiding judge of the Honor Court. Ji Xin, who had led the investigation, and Mu Quan, who served as clerk. The Executive Committee had sent Xiao Zishan as its representative. These four could speak but could not vote.

Ji Xin arrived at the venue early with all the materials. Ma Jia saw him carrying a large rattan case on his back, heavy and stuffed with documents, sweat dripping from his brow.

"You could have had an indigenous clerk help you carry that."

Ji Xin said, "They're busy enough, and they're all undernourished kids. Making them lug something this heavy—I'd feel bad."

"You're awfully kind."

"Hardly. Everyone's born of a mother. Exploitation should be kept within limits." Ji Xin pulled a clean set of camouflage fatigues from the case and changed into them.

Ma Jia nodded. Appearance in court was important—it conveyed the authority and solemnity of the law.

Chang Shide arrived at the venue flanked by Yan Maoda and other Guangzhou and Leizhou overseas-station personnel, plus several people Ma Jia did not recognize. He was impeccably groomed; even his clothes had been changed to a neatly pressed casual outfit, and for some reason he wore a pair of black-framed glasses. He looked the picture of honest reliability.

Someone's been coaching Chang Shide, Ma Jia thought. He looks exactly like an American murder suspect appearing in court.

Dugu Qiuhun's arrival was far more wretched: hair disheveled, dressed in a wrinkled fatigue uniform, with two Political Security officers escorting him. He was led to a back-row seat to await his turn as the second to be questioned.
