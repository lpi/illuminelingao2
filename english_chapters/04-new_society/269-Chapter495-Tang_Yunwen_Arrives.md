# Chapter 495 - Tang Yunwen Arrives

Huang Ande briefly laid out the mission: the Chief's determination, the enemy situation, and the concrete implementation plan. According to the map markings, this area contained a fairly sizable refugee settlement, with around forty to fifty shacks within a five-square-kilometer radius. It was estimated that the population living in this area was no less than one hundred.

For ten people to catch a hundred in such a large area with complex terrain was essentially an impossible mission. But they had two advantages. First, Huang Ande knew the specific location of every shack and the best route to reach them. Second, the distance between shacks was at least two or three hundred meters, separated by many hills, woods, and tall grass. As long as they moved quickly and kept quiet, they could arrest them one by one.

The squad then discussed the route of action, deciding to set up a temporary holding point in a relatively central and hidden location within the operation area. They would capture multiple people before escorting them back together, avoiding wasting time and energy running back and forth. They also verified communication methods and signals repeatedly until ensuring everyone knew them by heart.

"Alright, move out!"

The arrest operation lasted two days. Huang Ande successfully completed the mission, capturing over a hundred refugees and seizing a batch of production materials and grain.

Wang Ruixiang ordered all people and goods sent to Bairun City for processing. The captured refugees, eyes wide with terror and confusion, were tied into columns of ten and led away. As for the small patches of land they had reclaimed, because they were too scattered and inaccessible, they were all abandoned to fallow.

As for the land confiscated from Fu Yousan's family, Wu De instructed that it be rented to Fu Buer for cultivation first to avoid leaving it fallow, with the harvest split 40-60 between the state and the tenant.

Outside Bopu Harbor, Qiongzhou Strait.

"This is Bopu?" Surprise revealed itself in the voice.

The questioner was about forty, his face dark and chapped, evidently the result of years of exposure to sea winds. His eyes were very spirited. He stood on the deck of a two-masted fishing boat common in the Qiongzhou Strait, gazing at Bopu Harbor in the distance.

"Yes, My Lord." The person beside him answered quietly and respectfully.

"You forgot again!" The middle-aged man addressed as 'My Lord' rebuked him dissatisfiedly.

"Yes, yes, Master."

"Does anyone call a fisherman 'Master'?" The middle-aged man was unhappy with his subordinate's inability to adapt. "Call me Boss." Saying this, he fished out a bamboo tube from under a basket of fish and shrimp. Opening it, a black object slid out. This was one of the rarest items in China at the time—a Dutch-made monocular telescope. It had been bought from the Portuguese in Macao. Only a few coastal generals in Guangdong and Fujian had seized the opportunity to acquire this rarity. It should be known that this thing had been invented in Europe less than twenty years ago.

The middle-aged man brought the telescope to his eye, closed one eye as the Red-haired barbarians had taught him, and slowly pulled the tube. The field of vision gradually cleared, and he immediately trembled: he saw the battery on the embankment of Lingao Cape.

This battery was certainly not built by the Ming army. The middle-aged man was very clear on this point. He looked carefully; the style of this battery was different from ordinary batteries, bearing some resemblance to the "Western-style platforms" advocated by Lord Sun Yuanhua. It seemed the rumors were indeed true!

This man holding the telescope was none other than the person mentioned daily by the transmigrator group's military and intelligence departments: Tang Yunwen, Assistant Regional Commander of the White Sand Water Fortress, concurrently in charge of Qiongya Land Forces and other places, Assistant Commander of the Imperial Bodyguard.

From this long title, one could know that this person was the highest-ranking garrison commander of the Ming Dynasty on Hainan Island, controlling both naval and land forces on the island. In the first battle between the transmigrator group and the Ming government, nine times out of ten, it would be fought against his troops.

Tang Yunwen had not learned of the transmigrator group's arrival late. On D-Day itself, the beacon towers reported to him: Lingao's beacon tower signaled alarm; pirates were invading. This wasn't fresh news: pirate invasions in this area were commonplace. The garrison forces lacked the strength to respond to each one, employing nothing more than the strategy of "strictly guarding camps and cities, waiting for thieves to leave on their own." Therefore, it didn't attract much of his attention. More than ten days later, he received a plea for help from the Lingao County Yamen, claiming a group of "overseas magnates" had landed in Lingao and were currently building camps with intentions of "long-term occupation," asking him to send troops quickly to expel them.

Given his duties, such a plea naturally warranted sending someone for an on-site investigation before deciding whether to deploy troops. But the situation Tang Yunwen faced made it impossible for him to deploy troops easily.

Tang Yunwen had a big title. Theoretically, all naval and land garrisons on Hainan Island, including recruited soldiers and Wei-Suo troops, were under his command. In reality, the main force truly available for combat at any time was only over two thousand men, mainly naval forces stationed at the White Sand Water Fortress in Haikou Battalion. In fact, "Assistant Regional Commander of White Sand Water Fortress" was where his real authority lay. Those were the only troops he could use for fighting.

As for the Wei-Suo troops stationed everywhere on the island, apart from barely being used to "pacify the Li people," they had no function.

With a naval force of less than three thousand, he still had to dispatch a considerable portion to patrol Huichang, Changning, Yangjiao, and other places around the island. Yet they faced unprecedented coastal defense pressure. The waters off late-Ming Guangdong were filled with pirates of all stripes and sizes: professional pirates, merchant-pirates, and coastal fishermen moonlighting as pirates. Westerners also appeared occasionally to add to the excitement—Portuguese, Spanish, British, and Dutch traded while robbing, also looking for opportunities to find a foothold here.

As the saying goes, too many fleas don't itch, too much debt doesn't worry. Tang Yunwen had become completely numb to this coastal defense situation where smoke rose everywhere and fires started all over. No matter how Wu Mingjin pleaded in his letters or how serious the situation was described—Tang Yunwen remained unmoved.

The gesture he made was dispatching two patrol boats to check Bopu—originally a coastal defense regulation; maritime patrols of Qiongzhou's West Route were supposed to visit Lingao waters every four days. But in recent years, money and grain had been extremely tight, and military pay had never been issued in full—barely maintainable without fighting. But the navy was expensive; ships needed repairs and replacement. Even without fighting, losses at sea needed to be replenished. The cost of one ship was much higher than the lives of dozens or hundreds of soldiers. Tang Yunwen hadn't received new ships for years, and even the annual public funds for ship repairs were often deducted. To ensure ships were available in case of war, he had to minimize sailing frequencies. The result was that the patrol system became a mere formality.

Tang Yunwen could only hope the appearance of his patrol boats would scare off the pirates—if the opponent was powerful and disregarded his two boats, he was helpless. Just as he had been helpless against Zhu Cailao and Zhong Lingxiu all these years, and recently helpless against Liu Xiang.

However, the chiliarch leading the returning patrol boats looked as if he had been greatly frightened. Pale-faced, he incoherently said that a "big iron ship as high as a city wall" had come to Bopu Bay. Not to mention government warships, even the Red-haired barbarians' "clip-board ships," the largest on these seas, were like sampans compared to it.

Tang Yunwen didn't believe it. After repeated questioning and his subordinate swearing oaths to heaven and making extremely definitive answers, he sent his trusted officers to investigate. The equally pale-faced trusted officers returned saying the news was true. This shocked him no small amount—if the opponent had such huge ships, wouldn't they be invincible on the Guangdong seas? These overseas visitors were clearly not the Red-haired barbarians or Franks he was familiar with. Nor were they simply here to rob—what wealth did Lingao have worth bringing such a giant ship to rob?

Tang Yunwen fell into a dilemma. According to his duty, regardless of what this group intended to do in Great Ming, unauthorized anchoring and setting up camp on shore was highly improper. He should immediately send troops to Lingao to drive these overseas visitors away. But to deploy troops—leaving aside everything else, who would pay for the provisions and pay for this expedition? Counting on the Guangdong Provincial Treasury was hopeless; since Wei Zhongxian had transferred the thirty-odd thousand taels of silver accumulated in the Guangdong Treasury to the capital for major construction projects at the end of the Tianqi reign, the treasury had been destitute. As for Qiongzhou Prefecture, it definitely couldn't come up with this money either. Lingao was even less to be counted on.

Without money, one couldn't fight. Even with money to fight, he had absolutely no confidence in winning. How to deal with such a tall iron ship? Based on his past experience dealing with Western big ships, since opponent ships were tall and cannons had long range, the Ming army couldn't gain an advantage whether boarding or engaging in artillery duels. They mostly used fire attacks against ships as their main combat method, often receiving good results. Now the opponent was a fire-and-water-proof iron ship; what could be done?

In desperation, he could only ask his advisors for strategies. The advisors spoke all at once. Some suggested sending braves to board the ship at night using grappling hooks; others proposed making dozens of extra-large "River-Roiling Dragons" (primitive naval mines) and sending small boats to sneak into the harbor to release them...

As they spoke enthusiastically, one advisor among them said: "Everyone is offering strategies to defeat the enemy, but may I ask: where is the grain? Where is the pay?"

The signing room instantly fell silent. The advisors looked at each other. This was the key issue.

"War is the worst policy given the current countermeasures." The speaker was surnamed Jiang, named Youling, a Juren by background and an old hand in officialdom.

Jiang Youling's proposal was: dispatching troops was absolutely out of the question. Money and grain were one aspect—the opponent having giant ships meant their strength was certainly extraordinary. Rashly dispatching troops would nine out of ten result in defeat.

Defeat was hard to explain away. As long as they didn't fight, there would be no problem of defeat.

As for pirates landing and robbing, this happened almost every day along the Guangdong and Fujian coasts; it was nothing major. As long as the Lingao county seat didn't fall, regardless of whether there was a big iron ship, it was just ordinary pirates landing to rob.

Anyway, this method of muddling through and deceiving superiors but not subordinates hadn't been used for just a day or two. After discussing back and forth, everyone felt this countermeasure was the most appropriate. So Tang Yunwen simply played deaf and mute, turning a blind eye.
