# Chapter 501 - Penetrating Qiongshan

Lin Baiguang had given the two of them a generous operational budget, wanting to see their attitude toward using the funds. Would they squander the money as soon as they got their hands on a large sum, or did they know how to spend wisely?

How to find a safe house, how to gather intelligence, how to use operational funds—all of this had been taught in training. Whether they could put their lessons into practice would be proven in this field test.

After briefing them on their tasks, Lin Baiguang personally conducted a preliminary reconnaissance of the environments inside and outside the prefectural city, as well as the area around Haikou Qianhu Garrison. He also observed Baisha Naval Camp from a distance and assessed Haikou's defensive infrastructure.

By the standards of this era, the overall defenses of Haikou were quite formidable. Lin Baiguang's career path had led him toward the civil service, so while he possessed some exposure to historical texts—mostly works like the *Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Government*—he had little interest in granular historical details. After D-Day, work requirements compelled him to delve into such material, and he had since acquired a basic understanding of Ming military affairs.

Baisha Naval Camp was not limited to Baisha Harbor alone; it also maintained subsidiary encampments at Dongying and Mangliao harbors. These positions formed a mutually supporting triangle around Shenying Harbor, which, together with the Haikou Rear Qianhu Garrison and the numerous fortifications to the west and south of the prefectural city, created a comprehensive defensive network guarding Qiongzhou Prefecture.

Throughout the area surrounding Shenying Harbor and the Haikou Rear Qianhu Garrison, beacon towers, watchtowers, and fortifications stood in abundance. Patrol boats crisscrossed the harbor, while chevaux-de-frise lined the shore and soldiers circulated on guard duty. The defenses appeared rigorous indeed.

Haikou served as the center of military power for the entire island of Hainan and as a crucial hub of coastal defense—such scale was hardly surprising.

Nevertheless, Lin Baiguang concluded that breaking through this defensive network would not be particularly difficult for the transmigrated collective's current military strength. If they waited until their projected five-year mark to attack, it would be child's play.

The brick-and-stone artillery emplacements were everywhere, equipped mostly with antiquated Portuguese-style breech-loading swivel guns—even *huzhun* crouching-tiger cannons, bowl-mouth cannons, and bamboo-jointed *poluo hu* pieces that were even more archaic. Newly copied Western cannons remained scarce. Even by the military standards of this era, the armaments here were already obsolete.

It appeared the Ming government's military reforms in Guangdong had not yet reached Hainan's coastal defenses. Still, even if every fortification here were rebuilt by the finest seventeenth-century Western military engineers and every cannon replaced by red-barbarian artillery, they would still crumble before the transmigrators' firepower.

After a full day's inspection, Lin Baiguang was confident in his assessment. He reflected that seizing all of Hainan posed no significant challenge to the transmigrated collective now; the true difficulty lay in the absence of administrative personnel and garrison forces to hold it afterward—victory would be hollow without the ability to consolidate.

Upon returning to the temple, he drafted his first report to Lingao. In it, he proposed that the Qiongzhou intelligence station could serve as a "practical training base" for cultivating intelligence operatives. The local social environment was relatively straightforward, and the Ming governmental apparatus here was comparatively weak. Should something go wrong, a rescue operation could be mounted quickly.

His second proposal was to use Qiongzhou as a springboard for intelligence work across Guangdong. The Guangzhou Station currently handled all Guangdong operations, but Lin Baiguang argued that Guangzhou bore too heavy an economic burden and that Guo Yi and his colleagues already had high profiles there; conducting large-scale clandestine operations further would entail substantial risk. Any mishap could deal a devastating blow to the transmigrated collective's economy. He therefore recommended that intelligence work outside the Pearl River Delta be spun off to the Qiongzhou Station for execution, with Guangzhou providing only support.

As for Lin Baiguang's own cover identity in the region, after careful consideration he decided to open a grain shop in Qiongshan County. The transmigrated collective had invested in a grain business in Leizhou, from which experienced managers and clerks could be transferred, and existing trade relationships could be leveraged. This made for an ideal front.

Rice was a daily necessity for everyone. Lingao now had many new products available for sale, virtually all of which could open sizable markets here, yet Lin Baiguang had no intention of performing commercial miracles in this locale. He needed only a cover identity that allowed him to move freely throughout Guangdong. As such, he would avoid dealing in any goods associated with "Lingao."

Regarding scale, nothing large was necessary. A capital stock of one thousand *shi* of brown rice would suffice; he would simply conduct ordinary business. In the future, once the transmigrated collective controlled all of Hainan, the grain shop—as a key facility influencing the food distribution sector—could continue to serve a useful purpose without waste.

Gao Di and Chen Tong had been out for several days running, leaving early and returning late. Lin Baiguang stayed holed up in his room, plotting future intelligence operations; he did not inquire about their progress. Finally, Gao Di came back to report. He had identified several prospective properties.

Lin Baiguang listened as Gao Di described each property's location, layout, and features in detail, including the terms of sale.

Gao Di had shortlisted three properties, all located outside the city walls—small compounds of one or two courtyards. All were available for either purchase or rent. Two were moderately priced; a third, situated on West Gate Avenue, commanded a higher price because it included street-facing shopfronts.

"This property has three bays of storefront space," Gao Di explained. "The front courtyard is large enough for a warehouse. If we need a business as cover, it's a suitable location. There's also a small rear courtyard—very quiet—and the back gate opens onto an area with access in all directions."

The price was two hundred eighty taels, inclusive of fees for middlemen and guarantors. Given the property's condition, the figure was not unreasonable.

Observing Gao Di's dust-covered appearance and hoarse voice, Lin Baiguang knew the young man had expended considerable effort over the past few days. Yet his results were commendable. Moreover, the property he had found matched Lin Baiguang's requirements. It was clear that Gao Di could not only execute orders effectively but also think proactively about how to complete his tasks better—a rare quality.

Chen Tong reported that Hai Shuzu was a descendant of Hai Rui. Thanks to his ancestor's renown, he was considered one of the local gentry in Qiongshan County. However, the Hai family's circumstances were modest. To uphold their forebear's reputation, the family had always abided by the law and avoided improper dealings, subsisting on a small ancestral estate. Supporting a large household on such limited means was a constant strain. Hai Shuzu had long attempted to prosper through commerce. Recently, he had pooled funds from clan members, relatives, and friends to construct a large vessel for a trading voyage to the Western Seas. Unfortunately, they encountered pirates en route; the ship and its cargo were seized, and only the ship's manager and some sailors returned. Creditors had since descended upon him in a clamor, leaving him at his wits' end.

Most of this Lin Baiguang already knew—the ship and its cargo were currently in Lingao, under the jurisdiction of the admiralty court. At the time, they had sent the manager back and instructed Hai Shuzu to come in person to reclaim the vessel; months had passed, and he still had not appeared. Evidently, Hai Shuzu lacked boldness. Hearing now of creditors making scenes, Lin Baiguang smiled: external pressure would only make matters easier to handle.

As for Hai Shuzu's personal affairs, Chen Tong had gathered some details. Overall, the man was unremarkable—a rule-abiding scion of an illustrious family whose desire for wealth exceeded that of ordinary people—a trait common to many in the late Ming era.

"One of his household servants is from Meizhou in Guangdong," Chen Tong added. "He and I are from the same general area. I've already claimed him as a fellow townsman; getting in and out of the Hai household will be much easier from now on…"

"Very good." Lin Baiguang nodded approvingly.

Regarding expenditures, Gao Di had spent a dozen or so taels, allegedly on cultivating middlemen contacts and on purchasing silk garments and sedan-chair hire to maintain appearances.

"…Without a certain presence, the matter could not have been handled so smoothly," he explained.

"The operational funds are yours to spend as you see fit, so long as it's reasonable," Lin Baiguang said. "But your expense report is rather vague. Look at Chen Tong's—"

Chen Tong had spent only four taels and three *qian*, yet he submitted a detailed expense ledger itemizing everything from buying someone tea or a meal to gifting a pair of shoes. In comparison, Gao Di's report, with its frequent entries of merely "entertainment expense," was far less clear.

"The operational fund is entirely at your disposal, but it is still public money," Lin Baiguang admonished them. "The most important word here is 'public.' Public funds must remain free of private entanglement. We work in intelligence—large sums pass through our hands, and there are many expenditures. The more this is so, the more transparent every expense must be; every single *wen* should be accounted for clearly. Do you understand?"

"Yes."

Lin Baiguang paused and studied the two young men. "Doing your job well is certainly important, but learning to protect yourselves in the course of that work is even more so. Neglect the small details now, and when the time comes you won't be able to explain yourself. By then, protesting your innocence will be useless—no one will believe you!"

"Yes. We will remember," the two nodded.

"Good. Gao Di, go ahead and purchase the property—the one on West Gate Avenue." Lin Baiguang retrieved eighty taels of silver from the small iron chest he kept with him. "This is the deposit. The balance will be paid at closing."

"Should I spend a few more taels to have the deed registered at Qiongshan County's Revenue Office and stamped with the official seal?" Gao Di suggested.

It was a prudent idea, though in Lin Baiguang's view somewhat superfluous—in another three or four years, the Qiongshan County yamen would no longer exist, making registration pointless. Still, Gao Di's careful thinking deserved encouragement.

"Very well, proceed that way."

"Understood."

Thus, preparations for the Qiongzhou intelligence station moved briskly forward. Lin Baiguang had no intention of acting as shopkeeper himself; he knew nothing about the grain trade, so managers would be transferred from the Intelligence Commission via Leizhou Sugar. Zhu Fusheng, owner of the Dachang Rice Shop, was happy to recommend his own clerks to serve as managers and senior staff, and he expressed willingness to establish business ties with the new "Wanfeng Grain Shop."

The manager and senior clerks from Dachang would not participate in intelligence work. That fell to trainees sent from Lingao's training program, who would serve as junior clerks and servants. Separating operations into two tracks—external and internal—facilitated management and security.
