# Chapter 556 - Spoils Distribution

The OA system published a catalog of all the types and quantities of materials obtained in Matter A, along with their distribution plan. Clothing, shoes, and cigarettes would be distributed to every transmigrator as welfare in batches. Food, liquor, professional clothing, tools, equipment, and materials would be stored and distributed uniformly by the Planning Council.

Although these materials weren't of particularly great significance, they were still very welcome. Especially the clothing and shoes. Nearly two years after landing, clothes and shoes were being consumed particularly quickly. Although there was now a garment factory capable of producing hats, clothes, and shoes domestically, the styles and colors always looked rather dowdy—nothing compared to this batch of athletic casualwear. As for the shoes, that went without saying.

Regrettably, there was no underwear or socks, which were currently the items with the greatest shortage. Local products still had defects in fit and comfort.

The General Affairs Office distributed the first batch of clothing and shoes on a per-capita basis. Although there were no children's clothes or shoes, children still received a share per person to demonstrate absolute fairness. Even cigarettes were distributed absolutely equally—one carton per person regardless of gender or age. Non-smokers could use them to trade for other things.

Leather goods weren't very useful and wouldn't be distributed for now. Briefcases were listed in the "official issue supplies" catalog, to be issued to personnel who needed them.

Liquor and pornographic magazines wouldn't be distributed. Xiao Zishan transferred all the pornographic magazines to the Grand Library for collection; transmigrators could borrow them to read within the library. The whisky was reserved for emergency use.

As for other miscellaneous daily items, clothing, and objects found on the ship, these were handled through auction—listed on the BBS for anyone interested to bid on, with highest bidder winning. The Flow Vouchers earned went into a dividend-specific account, to be distributed to all transmigrators according to their shares at year's end.

The disposal method didn't cause controversy. The only point of dispute was this batch of weapons. No one competed for the CZ99 handguns, but how to distribute the automatic rifles, submachine guns, and machine guns sparked heated debate. Navy and Army officers waged fierce verbal battles on the BBS over these guns, each side laying out the importance and necessity of automatic weapons to their respective branch.

This discussion began with calm reasoning and fact-presentation, then inevitably ended with harsh words exchanged. The result, naturally, was all posts being deleted.

The argument subsequently moved to the newspapers:

"Automatic rifles, submachine guns, and machine guns have always been standard Army weapons. It's only natural for the Army to possess and use them." This appeared in an article published in the *Lingao Times* signed by "A Loyal and Fearless Army Officer."

The next day, the newspaper ran another article titled *The Application of Automatic Weapons in Boarding Combat*, expounding from a tactical perspective the importance of automatic weapons to the Navy in current naval warfare.

This Navy move was quite clever. Those who didn't understand thought it was merely academic discussion, when in reality it was "silently moistening the earth," giving the public the concept that "the Navy also needs automatic weapons."

Subsequently, the Navy published multiple "academic" articles in succession in the *Lingao Times*, including: *Tactics of Naval Infantry in Amphibious Operations Under New Conditions*, *Amphibious Special Warfare*, and so on.

These articles were either quite professional or simply fabricated, but they shared a common thread—explicitly or implicitly pointing out the importance of automatic weapons in combat.

"They're building momentum!" Wei Aiwen slapped the newspaper down on the table. Though he was now at the General Staff, he was still "an armor soldier at heart" and naturally stood with the Army. He immediately called Zhang Bailin:

"Bailin! You're falling behind! The Navy is manufacturing public opinion in the newspapers!"

"Right, I saw it too. These traitors, always playing dirty."

The transmigrators' Navy, with its system and nomenclature carrying a whiff of the old Imperial Japanese Navy—especially after the *Warship March* was officially "borrowed" as the Naval March—had this label slapped on them by the Army. Of course, the Navy's label for the Army was "Yellow Nazis." Consequently, these two terms were forbidden from being openly discussed in public venues and on the BBS to avoid provoking conflict between the two sides.

"If this keeps up, the machine guns and such might fall into the Navy's hands—or at least get split half with them." Wei Aiwen was very anxious. The Executive Committee had been discussing this issue for several days now. If they were influenced, things could go badly.

"The Navy has more pen-pushers; we don't have many people here who know how to work with that stuff." Zhang Bailin was also troubled by this matter. When it came to fighting, the Army was certainly no worse than the Navy, but when it came to refined scolding and article-writing, the Army clearly couldn't match the Navy's prowess.

"These traitors have gone too far!" Wei Aiwen cursed, then thought for a moment. "Can't write it yourself, can't you copy? Go to the library and search for all articles related to automatic weapons tactics, cobble them together and publish quickly. We must seize the position of public opinion!"

"Alright, I'll get on it immediately!" Zhang Bailin hung up the phone, found a few people to discuss, and they split up to find articles. He figured just copying existing material probably wouldn't work; it would be best to combine it with the local timeline's environment.

So he wrote a short piece himself: *The Machine Gun is Artillery*. After finishing, he felt it was rather shaky content—what was all this, anyway?—but seeing a Navy ghost-written article in the newspaper that was complete nonsense, Zhang Bailin figured they were even.

Thus the Army-Navy "academic paper war" escalated. The purpose of this sudden surge in military academic interest was obvious to anyone with discernment. After several days, with nothing more "academic" left to discuss, both sides began picking apart each other's articles for errors, implying the other side had questionable academic standards.

This "academic dispute" ultimately nearly came to blows. It was only through the forceful suppression by the Army and Navy People's Commissars that it avoided escalating into a bigger incident.

"Hmph, ready to cause trouble over a few guns—do they think we Executive Committee don't exist?!" Ma Qianzhu slammed the table and stood up. "Neither the Army nor the Navy gets a single one—everyone can go play with Minié rifles!"

In the end, the Executive Committee announced that one each of the weapons and rocket launchers obtained in Matter A would be allocated to the design group as samples for research and preservation. Twelve automatic rifles and six submachine guns would be assigned to the Special Reconnaissance Team. The remaining weapons would be stored in the armory for now. Neither the Army nor the Navy got anything, finally settling the dispute.

The final matter was disposing of the salvaged fishing vessel. This ship, codenamed "Ship A," had been secretly towed at night to a cove covered in mangroves at Bopu after being raised. Not only was this a Navy restricted zone where natives couldn't approach, but it was surrounded on all sides by mudflats and forest, making overland access nearly impossible—one had to enter by small boat. This made it convenient for secrecy and guarding.

After Ship A was towed to Bopu, basic maintenance had already been conducted: cleaning the hull inside and out and removing attached marine organisms. The hull had been temporarily sealed for preservation. Once the confidentiality level was lifted, how to repair this ship as quickly as possible became a pressing priority.

The ship was now towed by steam launch to the shipyard dock and put into drydock, awaiting comprehensive overhaul.

Various departments organized a special group including Meng De, Wang Luobin, Zhong Lishi, and Qian Shuiting from North America who had experience with small vessels. The goal was to develop a restoration and utilization plan.

Although all hull numbers, logs, and anything that could reveal the ship's origins had been completely destroyed, based on available information they could roughly determine it was a 110-ton seiner built on the American West Coast, an oceangoing fishing vessel. But it had been modified for smuggling.

Most of the fishing equipment on board had been removed except for external fixtures kept as cover. The freezer hold was still there, but the refrigeration equipment appeared to have been rarely used. The ship's propulsion system had been modified—the engine replaced with a more powerful one. Lin Chuanqing examined it and said the ship could make thirty knots; the fuel tanks had also been enlarged, giving it greater range than typical oceangoing fishing vessels.

The ship's electronic equipment was quite advanced—not only standard navigation equipment but also high-performance radar, navigation, and radio systems not normally found on fishing vessels. Unfortunately, due to seawater immersion, most equipment was no longer functional, but Zhong Lishi believed repair could be attempted.

The area around the bridge had been reinforced with steel plate. Universal mounts with suspicious purposes were installed on both sides of the bridge and at the stern—most likely for mounting machine guns or similar weapons.

"This ship is far more advanced than our 8154!" Meng De was quite excited. "Speed alone puts it in first place! It even has protective armor!"

"Can the engine assembly still be used?" Zhong Lishi was worried about the engine that had been soaking for months. "Do we have the capability for major overhaul of marine engines?"

"It's possible." Wang Luobin had studied the engine room for a long time. "We'll probably have to take it off its mounts for a full overhaul."

"That won't work!" Meng De shook his head repeatedly. He had done an internship at the shipyard. "Dismounting and mounting marine engines is technical work. Taking it down is easy—putting it back is hard! Getting the center of gravity right is critical."

But this wasn't the thorniest issue. Everyone agreed that although the ship's engine assembly had sustained some damage, with the mechanical department's capabilities it could probably be repaired. The difficulty lay in the propeller and rudder that had been bent and twisted by the reef.

"Without several years of industrial technology accumulation and equipment modification, we probably can't repair them." Wang Luobin looked and shook his head. "We can try with the rudder, but the propeller blades are a bit high-tech."

"Use reserve modern metal materials. We have CNC centers—use CAD to make drawings and machine directly."

"That's the only option. But this propeller was probably cast; a machined one might not work."

The assessment was that Ship A would likely need two or three years of repairs before returning to service. However, the various fishing equipment on board could be removed and put to use first, just like with the 8154 trawler.

As for the engine, they decided to remove it for repairs—without removal, they couldn't even clean out the seawater properly. As for the electronic equipment, all of it would be removed and given to Zhong Lishi for research—whatever could be repaired would be repaired.
