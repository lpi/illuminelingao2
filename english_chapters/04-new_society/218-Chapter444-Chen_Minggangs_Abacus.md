# Chapter 444 Chen Minggang's Abacus

Chen Minggang thanked him and sat down, his eyes rolling over Xiong Buyou's face.

"Master Xiong, please speak if you have something to say."

"Old Eight!" Xiong Buyou used Wang Zhaomin's address for him to show warmth while not lowering his own status. One should know that even the county gentry had to call him "Old Eight."

"I have a matter I need you to be straight with me about." Xiong Buyou cut to the chase—given both sides' communication abilities, being direct was easier.

He repeated Wang Zhaomin's request, then asked: "What problems are there with the county's autumn tax collection?"

"Naturally, there are problems." Chen Minggang seemed to have expected this question long ago. His unruffled expression told Xiong Buyou that he had known about this matter all along.

"Master Xiong, does Australia also collect grain tax?" Chen Minggang asked.

"Imperial grain and national tax exist everywhere under heaven. Australia is no exception." Although agricultural tax had been abolished in this space-time, it had only been abolished for a number of years.

"Does Master Xiong know how Australia collects grain tax?" Chen Minggang asked. "Are there any abuses?"

Xiong Buyou naturally didn't know this. Thinking that the government abolishing agricultural tax was partly to benefit farmers and partly to eliminate the abuse of harassing farmers, he could only say: "I'm not very clear on this. Probably there are."

"That's it then; every trade has its difficulties." Chen Minggang spoke very calmly. "Take the Great Ming for instance. The two taxes of summer and autumn every year are the court's main items. However, every county always has some wicked people who stubbornly resist paying. If the county pursues too tightly, they abandon their land and flee to other villages. For the sake of performance evaluation, the Magistrate can't pursue too tightly either..."

This sounded quite different from the Ming dynasty tax problems Xiong Buyou had heard in the Ming social conditions lecture. Besides, would tax-owing big households casually abandon their land and flee? On second thought, the Ming social conditions lecture talked about systemic abuses, and Chen Minggang was one of the biggest beneficiaries of the system—how could he speak ill of it? He decided to listen for now.

"The number of households and population in the county is the Magistrate's performance metric. If the household count drops during his term, the evaluation will look bad. So towards such wicked people, he can only—and it's inconvenient to—investigate thoroughly; just accept however much they pay."

"Do the gentry in the county pay grain tax in full?"

Chen Minggang nodded: "Master Xiong has asked the key point. According to the dynasty's rules, gentry naturally have the benefit of tax exemption. However, the gentry inevitably use the court's preferential treatment to the extreme—two hundred thousand percent. Those exempt for a few *shi* get exempt for a dozen *shi*; those exempt for a dozen *shi* get exempt for hundreds. Master Xiong must have heard of 'proxy registration,' right?"

Xiong Buyou recalled his study materials and nodded; he understood a bit now.

"Recently, has anyone brought land to cast themselves under the Noble Group?"

"That hasn't happened." As the main liaison dealing with locals, such news would be reported to Xiong Buyou according to regulations.

"It will happen soon. On the eve of the autumn tax collection, people will probably come. Master Wu is worried precisely about this, which is why he asked Private Secretary Wang to intercede with Master Xiong."

"So that's it!" Xiong Buyou understood completely. The county feared that a group of "wicked people" would rely on the Crossing Group's power to not pay autumn tax, so they hurriedly sent Wang Zhaomin to discuss tax payment with them.

If the Crossing Group were willing to take the lead in paying autumn tax, it would be a shock to all circles in Lingao. Those who originally thought of relying on the Crossing Group to pay less or no tax would have to weigh things carefully.

However, Xiong Buyou thought, things weren't that simple. He said casually:

"So, this year's autumn tax will be hard to collect, right?"

"Of course it's hard to collect." Chen Minggang answered without hesitation. "Gentlemen probably also know that in a place like Lingao, far from the emperor, wicked people are always a bit more unscrupulous. Without a villain to suppress them, it's really not easy to get things done."

Xiong Buyou thought, *Who is this "villain"? Of course, it was the Gou brothers—these two brothers often undertook the grain tax collection for Lingao. They were the county's famous "grain runners."*

"Grain runners" weren't necessarily runners from the yamen; most were local "villains," either with their own business or simply hooligans. They all had connections with the Revenue Section clerks in the county yamen. When the yamen started collecting grain, they would accompany the runners to the countryside to collect rent, taking the opportunity to extort and grab benefits.

Initially, these "grain runners" were just thugs for the clerks. Over time, certain local powerful landlords and gentry also got involved, using their power in the countryside to monopolize tax collection. They proceeded to bully commoners and squeeze peasants. After the imperial grain and national taxes were collected, they inevitably made a fortune themselves. The more unscrupulous ones would collect taxes from the small folk but keep them without handing them over, causing the county to owe taxes every year. In the late Ming and early Qing, tax arrears in various prefectures and counties in Jiangnan were extremely serious. When the Qing court cleared up old arrears, someone once said explicitly: small folk don't owe taxes; those owing taxes are all gentry and landlords who "undertake tax farming."

Xiong Buyou knew that the Gou brothers had perennially undertaken the grain tax for the county capital district and nearby areas, making a fortune from it.

Chen Minggang knew the Gou family was exterminated by them; why did he specifically say this? He pondered, and a thought flashed through his mind: *Could Chen Minggang be hinting to them that they could also do the business of undertaking tax collection?*

This coincided nicely! Xiong Buyou was somewhat excited. If this clerk also had this idea, they could greatly utilize this guy. And learn more about Lingao's tax situation from him.

But he didn't make a specific stance for the time being, just staring at Chen Minggang with interest. This posture actually made Chen Minggang somewhat unsure—he indeed intended to pull the Crossing Group in to undertake the whole county's taxes.

With the Crossing Group's prestige in Lingao, if they came forward, even just lending their banner, it would be enough to make the whole county tremble with fear—and he could take the opportunity to make a big haul. The Gou brothers were formidable initially, but there were still quite a few powerful gentry and landlords who didn't buy their act. Now with the Australians, probably no one would dare not buy this act. His personal income would naturally be much larger.

As for the specific handling, the Australians knew nothing about Great Ming's grain collection—let alone these visitors from overseas, in the whole county, besides himself, only Private Secretary Wang understood this. Although Private Secretary Wang understood, he didn't have the county's Fish Scale Registers in hand. All specific affairs would still have to listen to his arrangement...

Thinking of this, Chen Minggang even felt a bit floaty. With the "grain runner" of the Australians, who had strong ships and sharp cannons, he, Chen Minggang, could properly deal with the families who opposed him.

Chen Minggang planned to use this opportunity to fleece the county fiercely. Not only would the county commoners dare not gossip, but even Wu Mingjin and Wang Zhaomin wouldn't have the guts to object. Anyway, if the sky feel, the tall Australians would prop it up. If the Australians could stay long in Lingao in the future, or even carve out territory and open an office, his tax collection for the Australians would naturally make him a meritorious official; if the Australians were driven away by the imperial court, the blame for exorbitant levies would also be counted on their heads.

"Master Xiong!" He called out.

"Oh, oh," Xiong Buyou responded. "Old Eight! You mean, you want *us* to be this 'villain'?!"

Chen Minggang smiled but didn't speak.

"I have to go back and discuss this," Xiong Buyou feigned hesitation. "This is a big matter."

"Isn't grain also a big matter for the Noble Group?" Chen Minggang dropped a hint.

He had calculated this scheme over and over, believing there were no flaws. The key was how to persuade the Australians—he felt it wasn't a big problem. For the Australians to establish themselves here, grain was fundamental. The Australians reclaiming wasteland everywhere showed their thirst for grain. When the Australians first established themselves, they called the leaders of all villages and stockades in the county to levy grain and conscripts, doing some "reasonable burden," which obviously showed a huge demand for grain too. With such an opportunity to get a large amount of grain legitimately, why wouldn't they do it?

"True, true." Xiong Buyou simply played his part to the full, luring him to speak openly, showing hesitation on his face. "It's just that we are people from overseas and know nothing about Great Ming's tax collection..."

"This, gentlemen need not worry about." Chen Minggang felt he had said enough and showed his attitude directly.

"Good. With this word from you, Old Eight, I can give a definite report." Xiong Buyou cupped his hands to take his leave.

Chen Minggang respectfully saw him out. Watching him go far, he returned to the private room. Just as he wanted to order a snack to alleviate hunger and calculate properly, suddenly his apprentice, named Zhou Qi, rushed in hurriedly. First, he shouted: "Master! Trouble!"

"What trouble?" Chen Minggang asked hurriedly seeing his hurried steps.

"Mistress, Mistress—" Zhou Qi stammered.

"What about Mistress?" Chen Minggang really disliked his shrewish wife, née Zhang. Zhang's shrewishness was famous in the county town. His family lived on the back street of the county yamen, and neighbors were almost all clerks and runners serving in the county. When it came to being treacherous and tricky, few in ancient society could compare to yamen clerks, but even this group shook their heads at the mention of Chen Minggang's wife.

Chen Minggang was also a resounding figure in the county whose word was law, but he was helpless against this wife. His father-in-law was the former clerk of the Punishment Section in Lingao County Yamen. His elder brother-in-law was now a clerk in the Punishment Section, and his younger brother-in-law was a runner in the Fast Squad. They were all birds of a feather. This was a network of human relations woven over generations; even if he didn't like it, he had no choice.

"Mistress just went to fight at Qiuhong's place!"

"Ah?!" Chen Minggang stood up. Qiuhong was a prostitute who came from the mainland a few years ago. She set up a private brothel in the county town to receive guests. After he took a fancy to her, she became his exclusive mistress. Chen Minggang was very infatuated with this outsider woman who was very different from local women. Because he worried about his wife making a scene, he didn't dare hide her in the county town. Instead, he built a house about a *li* outside the city to settle her, bought several bondmaids for her use, and specially arranged people to keep watch around the house—first to prevent his wife from making trouble, and second to guard against libertines seducing Qiuhong and giving him a green hat to wear.
