# Chapter 558 - Female Servant School

After purification was complete, the Health Department took the lead in conducting comprehensive physical examinations, confirming the presence of any malignant diseases and various chronic conditions—especially the latter. Shi Niaoren personally took command, directing Zhang Ziyi and her nurses in conducting the physicals.

The examination covered all areas within the transmigrator health department's capabilities. Shi Niaoren required thoroughness and detail, including inquiries about family medical history. Based on his observations of immigrants, Shi Niaoren had summarized the common hereditary diseases of the people in this timeline. The purpose of "life secretaries" was obvious to everyone. Considering they would likely bear the transmigrators' first generation of offspring, the health of future generations couldn't be taken lightly.

Anyone found to have hidden ailments, chronic diseases, or a family medical history was eliminated. Those needing treatment were isolated for treatment. Those with conditions that didn't interfere with work or weren't contagious were arranged elsewhere: educated ones could later be recommended for administrative training classes; uneducated ones would be assigned to the General Affairs Office to work as attendants in various facilities specifically serving transmigrators.

About forty-some people were eliminated this way. Those who qualified entered a newly built specialized camp to receive the next stage of training. To distinguish them from other natives and provide a respectable title, the Female Servant Countermeasures Committee issued the official standard designation "Life Secretary."

Training life secretaries was personally overseen by Chairman Wen. It was treated as a special priority; anything it involved got a green light. Ma Qianzhu had many complaints about this—in his view, it was a serious waste of the transmigrator collective's human and material resources. But the mantle of "the masses' interests" made it difficult for him to say much.

Unlike other camps managed by the Civil Affairs Committee, the Female Servant School was directly managed and supplied by the General Affairs Office. It had real walls rather than simple wire fencing or bamboo enclosures. There was only one entrance, and on ordinary days security was strict—without a special pass, no one was allowed into the school.

Though small, the school was complete in all aspects: it had a separate bathhouse, kitchen, and cafeteria, plus an indoor gymnasium for exercise even on rainy days. There was also a small clinic. The Health Department specially assigned two native nurses to serve the students here.

The dormitory standards were even better than Fragrant Meadow Education Park—here it was four to a room, each room equipped with a full-length mirror. This was considered ultra-luxurious in native eyes.

Once the female servants entered here, they completely lost their personal freedom. The indenture contracts they signed were "absolute contracts"—not only did they lack the right to automatically gain freedom after seven years, but even the right to be ransomed was stripped away. Even if their parents or relatives became wealthy and wanted to ransom them, they could only do so with the master's grace. Chairman Wen didn't intend to use this to force female servants to serve transmigrators for life—he merely planned to reserve this "grace" for transmigrators to use for winning hearts in the future.

In the school, they were subjected to the strictest discipline. They weren't allowed to contact the outside world; there were rules for walking, speaking, eating, and even sleeping. Women selected from among the settlers who had served as housekeepers or maids in wealthy households were put in charge of their direct supervision.

All native personnel serving the school were women over thirty-five, required to be healthy, hardworking, capable, and strict in attitude. They had to have family in Lingao, and educational level didn't matter. The final requirement was that they be taciturn and guaranteed not to gossip outside.

These women were very willing to strictly enforce the school's discipline, showing no mercy. Cries and screams from the female servants could often be heard from within the walled compound.

This technique was called "instilling fear"—colloquially known as giving them a show of force. Unlike the disciplined superior-subordinate relationship cultivated among trainees and soldiers, here there was no promotion of any spirit of self-reliance. The core was "gratitude" and "fear."

This approach was considered unnecessary by quite a few committee members, and some even suspected Chairman Wen had SM tendencies. But Chairman Wen, with far-sighted vision, declared it "a matter of stability and unity for the transmigrator collective's future."

"Men come in all varieties," Chairman Wen said at a Female Servant Countermeasures Committee meeting. "Some are very manly, but some comrades are too effeminate! If we don't properly discipline the female servants, making them feel the deepest fear from the bottom of their hearts, Wu Zetian-style figures might emerge in some transmigrators' households!"

The committee members burst into laughter—everyone found it inconceivable.

"What are you laughing at? The timeline we came from was an overly effeminate world. Do you really think you're all that manly?" Chairman Wen gave a very manly wave of his hand. "As I see it, every one of you looks like wife-fearing material!"

Everyone laughed even harder.

"Hmph, who dares say they never bought flowers on Valentine's Day? Never treated a woman to dinner?"

"Chairman Wen, that's not quite the same thing..."

"A real man doesn't need all these frivolous gestures!" Chairman Wen said painfully. "Modern-era men have all been brainwashed by feminists, their IQs reduced by Korean dramas. They've made women into angels, and not just that—into mistresses, goddesses."

An Xi said: "Chairman Wen makes a good point. There are many historical examples of men being manipulated by women. Otherwise we wouldn't have the saying 'even heroes can't resist a beauty's charms.'"

"Comrade Xiao An shows insight." Chairman Wen praised An Xi. "But back to business! The possibility of being manipulated by women exists. We must nip it in the bud from the source now!"

"But will female transmigrators have objections? The current 'show of force' education method seems to carry a suspicion of abusing women."

"Anyone with objections can raise them—we'll vote democratically," Wen Desi said. "Everyone has freedom of speech."

"I don't think there will be," Ma Jia said. "Having someone give those 'little vixens' a good thrashing—isn't that a good thing?"

Besides this batch of women, the Female Servant School also needed a principal to handle all affairs. The otaku who had enthusiastically expressed on BBS their willingness to educate female servants for everyone were obviously unreliable—they might well dip into the goods themselves. It would be safer and more reliable to find a woman to take charge.

Among the transmigrators, there were nearly twenty adult women. The problem was that except for Li Xiaolü and Du Wen, who were single, all were transmigrators' wives or girlfriends—clearly they had no interest in cultivating their future competitors. As for Li and Du, one was a detached free spirit who wouldn't say a word beyond work requirements; the other was an absolute feminist who found this even more detestable.

After much thought, they settled on Dong Weiwei. Not because she had shown any "magnanimous" spirit, but because Dong Weiwei was the female servants' fitness instructor.

This job had originally been Chen Sigen's—as a professional fitness instructor, he was familiar with women's body-sculpting courses, even quite knowledgeable about some. This wasn't unusual in fitness clubs; in some clubs, male instructors even taught belly dancing.

But Chen Sigen had concerns. After all, what was being trained here were transmigrators' future concubines. As a tall, handsome, muscular man, fitness instructors easily had romantic encounters. Even if nothing actually happened, he couldn't afford to have rumors spread about him.

So Chen Sigen found Dong Weiwei, planning to use an indirect teaching method: first teach Dong Weiwei, who would then teach the female servants.

Dong Weiwei's specialty was bodybuilding, and she was familiar with various body-sculpting training methods. For interest, she had also haphazardly learned many trendy things—she had studied belly dancing and pole dancing too. With Chen Sigen's guidance and instruction, she became an indispensable fitness instructor for the Female Servant School.

Wen Desi figured that since Dong Weiwei was willing to be an instructor, her resistance to the Female Servant School wasn't strong, so she could be entrusted with this important responsibility.

After a special meeting with her, Dong Weiwei was somewhat hesitant about this appointment—not because of any feminist concerns, but because she still had a pile of work at the Social Work Department to handle. Her collaboration with Du Wen, while not seamlessly close, was still pleasant. Seeing the rural grassroots organizations gradually taking shape under her hands brought a sense of accomplishment that was hard to express in words.

"You can hold both positions—you're already teaching at the school anyway," Wen Desi said, knowing she didn't want to give up her position in the Civil Affairs Committee. "Just come to the school on teaching days to inspect and handle some administrative matters."

"Who will be in charge on regular days then? If I'm doing this, I definitely have to do it well."

"You don't need to worry about that," Wen Desi said. "A suitable candidate will be arranged."

"Alright, I accept." Dong Weiwei said frankly. "I know the Executive Committee is in a difficult position too—can't trust men, afraid women won't be willing. Rest assured, since I'm doing this, I'll definitely do it well. But I want to participate in selecting the assistant principal."

"Very good!" Chairman Wen nodded with satisfaction. "Very big-picture minded."

"Chairman Wen, you flatter me. This humble woman has shallow knowledge and can only contribute what little she can." In her excitement, Dong Weiwei revealed her Ming fan-girl characteristics.

Actually, Dong Weiwei was quite interested in this appointment. She hoped to cultivate some beautiful women with a mixed Chinese-Western temperament—after all, her university graduation thesis had been *On the Pleasure Culture of Jiangnan during the Tianqi and Chongzhen Reigns*.

When Gao Xiaosong returned from sea and learned of his wife's new position, he joked:

"This school is training concubines for transmigrators. Aren't you afraid you'll create a little vixen who'll take your place?"

"Hmph, I'm the primary wife, wearing the red dress!" Dong Weiwei wasn't concerned about this at all. "Besides, she doesn't even have concubine status—she's just a maid. If she wants to be a concubine, she still needs my approval. If she dares be a vixen, I'll skin her for a coat."

She blinked: "Should we use our female servant subsidy to buy a girl of our own?"

"Of course not. Having you alone at home is enough." Gao Xiaosong immediately declared his refusal with righteous words, demonstrating his firm stance.

"Liar." Dong Weiwei wrapped her arms around her husband's neck, smiling coquettishly. "But I'll think about it."
