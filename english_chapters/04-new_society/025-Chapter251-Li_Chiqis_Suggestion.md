# Chapter 251: Li Chiqi's Suggestion

After the meeting between the transmigrators and Li Huamei concluded, the Foreign Affairs Department of the transmigrator regime issued Li Huamei the first maritime trade license, valid for three years. During this period, Li Huamei’s ship, the *Hangzhou*, was permitted to enter Bopu Port freely. The transmigrator authorities waived her docking and pilotage fees, and all goods brought in by the *Hangzhou* were exempt from import tariffs. Outbound goods were also exempt from export tariffs, with the exception of items on the "controlled export" list.

According to the agreement, Li Huamei was granted a monopoly on the Lingao-Goa trade route for one year. All import and export trade between the Transmigrator Group and Goa had to be conducted through her ships.

The Transmigrator Group placed restrictions on this clause: the goods Li Huamei brought to Lingao had to include specific supplies designated by the transmigrators, transported in accordance with their requirements. The prices for these designated supplies would be set by the Transmigrator Group, and their volume was capped at no more than one-fifth of the ship’s cargo capacity. Unless, of course, Li Huamei voluntarily chose to carry more.

She was permitted to repair her ships at Bopu and replenish various supplies needed for navigation. The Transmigrator Group would supply her with food, gunpowder, cannons, and necessary ship repair materials at set prices. She also had the right to lease houses in Bopu long-term for her sailors and any persons she approved of. The number of occupants in her leased housing was limited to a maximum of twelve.

In addition to the obligation of carrying designated goods, Li Huamei promised to train sailors for the Transmigrator Navy in Lingao every year while waiting for the monsoon season to pass, for a period of three years. During the training period, rent for her and all her subordinates in Bopu would be waived.

If necessary, Li Huamei was required to undertake tasks designated by the transmigrators, for which she would be paid according to the nature of the task. These tasks would only be performed while she waited for the monsoon and would not include any military hostilities. If she encountered danger while performing a task, she had the right to jettison the transmigrators' cargo for safety. If she voluntarily participated in a conflict or if her ship was damaged during a task, the Transmigrator Group would compensate her.

These complex clauses were all drafted under Ma Jia's guidance, allowing him to put his learning to practical use. Although he hadn't become the President of the Maritime Court, he had become the Customs Director. His jurisdiction was naturally limited to Bopu, and there wasn't much work to do, since the only person who had actually signed a trade agreement was Li Huamei. Both Gao Ju in Guangzhou and Huang Shunlong in Macau were sedentary merchants—they managed sales but not shipping.

Li Huamei readily agreed to all the conditions; overall, they were quite favorable to her. The monopoly on the Lingao-Goa trade was particularly attractive. As Li Siya had predicted, the Australians were eager to achieve a breakthrough in foreign relations and offered enticing terms.

As for mirrors and glassware, Li Huamei didn't place too much weight on them. These things existed in Goa, too, and the market there was much smaller than in the Ming Empire; one couldn't get rich relying on them. But she was moved by something else she saw.

Snow-white sugar.

The white sugar trade—this was the most profitable business on the international shipping lanes. Li Huamei knew that as long as she could transport this white sugar to Goa, she would make a profit on every shipment—it was a guaranteed win. What’s more, the samples they produced were far superior in whiteness to ordinary products; they would be hot commodities in Goa.

Not long after signing the agreement, she received her first task: to captain the *Hangzhou* and accompany the fleet on a round-island survey.

The fleet consisted of the *Zhenhai* and the *Hangzhou*. The *Hangzhou* was brought along to make up for insufficient transport capacity. The transmigrators calculated that they would be collecting various urgently needed industrial and agricultural materials along the way, so having an extra ship was always good.

To ensure the reliability of the *Hangzhou*, the transmigrators sent a marine detachment aboard under the pretext of protecting the ship's safety. Li Huamei accepted this. In addition to her old acquaintance Li Haiping, the detachment was led by former Coast Guard instructor Gao Xiaosong. He was selected because he was a married soldier, unlike the *otaku* who were easily deceived by women with ulterior motives. The marine detachment was a mixed unit of four Special Reconnaissance Team (SRT) transmigrators and two squads of marines. With a ratio of 24 to 11, this advantage was enough to guard against any situation.

Unexpectedly, this careful deployment came to naught. Li Huamei voluntarily requested to sail on the *Zhenhai*, citing that she could help steer and teach everyone navigation. As for her *Hangzhou*, her first mate could captain it. The Executive Committee appeared somewhat petty in contrast—Li Huamei’s request was undoubtedly a move to dispel any suspicion she felt they had of her. People began to whisper in private that Wen Desi was narrow-minded, and some even hinted that because he had been kidnapped by local women in the past, he might have some psychological trauma leading to a rejection of such women.

The Executive Committee naturally ignored these rumors. However, since Li Huamei was willing to board the *Zhenhai*, she had to be received properly. She was given a separate room in the aft superstructure, and Chuyu was specially transferred from Wu De's side to serve her aboard the ship—with the dual purpose of taking care of her daily needs and monitoring her.

The General Commander of the long-distance survey was Wang Luobin. The reason was his diverse learning and broad knowledge: he came from a farming background, understood industry well, was a close comrade of President Wen, and was low-key and friendly. Consequently, the response to Engineer Wang was positive from all sides. Actually, Wu De and Xi Yazhou were also suitable candidates, but the former was tied down by heavy civil affairs duties, and the latter, acting as the internal BBS administrator, had reportedly deleted many posts by transmigrators recently, causing significant public grievances.

As for the *Zhenhai* itself, the personnel aboard were extremely complex. Lin Chuanqing was appointed captain of the *Zhenhai*, an appointment he accepted with great pleasure. Compared to the former *Deng Yingzhou*, this ship was more than twice as large. Driving it gave him a much greater sense of accomplishment. The sailors were selected from the Navy. The *Zhenhai* itself only required 10 sailors to operate, but for safety, the crew was set at 16. There were also 6 naval cadets from the Military and Political Training Class of the National School—they were aboard as interns, undertaking the first long-distance voyage of their naval careers.

Personnel from various departments—military, foreign affairs, trade, resources, industry and energy—were drafted onto this ship, along with some interns, mainly students specializing in biology and exploration. In the end, there were over 80 crew members on the *Zhenhai*, of which one-third were transmigrators. Many were experts in various fields, bringing with them a lot of specialized equipment and gear.

To maximize protection against accidents, every transmigrator was assigned a survival kit, including an inflatable life vest, a whistle, and emergency survival supplies. Each person was also issued a Glock pistol. Although they weren't going to war, they were fully equipped.

The *Zhenhai* carried a fixed radio station to maintain contact with the base, and the *Hangzhou* also had a radio temporarily installed to ensure communication between the two ships.

Just as everyone was bustling with intense preparations, a dark, fat man with small eyes, curly hair, and muscular build, dressed in camouflage fatigues, arrived at the Executive Committee building. After signing in, he was granted an audience with Wen Desi.

"What's the matter?"

"President Wen, I'm here to talk about the *Zhenhai*."

"Why isn't there a steam engine installed on the *Zhenhai*?" Li Chiqi went straight to the point.

"Oh? Why should we install a steam engine?" Wen Desi found it strange; Li Chiqi was the head of the Vehicle Workshop, which had nothing to do with navigation.

"It matters a lot!" Li Chiqi was somewhat agitated. "President Wen, haven't you considered what to do if the *Zhenhai* encounters enemies once it puts to sea?"

"We have cannons, just fight. Are our rifled guns inferior to the enemy's smoothbores?" Wen Desi knew that the artillery on the *Zhenhai* included not only solid armor-piercing shots but also high-explosive shells. No ship in the East Asian seas of this timeline could withstand its bombardment.

"That's true for ship-to-ship duels. But if we run into an enemy fleet out there, it'll be too late for regrets," Li Chiqi said anxiously. "The *Zhenhai* only has two guns. If we run into four or five enemy ships, crewed by veteran sailors, we won't be able to run away—after all, our sailing skills are poor. If several ships seize the weather gauge and take turns closing in to bombard us... our guns shoot far, but they aren't accurate. Even if we hit and take out one or two, once they swarm us, we're dead all the same! We won't even have a chance to flee."

"And this is our first self-built ship. If something happens, the blow to morale will be immense. And if people die, it's even worse—the lives of transmigrators are paramount!" Li Chiqi continued his earnest remonstration. "If we install a Mozi-I steam engine, whether paddle-wheel or screw-driven, with a 50-horsepower engine, we can easily do over 8 knots without sails. If a fight breaks out, we fight if we have the advantage; if we can't win, we run directly into the wind, and no one will catch us."

"It's too late now. The cargo is loaded, and the personnel are assigned. Adding an engine involves modifying the ship's structure; it's a huge project. A boiler, a steam engine—building them is a minor issue. The key is that once the boiler, steam engine, and coal are on board, the ship's trim will be completely off, and the hull structure will need a major overhaul." He shook his head. "This isn't something that can be finished in a few days. The expedition team leaves the day after tomorrow. To modify it now would mean a delay of at least a month. Time waits for no one."

"But this—"

"Let's discuss it again. You have a point." Although Wen Desi didn't directly accept the proposal, he knew Li Chiqi wasn't wrong. The Executive Committee had indeed overlooked this.

The probability of what Li Chiqi described happening wasn't high, but if they did encounter an enemy fleet, the loss would be catastrophic. This wasn't like the ships going to Guangzhou; with sailors familiar with the sea, there were bays everywhere along the coast to hide in. Even if sunk or captured, the personnel loss would be limited. The *Zhenhai* gathered a large number of transmigrators with specialized technical skills. If the ship were destroyed and people killed, it would be a major blow to the Transmigration Enterprise.

Wen Desi struggled with his thoughts in the office for half an hour, then made a call to the Standing Committee members and the Industry and Energy Committee.

"Come to the office; there's something to discuss."
