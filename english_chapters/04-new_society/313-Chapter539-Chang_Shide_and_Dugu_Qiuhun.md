# Chapter 539 - Chang Shide and Dugu Qiuhun

Originally, the charges prepared against Chang Shide were severe. Shan Liang and others argued that Chang Shide's conduct amounted to "embezzlement of public funds." But this proposal was voted down at the Senate Standing Committee session. The majority—including Executive Committee members—disagreed with that characterization. A faction, represented by Ji Tuisi, held that Chang Shide's conduct was not even illegal. When the Executive Committee had dispatched him to Leizhou, it placed no restrictions on how funds were to be used. Under that premise, so long as he completed his mission, how he spent public money was his own affair. At most, one could say the Executive Committee's authorization was faulty.

Some even questioned whether Shan Liang and company's motives were driven by "jealousy." Chang Shide and his colleagues in Leizhou had risked life and limb, seized Leizhou's sugar resources, opened trade with Vietnam, secured a stable revenue and grain source for the transmigrated collective, and located the Hongji coal deposits. Given such achievements, spending a few dozen taels of public money to buy a few women for his own enjoyment was hardly excessive. Fixating on this issue would only dishearten overseas personnel.

Shan Liang and his allies insisted on "separating merit from fault—rewarding achievement and punishing error"—and on "nipping corruption in the bud." Yet at several Standing Committee meetings, fewer and fewer rallied to his side; some even proposed dropping the inquiry into Chang Shide altogether. The new Executive Committee also showed obvious disinterest. Left with no choice, Shan Liang ultimately submitted a motion to question Chang Shide on "misappropriation of funds."

Ji Xin thought: given the current state of affairs, Chang Shide's acquittal was inevitable. Setting everything else aside, the amount in question was absurdly low—a mere ten taels of silver. Even under Great Ming law, that would not qualify as a crime.

Before the hearing, Ji Xin, following Ma Jia's instructions, had circulated background materials on the Chang Shide case to the Senators serving as jurors. The materials covered the Leizhou Station's operating conditions, personnel files on the five slave girls, and their current work assignments. Circulating background materials was proper procedure—but the thorough data and ample facts demonstrating the Leizhou Station's immense contributions could not fail to leave a deep impression on the Senators.

Everyone understood that merit and fault could not simply cancel each other out. Great achievements did not erase minor faults. Yet, seeing such enormous accomplishments, the Senators would naturally realize that Chang Shide had not gained all this without effort.

Sure enough, when Mu Quan read out the bill of inquiry, some Senators already looked impatient. When he reached "…willfully misappropriating public funds totaling a staggering ten taels of silver," someone actually laughed out loud.

After the reading concluded, Ma Jia asked whether Chang Shide had anything to say.

Chang Shide rose calmly. "I wish to make a statement."

"Permission granted." Ma Jia tapped his gavel.

Chang Shide's statement was simple. First, he admitted that purchasing the women did include an element of personal gratification. But the women did not serve him alone. After purchase, these five women also handled a great deal of the Leizhou Station's daily housekeeping—work that would have required personnel anyway. In other words, the women were necessary assets for the Leizhou Station; his extraction of sexual services was merely incidental "added value."

"These slave girls primarily serve the transmigrated collective; serving me personally is secondary." Chang Shide enumerated A'Xiu and the others' outstanding performance at the Leizhou Station. "At our most critical hour, when several thousand rioters outside could have burst in at any moment to smash the machinery, burn down the sugar refinery, and chop us all to pieces—when indigenous employees inside the refinery were wavering and many wanted to flee—only these slave girls displayed the most unwavering resolve, vowing to follow the transmigrated collective in life and death. Why was that? Has no one considered?"

The Senators' faces showed incomprehension. Chang Shide raised his voice by eight degrees: "Precisely because I had bedded—er, taken them in!"

The audience burst into laughter.

Chang Shide continued solemnly: "The facts prove that trust built on physical relations is the most solid of all master-servant relationships in this timeline. Slave girls regard being taken in by their master as the greatest expression of trust and favor; thereafter, they follow their master with all their heart. Perhaps this point has escaped everyone's consideration, but we should adapt to local customs and find a path toward harmony between the indigenous population and transmigrators."

One Senator shouted: "So you also opened the chrysanthemum of the Wen brothers? The materials say they're also unswerving loyal!" The room roared again with laughter.

Chang Shide did not bat an eye. "I have no such predilection. If any of you do, feel free to try it."

Ma Jia had to remind everyone: questions must be preceded by raising one's hand; no shouting out.

Chang Shide then rambled on at length, some of it bordering on absurdity, sending the Senators into repeated fits of laughter. The atmosphere grew quite jovial. Shan Liang was secretly anxious: with this combination of crooked logic and showmanship, Chang Shide was winning over all the goodwill. But Ma Jia's rules forbade interrupting a speaker, so he could only fret in silence.

Finally, Chang Shide declared: since everyone felt his use of slave girls smacked of misusing public property, he was willing to personally purchase all the girls he had taken in. "After purchase, these slave girls will continue to serve the transmigrated collective's great cause at the Leizhou Station, not merely provide service to me personally—though, of course, certain services can only be provided to me; I regret they cannot serve the public." The Senators laughed again.

"This, too, is a small contribution to the transmigrated collective. I have finished. Thank you all." Chang Shide returned to his seat.

Though Shan Liang and others subsequently challenged and refuted his statement, insisting that no amount of merit could shield lawbreaking and demanding severe punishment, Chang Shide offered no further defense. Having amply demonstrated his verbal prowess, he humbly declared that he would unconditionally accept the Senators' verdict and would not defend himself further.

Ji Xin watched with mounting amazement. This rough-looking fellow Chang Shide had more twists and turns in his belly than anyone guessed. The procedural maneuvers Ji Xin had prepared proved unnecessary.

Ma Jia, seeing that both sides had finished, called for a vote on whether Chang Shide was guilty of misappropriating funds.

The twenty-five Senators cast secret ballots. The vote was opened on the spot: 19 to 6, declaring Chang Shide not guilty. Ma Jia then announced that the charge of misappropriating funds against Chang Shide was not sustained.

However, his use of public property for private purposes did exist. Therefore, Ma Jia ruled that Chang Shide must, within fifteen days, pay the full purchase price of four slave girls—two taels apiece for a total of eight taels of silver—converted into circulation coupons and deposited into the Treasury account at the Delon Grain House. Ordinarily, he should have paid for five, but because this "maid benefit" applied to Chang Shide as well, one was deducted.

Chang Shide declared on the spot that he unconditionally accepted this verdict. Ma Jia then announced the conclusion of Chang Shide's hearing. After a thirty-minute recess, the Dugu Qiuhun case would be heard. Chang Shide thanked everyone present and shook hands with those who had accompanied him and offered congratulations. Ma Jia thought: his bearing and demeanor right now were straight out of a classic scene in some American film.

During the recess, Ji Xin stepped outside and lit a cigarette. He saw Ma Jia also outside the screening room, drinking water.

"That Chang Shide sure can talk! He turned everyone around in one go," Ji Xin said.

Ma Jia smiled mysteriously. "Eloquence certainly matters—but isn't such a positive response a bit over the top?"

Ji Xin thought: the outcome was undoubtedly linked to the active lobbying by the Guangzhou and Leizhou Stations. He murmured with some concern: "Though the Chang Shide affair was admittedly a bit of a tempest in a teapot, this influence of interest groups…"

Ma Jia nodded. "There is indeed such a tendency. But as you know, it's unavoidable." He poured the water from his cup at the foot of a tree. "Only balance is the key."

Ji Xin was a bit puzzled about how this "balance" would be achieved, but seeing Ma Jia's confident demeanor—and recalling the tactics he had used in his rise—he supposed the head of the Law-Studies Club had his methods.

Then came the hearing of the Dugu Qiuhun case. The questioning of Dugu Qiuhun was far less courteous. The charges against him were extremely severe. Initially, he was to be charged with "rebellion," but this proposal met fierce opposition from both the police system and the Army. Many Senators also felt that, although Dugu Qiuhun had committed a serious organizational error, calling him a traitor smacked of trumped-up charges.

In the end, the charges were: "unauthorized mobilization of armed forces without authorization," "intent to inflict bodily harm on transmigrators," and "intent to destroy public property." The last charge derived from his attempt to seize the Telecom Building.

After Ji Xin read out the bill of inquiry, Dugu Qiuhun was given the floor to respond.

Dugu Qiuhun stated that he had mobilized the police to enter Bairen Fortress "to maintain order and prevent the situation from escalating."

"In addition to being East Gate Market Precinct Chief, I am also Bairen Fortress Outer-Perimeter Security Commander. I have authority to handle all manner of emergencies inside and outside the Fortress. When there is a protest march in the city, I naturally have both the duty and the right to enter and maintain order—to prevent acts of vandalism, looting, or arson such as occur in other timelines. Therefore, I cannot accept the charge of unauthorized mobilization of armed forces."

Shan Liang then challenged him: "On what basis did you presume the demonstrators would commit vandalism and looting? Isn't that a kind of 'presumption of guilt' on your own authority? Do you have so little faith in transmigrators' political awareness?"

Dugu Qiuhun shot back: "Every protest march in the world requires approval and police escort. What makes you think transmigrators' awareness is higher than everyone else's?"
