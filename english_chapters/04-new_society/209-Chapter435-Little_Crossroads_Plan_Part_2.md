# Chapter 435 Little Crossroads Plan (Part 2)

The Executive Committee's decision was to focus on the eastern section of the east-west road, specifically the Gaoshan Ridge—the Piye Mountain area. First, the road from the county town to Damei Village would be completed. In the plan, the Piye Mountain area would serve as the Crossing Group's main livestock-raising base in the future. Taking advantage of the relatively cooler mountain climate, they would open pastures there to raise horses, goats, cattle, donkeys, mules, and other livestock. At the same time, they would develop mountain economic crop cultivation.

Simultaneously, they would build the key project "Grand Library" and various research facilities in the core area of Piye Mountain, storing the Crossing Group's various materials and books there.

As for the area west of the Wenlan River, besides the riverside plains, the most valuable should be the Macao area. As a salt-producing region, salt export port, and future salt chemical industry base, the Bopu-Macao road seemed more important. However, since the salt from Macao Peninsula was currently transported in large quantities by sea ship at low transport costs, Shan Daoqian believed there was no need to open this road for now.

"However, if we're going to open it, we can do something that kills two birds with one stone," Shan Daoqian reported to the Executive Committee. "It might be beneficial for Xiong Buyou's work."

Shan Daoqian's idea was very simple: repair the post roads—the official roads.

Lingao's official roads were basically coastal. One started from the county's East Gate, passing through Guanrong Post-Chaoyang Post-Changchuan Post-Jiasui Post, then entering Chengmai County territory. This was the route to the prefectural capital. The other started from the West Gate, passing through Xinxing Post-Huaiyin Post-Luoxian Post toward Danzhou.

These two were Lingao's main east-west arterial roads, but few people traveled these post roads. Especially the road to Danzhou—in the Ming dynasty, there was hardly any material exchange between Lingao and Danzhou. The only bulk cargo transport was the military provisions Lingao allocated to Danzhou. Every year, over two thousand *shi* of grain from the autumn tax had to be transported to Danzhou. For safety's sake, they always went by land. As for the road to the prefectural capital, more people traveled it. But since road conditions along the way were poor, most people still chose to go by sea.

Shan Daoqian had conducted field surveys of these two official roads. The road conditions were terrible—so poor they could only be rated as ungraded roads. The width at the narrowest point was only two meters; at the widest, under four meters. They were just the most ordinary dirt roads. Not only were there no facilities like drainage or roadbeds, but some sections had literally sunk into the ground, becoming trench-like roads averaging one meter below ground level, with some spots as low as four meters. When it rained, the road even became a stream. Without local guides, Shan Daoqian couldn't even identify traces of the official road in many sections.

Shan Daoqian wasn't surprised by this—when he had studied road construction, he had learned some history of Chinese roads and knew that ancient roads often had this sunken condition. As the saying went, "A major road traveled for many years becomes a river." With no roadbed or drainage, over time these dirt roads naturally became "road ditches."

This road was ancient even by Ming dynasty standards. It had been built during the Shaoxing period of the Song dynasty. Since then, there had been only patching and repairs, no substantial changes—no wonder someone once said that change in ancient life was extremely slow.

As for the environment along the road, it could only be described as desolate. The first few stations after leaving the county's West Gate were still areas with many villages and concentrated population. But after passing Jiasui Post, the last ten-plus *li* to Chengmai was completely wilderness on both sides of the road, with hardly any signs of habitation or farmland. However, the bridges along the route were still maintained. The posts along the road still had impoverished post soldiers stationed who scraped by on meager money and grain, responsible for transmitting documents, maintaining supplies for official travelers, and road maintenance.

"Repairing the official road is naturally good for pleasing Wu Mingjin, but it doesn't benefit us much," Wen Desi looked at the route map. "There's nothing worth developing along the way."

"It can make travel easier for villages along the route and attract them to the East Gate Market. It can also attract people from neighboring Chengmai and Danzhou to Lingao."

"But this involves the post stations along the way. This needs to be negotiated with the county yamen." Wen Desi looked at the map. "I don't think we need to repair it all. Just repair part of it—from the county's West Gate to Chaoyang Post." Chaoyang Post, on modern Lingao maps, belonged to Bobei Town and was very close to Macao. Repairing this section would also be useful later when building the road to Macao.

"Wu Mingjin would certainly be happy. The condition of the county's post road traffic is also a criterion for his performance evaluation."

"As for other sections," said Xi Yazhou, who was responsible for evaluating the military significance of road projects, "I think poor road conditions are actually fine. If we repair them too well and the Ming army comes to attack us by land, they'll move too fast."

Shan Daoqian's Transportation Bureau was tasked with comprehensively hardening the existing roads. He immediately encountered a problem: insufficient hardening materials.

The hardening materials the Crossing Group used for road construction were mainly coal slag and steel slag. Recently, after it was discovered that steel slag could be used to make phosphate fertilizer, it was taken over by the agricultural department. All Shan Daoqian had left was coal slag. In fact, even with steel slag, it was a drop in the bucket for this massive plan.

Not only were hardening materials insufficient, but the road surfaces already hardened with coal slag had revealed the problem of inadequate load-bearing capacity. The heavy ox-carts with hardwood wheels caused significant damage to the road surface.

"We need to build the roadbed with crushed stone. With just this compacted dirt roadbed, as more vehicles travel on it, damage will only accelerate."

"We need maintenance. I want to set up a maintenance team with section-by-section maintenance. Use without repair, and any road will break down." Shan Daoqian said this after surveying the road that had been pitted by ox-carts with Meilin from the Construction Company.

"Crushed stone road? You might as well ask for asphalt road," Meilin was skeptical. A crushed stone road would certainly be better than a dirt road with a layer of coal slag, but where would they find so much crushed stone?

Stone, they had plenty of. Since opening Nanbao Town, the supply of general construction stone materials for the Crossing Group mainly came from the Nanbao area. The original Bairen Rapids quarry now mainly produced high-grade building stone. The Nanbao Mining Office mainly used blasting to mine stone on a large scale, but filling roadbeds mainly required crushed gravel. The stone had to be processed and broken up.

"Do you know how much crushed gravel we need to harden these road surfaces?" Meilin said to Shan Daoqian. "If we rely on sending women to break stones by hand like now, comprehensive road hardening will take until the Year of the Monkey."

"Of course, we can't continue with manual labor. Mass movements can save the day temporarily but not forever. I was thinking of asking the ore processing plant for help." Shan Daoqian plopped down on a milestone. "The ore processing plant has two crushers. They're more than enough for breaking stone."

"Those machines are very busy now. The cement plant, fuel plant, and ceramics plant all need them... They're crushing day and night. Taking on road construction stone materials too might be too much—and there's no iron ore yet. Once iron ore comes in, it'll be even worse."

"It would be best if we could have one of our own," Shan Daoqian thought. "How about applying to the Planning Commission to have the machine factory build one? Put it at the Nanbao quarry and process the crushed stone directly before shipping it out."

"I doubt it. Have you seen a crusher?"

"Very simple machinery. Just make the simplest single-toggle jaw crusher. What's difficult about that?"

This type of jaw crusher's main component was an eccentric wheel driving a group of connecting rods, which then pushed a movable jaw plate to crush stone, thereby breaking large rocks into small ones. The structure was simple enough for a primary school student to understand, and it worked reliably, requiring almost no maintenance. Although invented in 1858, it was used in cement, ceramics, mining, metallurgy, and other industries until the latter half of the 20th century.

"That's a steel tiger with a mouthful of steel teeth. Very material-intensive."

Though this type of crusher had various advantages, it was crude and bulky, basically piled up from steel. Just one movable jaw plate required over a ton of steel. Whether this major steel consumer could get manufacturing approval from the Planning Commission was a question.

Unexpectedly, Ma Qianzhu readily approved it. With more and more infrastructure construction and increasing demand for building materials, crushers were needed for cement, lime, and crushed stone alike. The Nanbao Mining Office had also mentioned to the Planning Commission that it would be best to build an ore processing plant locally to sort and crush the various ores mined on-site, saving transport capacity.

Ma Qianzhu not only approved the crusher but also added more—once manufacturing succeeded, three more would be built. All four machines would be used at the Nanbao Ore Processing Plant. Additionally, one Mozi Model 1 steam engine would be allocated to power the equipment.

The machine factory, which had just finished equipping the forging shop, heard about this major project and was immediately energized. Most people in machinery had a kind of "gigantism fetish"—the bigger, the better. When talking about things like hydraulic presses and forging machines, they spoke as if discussing some AV actress with a pretty face, nice figure, and seductive voice.

The crusher's main component was the jaw plate, which could be made of low-carbon steel. Through casting cannons, steam engine cylinders, and other large equipment, the metallurgy department now had considerable experience with large castings. The several apprentices Xiao Bailang had trained could now help manufacture molds for large castings. This jaw plate weighed about one ton, far from the heaviest casting they had made.

Soon, the foundry poured the required steel billet. This one-ton steel billet was loaded onto a sixteen-wheeled heavy-duty rail car and hauled from the foundry all the way to the machine factory's forging shop.

Currently, this jaw plate ingot was still in as-cast structure, with relatively large columnar crystals and a loose center. Mechanical strength was limited. Therefore, it had to undergo major plastic deformation through forging and heat treatment to break up the columnar crystals into fine grains, compact the loose structure, and obtain excellent metal structure and mechanical properties.
