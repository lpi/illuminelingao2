# Chapter 393 - Winning Over Defectors

Besides revising legal provisions, just transcribing legal documents was a massive undertaking—ordinary people couldn't handle it. The "unofficial establishment" folks had to be mobilized.

"No problem! Majia, you're so accommodating—we brothers will definitely help!" Several people immediately agreed.

"But we have day shifts, so we'd have to work evenings."

"I'll talk to Wu De about 'borrowing' you for a few days."

Wu De supported establishing a judicial system; he shouldn't refuse such a loan. Without the loan formality, these people would work as volunteers, and only outside work hours.

Escaping boring work for a few days to do their specialty pleased everyone.

Majia took a big swig of kvass. The Law Club members seemed in good spirits—a good sign. This was an era of engineer governance; in the future, like America, it would probably be an era of lawyer governance...

After the meeting, Majia submitted a report to Wu De requesting these people be "assigned" to the Maritime Court. He also submitted an application to Xiao Zishan for office expenses—for drinks and cigarettes during work.

Xiao Zishan was quite generous, immediately writing an appropriation slip and also issuing a special-supply purchase certificate allowing extra purchases of "special-supply goods."

Previously, special-supply goods were mainly living consumables not produced in this time-space—various foods: cola, cigarettes, instant noodles, canned goods; also toiletries and medicines like floral water, Tiger Balm, towels, and medicinal drops. These were mainly supplied to transmigrators doing "heavy labor" or "dangerous work"; sometimes awarded as prizes to commended individuals.

As supplies improved and stocks diminished, special-supply items changed. Some items were removed—cigarettes, cola, instant noodles. Others were added. The biggest change was locally-produced industrial products increasing. Actually many items weren't particularly "high-grade"—just capacity-limited. For example, *Fengcheng*'s cold storage produced several types of ice pops. Though ingredients were just fruit, mung beans, red beans, sugar, and filtered water, they were rationed per person—one daily for every transmigrator regardless of age or gender. Children under 13 received an extra one.

Majia checked the special-supply certificate's offerings: "Leizhou Sugar Industry" rum (750ml), one bottle daily limit; Lingao-brand cigarettes, one 10-pack daily limit per person. Just two items, but with meaningful implications.

"Seems quite a few on the Executive Committee think well of us." Majia murmured.

Only he clearly understood why Executive Committee members' attitudes showed such curious differences.

"Almost a year since landing." Majia muttered, pocketing the slip.

While the Law Club folks busied themselves with the five-masted ship piracy case, a visitor arrived at Bo-pu.

This person arrived by small fishing boat. Per current emergency protocols, all vessels reaching Lingao-Xuwen waters required inspection. The visitor claimed during marine boarding inspection to be a rice merchant—the boat was indeed loaded with grain. After landing, he revealed his identity to the naval officer on dock duty: he was Zhu Cailao's envoy—Shi Shisi, the minor pirate captain captured during last year's "fishing" operation.

Back then, Ma Qianzhu had released him for peace talks with Zhu Cailao. But the man had vanished without trace. Afterward, Zhu Cailao rarely operated near Qiongzhou waters. Peace talks were shelved.

Arriving at Bo-pu, Shi Shisi demanded to see "Chief Ma," bringing Zhu Cailao's negotiation demands and a letter.

The letter's tone was hard. Zhu Cailao was willing to negotiate with "Australians," but the Australian collective must compensate all his losses from the Gou family's destruction in Lingao—he wasn't interested in their proposal of exclusive glass export trade rights as compensation. He directly demanded 40,000 Spanish silver dollars as compensation, plus an equal amount as a loan, for which he'd pay 2% monthly interest. Additionally, he specifically requested cannons and gunpowder; if possible, ship-building assistance. These he'd purchase with cash or goods.

Though the letter's tone was arrogant—very much "magnanimous despite wrongs" and "agree or we attack immediately"—after Ma Qianzhu studied it repeatedly, he sensed bluster hiding weakness. Zhu Cailao's urgent tone regarding silver, weapons, and ships clearly revealed desperate need for support.

"If only we had the strength for a maritime Blackwater operation—Zheng Zhilong would have headaches." Chen Haiyang said during the letter review.

"With such strength we'd have destroyed him already, taking his ships and men." Ma Qianzhu held the letter, truly undecided. "Our intelligence is still too scarce." He said painfully.

Besides the Intelligence Committee's scraps from historical records, the transmigrator collective's pirate intelligence mainly came from Guangzhou Station's collection along Guangdong coasts—characterized by hearsay, extremely confused content. Even reports from the exalted Ming Guangdong Governor's and Imperial Censor's offices were equally confused. Major pirate leaders often had several different names; Yu'eshui had compiled a duplicate-name chart to avoid research when new intelligence arrived.

Ma Qianzhu didn't know Zhu Cailao's recent year had been rough. His north-south fleets—the northern fleet operating in Fujian waters—had scattered under combined Ming-Zheng Zhilong suppression. At this critical moment, the mysterious "Australians" had blindsided him—the Gou family was his biggest fence and stash location. This loss was blood-spitting severe; sudden financial strain caused supply crises and severe subordinate unrest. Some people and ships had immediately scattered. Zhu Cailao wanted to attack Lingao for revenge and property recovery, but maritime situations were complex. Liu Xiang's pressure forced him to first handle this suddenly-risen upstart. After failing to seize ships through deception, he led the southern fleet north to Fujian, hoping for profits to rebuild—Fujian waters then had extremely prosperous foreign trade: Japan routes plus trade with Dutch-occupied Tayouan, both highly profitable.

Arriving in Fujian waters, he gathered scattered people and ships, raided several land targets, replenished provisions—Zhu Cailao's strength recovered. But Zheng Zhilong viewed all Fujian maritime trade as his preserve; naturally he didn't welcome Zhu Cailao. Li Kuiqi was even more displeased by his opportunism. Various factions constantly clashed in Fujian waters. Zhu Cailao's weaker finances gradually put him at disadvantage.

In this situation, Zhu Cailao planned retreating to eastern Guangdong, but Liu Xiang, now established in eastern Guangdong waters, didn't want him back. The first returning ships were intercepted at the Fujian-Guangdong border by Liu Xiang's fleet. After a major battle, though inconclusive, Zhu Cailao's passive situation remained unrelieved.

"You've traveled far. Rest first." Ma Qianzhu said pleasantly, then ordered him lodged at the East Gate Market commercial house. His subordinates and boat crew would stay at Bo-pu's sailor hostel.

The Executive Committee immediately convened an emergency meeting to discuss Zhu Cailao's terms. Honestly, they weren't harsh. Spoils from the Gou family definitely exceeded 40,000 Spanish dollars, and his loan request included interest payments.

"Zhu Cailao won't live long." Yu'eshui said. "Negotiating with him now is worthless—unless we intend alliance."

Historically, Zhu Cailao would be defeated by Zheng Zhilong attacking Min'an this August, then annihilated at Nanri.

Clearly the main question for discussion was: should history be changed to save Zhu Cailao's group?

Some supported this—Zhu Cailao's existence could check Zheng Zhilong while indirectly checking Liu Xiang. From the transmigrator collective's perspective, the more chaotic the seas, the better. Their naval strength could protect Guangdong trade and shipping through chaos, but lacked capacity for major fleet battles.

Others thought saving Zhu Cailao unnecessary. First, they couldn't absorb this maritime force yet; second, once allied, they'd probably assume increasing responsibilities—something the collective didn't want.

Wen Desi wasn't interested in alliance. In his view, investment was too large, uneconomical. Saving Zhu Cailao meant providing financial support and selling weapons per his demands. Unfortunately, the transmigrators weren't rich in either. Even with negotiable amounts, it would be substantial. Besides, cannons and gunpowder were urgently needed by the collective itself.

"I believe Zhu Cailao's requested amounts aren't exaggerated—he genuinely needs this much money to operate his fleet. And this is probably just the beginning."

Once invested in this enterprise, it could become a bottomless pit. If Zhu Cailao's situation didn't improve under their support—quite possible; most Executive Committee members weren't arrogant enough to think they could casually alter history—even without his continued appeals, the collective would have to keep expanding bets to salvage investments. Such things often started as "spend a little, accomplish much," then spending grew while results worsened. See how America got trapped in Vietnam.

Times had changed. Ma Qianzhu thought: originally Silobaining's negotiation suggestion was to stabilize Zhu Cailao, making concessions on non-core interests to avoid or delay large-scale retaliation, buying more construction time for Lingao.

Zhu Cailao hadn't played his card during their weakest period—whether transmigrator luck or Liu Xiang's checking—anyway, the most critical period had passed. Negotiating now, his value had diminished. If Yu'eshui's historical data was accurate, Zhu Cailao had less than two months left. What benefit was there in extending his life?

The greatest benefit was merely maintaining one more maritime force to check Liu Xiang and Zheng Zhilong.

But as the Intelligence Committee's historical research deepened, Yu'eshui boldly predicted that for at least three or four years, Fujian-Guangdong maritime chaos would continue. Historically, Zheng Zhilong didn't eliminate Liu Xiang until Chongzhen 8. One more or less Zhu Cailao didn't much affect transmigrators. Perhaps it was better if Zhu Cailao—who'd formally feuded with them—died.

Yu'eshui was now speaking: "...Colleagues, it's now late June 1629 Gregorian. In less than a month, Zhu Cailao will be defeated by Ming forces at Min'an, Fujian, then destroyed by Zheng Zhilong at Nanri. In this final remaining month, how do we plan to influence him?"

"Tell him not to attack Min'an, and when fleeing, avoid Nanri—"

"First, whether he'll heed our advice is unknown; second, we have very limited details about this period. So comprehensive judgments are difficult. If he asks: instead of Min'an, where? Who can produce a strategy benefiting both him and us?"

No one could.

"So we shouldn't try saving him, but act as vultures," Yu'eshui used an ugly but apt metaphor. "...gaining maximum practical benefits from his corpse after his destruction."

Practical benefits meant not treasure, but Zhu Cailao group's personnel and ships—what Chen Haiyang had always wanted.

The task of winning over Zhu Cailao's subordinates fell to the Political Security Bureau's Enemy Work Department, officially named "Rong Operation."

Ran Yao summoned his secret weapon in the Political Security Bureau's office.

"Send for the Enemy Work Department Chief."

"Yes, Chief." Teenage messenger Hu Lai clicked his heels Prussian-style, turned, and ran out. Military-Political Academy students serving as administrative trainees at the Political Security Bureau were all deeply-wronged types, basically arriving destitute. Ran Yao's vetting standards were stricter than the Executive Committee's: no relatives permitted; best if they couldn't remember their own surname; best if they couldn't recall their hometown; had suffered greatly; best if transmigrators had saved their lives. Finally, they had to pass tests—any children showing gluttony, hyperactivity, weakness, or talkativeness were eliminated.

Enemy Work Department Chief Lin Baiguang soon entered. He'd been deputy director of a county committee office, with his own approach to officialdom, climbing quite high at a young age. But his ambitions far exceeded being a civil servant in some dusty county town. Ran Yao knew this man was a typical Chinese-style bureaucrat: always smiling, always measured in speech, always commenting only to a point, drinking heartily without ever falling; sometimes treating people better than blood brothers; also capable of instant betrayal.

Ran Yao also knew this person had used all his ship weight allowance for luxury consumables—dozens of cigarette cartons alone—yet he'd never been seen smoking. Every Political Security Bureau meeting Ran Yao convened had one or two packs of Chunghwa cigarettes of unknown origin on the table—presumably his contribution.

Most suspicious was his solar-powered PDA, which he often studied at night, occasionally writing something. No one knew what he wrote. Ran Yao thought it definitely wasn't novels—more likely a diary. Possibly even a black account book.

Once while discussing work with Ma Qianzhu, Ma Qianzhu had inexplicably asked:

"Does anyone in your department keep a diary?"

At the time Ran Yao hadn't understood the Director's meaning, only vaguely saying no. Ma Qianzhu hadn't pursued the topic.

Later, Wen Desi had also strangely commented privately: "Keeping a diary is a good habit. Pay attention to colleagues with this habit."

Ran Yao took a couple months to realize what they meant.

How did they know the Enemy Work Chief had this habit? Obviously, within the Political Security Bureau or Internal Affairs Committee, there were people he didn't know about reporting directly to Executive Committee leadership.

This deduction didn't surprise Ran Yao, experienced in public security work. Such a powerful department couldn't be entirely controlled by one person. Just as he secretly planted "Circle of Ten" in the Army and Navy.

However, Lin Baiguang's work capability was indeed strong, his attitude extremely proactive—practically superhuman. Not only did he quickly learn the difficult Lingao dialect, he'd self-studied Cantonese, Hokkien, and Mandarin. Recently Ran Yao had noticed him repeatedly practicing a strange dialect each morning.

"That's Manchu." He answered inquirers.

Ran Yao thought: this kid's ambitions are impressive—but ambition drives motivation.

Lin Baiguang entered.

"Sit." Ran Yao got straight to the point. "I've just received an Executive Committee assignment. Your Enemy Work Department will handle it."

"Understood. What's the mission?"

Ran Yao briefly conveyed the Executive Committee's intent.

"So, have you considered how to proceed?"

"It's difficult." Lin Baiguang answered seriously. "We have no 'connections' to exploit among pirate groups. To date, our only contact is the Zhang Youfu line—but he only connects to peripheral pirate elements, and we can't currently judge his reliability."
