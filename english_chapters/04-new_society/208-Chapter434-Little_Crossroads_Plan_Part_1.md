# Chapter 434 Little Crossroads Plan (Part 1)

The so-called Gaoshan Ridge was actually a mountain ridge of Piye Mountain, west of Lingao County Town. Piye Mountain had six main peaks, standing on the northern plain of Lingao. The six ridges of Piye Mountain commanded the Beibu Gulf to the northwest and were a natural barrier created by nature. To the southeast, from the commanding heights, one could overlook the villages and fields within a radius of dozens of *li*. It was an important strategic location in Lingao. On the Xixing Ridge of Piye Mountain, a coastal defense battery was established during the Qing dynasty, with artillery that could control the sea areas around Lingao Corner, Xinying Harbor, and Paipu Harbor in Dan County. In 1950, the Nationalist garrison had also set up artillery positions on Xixing Ridge as the key point of Lingao's coastal defense.

After the liberation of Hainan Island, the PLA had also stationed an artillery unit in the Piye Mountain area, with the garrison located on Mopan Ridge, one of the six ridges.

"From Lingao County Town to Gaoshan Ridge—that is, the Piye Mountain area—the modern road distance is only 3-4 kilometers, still in the area relatively close to our main base. The popular base of Damei Village, established after eliminating the Gou Family Manor, is quite good. If we elevate Damei Village to Damei Commune and relocate some immigrants there to strengthen this area's forces, stationing an infantry company there would be quite secure. This way, we would form a barrier to the west. No enemy could directly launch an attack on Bairen Castle." Military People's Commissar He Ming assessed the benefits of opening a branch base in the Piye Mountain area at the Executive Committee meeting.

"But wouldn't this create too many bases for us and disperse our forces?" Wen Desi expressed concern. The army hadn't grown much larger, but the places requiring defense seemed to be increasing. Nanbao and Macao currently relied on militia for self-defense. This kind of militia might be adequate against bandits, but against Ming troops, they would probably scatter immediately.

"It won't," He Ming pointed at the large-scale map of all Lingao hanging on the wall—this map was unique in this space-time for its precision. It was resurveyed and corrected based on map data from the modern space-time.

"So-called defense is not best achieved by clustering troops in one place," He Ming explained. "For effective defense, you must control key points on the periphery."

Controlling the Piye Mountain area would establish a northwestern defense line for Bairen Castle. It would not only block the Ming army's approach from Danzhou but also strengthen the defense of Bopu Harbor by setting up batteries on Xixing Ridge.

"Our current formation is a linear snake array." He Ming's pointer slid along the Wenlan River. "From Bopu to Nanbao, we're stretched out in a line. If someone attacks our flank and cuts our communications line, the entire strategic situation will become very passive..."

"I don't think any army in this space-time is capable of cutting our communications line..."

"I think they can do it. Don't speak too absolutely." He Ming was more prudent. "Has anyone here actually witnessed the combat capabilities of armies in this space-time?"

Apart from fighting pirates, bandits, and local militia, the "New Army" trained by the Crossing Group had not yet truly faced the Ming army, the Eight Banners, or the "roving bandits." Whether Minié rifles plus volley fire tactics could be invincible hadn't been truly tested.

"As long as a few dozen cavalry rush onto our road, kill one person, hijack one ox-cart, the traffic would essentially be disrupted. We would have to prepare escort forces for every transport convoy."

Everyone was very clear about the consequences once this situation occurred. First would be the interruption of raw material supplies. Bairen Castle, this emerging industrial city, depended on the continuous delivery of industrial raw materials from Bopu and Nanbao to maintain production. Second, the farms developed along the Wenlan River would suffer tremendous damage. Crops, unlike factories, couldn't be defended with cannons and walls.

"What we need to defend now is 'area,' not the 'points' of the past. This thinking needs to change in time. To control all of Lingao, it's not enough just to occupy the Wenlan River basin," He Ming said.

To defend an area, they had to gradually control strategic points on the periphery, using points to cover the area. Making the Piye Mountain area a base was one such measure.

He Ming's explanation silenced the previous doubts. Ma Qianzhu struck while the iron was hot and delivered a report on the next development plan for Lingao, the so-called "Little Crossroads Plan."

In the development history of Hainan Island, from the Song dynasty onward, people had proposed opening "Great Crossroads" across the whole island. The so-called Great Crossroads meant, on the basis of the post roads encircling the island, opening north-south and east-west arterial roads that traversed the entire Hainan Island. This would not only greatly shorten land travel but also strengthen the government's control and development of Hainan Island's interior.

But this concept, from the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, had never been realized. Yuan dynasty armies had once reached the foot of Wuzhi Mountain, erected a stone marker as a record, but ultimately retreated to the coastal areas. Ming dynasty roads had been extended to the foot of Limu Mountain in the interior of Hainan Island, establishing Shuihui Qianhusuo Fort, but they stopped there.

In the Crossing Group's follow-up plans for Hainan Island, there was a new version of the "Great Crossroads Plan." What the Executive Committee currently wanted to implement was the Little Crossroads Plan in Lingao. The central idea was also to strengthen actual control over the entire county through building crossroads.

With good roads, the movement of materials and personnel, the implementation of government orders, and the deployment of troops would all become very convenient. The modern state's strong control over the grassroots and the populace was precisely built on the foundation of good roads and communication networks.

The Little Crossroads Plan not only involved control of the entire county but was also related to the Crossing Group's political, economic, and industrial layout planning for Lingao County. It was a major component of the First Five-Year Plan, second in scale only to the comprehensive management of the Wenlan River basin.

The Little Crossroads Plan already had a certain foundation. Currently, the north-south road traversing Lingao had been opened, with the highway extending from Bopu all the way to Nanbao. The three bases of Bopu, Bairen, and Nanbao, developing from points to lines to areas, not only divided the entire Lingao County in two but also controlled the land on both banks of the Wenlan River most suitable for development, including the county town. Moreover, they actually controlled Lingao County Town. This north-south arterial road not only passed directly in front of the Wenshui Bridge outside the East Gate, but the Crossing Group also used the opportunity of the Tiandihui leasing the school lands to build a branch road to the West Gate. Shan Daoqian's next step was to build a ring road for the county town—although this ring road was only a few hundred meters, it would place the villages and land around the county town completely under control.

Originally, the Crossing Group had set up a watchtower at Wenshui Bridge to monitor the county town, directly watching the East Gate. Now, with School Land Manor established outside the West Gate, they indirectly controlled the West Gate as well. For such a small city as Lingao, with the East and West Gates controlled, the South Gate completely in view, and the North Gate non-existent, the entire county was already completely visible.

Wu De planned to use the watchtower outside the East Gate as the core and settle several dozen immigrant households, forming a new fortified settlement. On one hand, it would monitor the county town; on the other hand, it would also protect the county town as the midpoint of the crossroads. Lingao County Town, with its geographical advantages, was the best crossroads intersection in the "Little Crossroads Plan." The Crossing Group's future positioning for Lingao County Town was "the county's transportation hub and goods distribution center." They planned to first establish a large ox-cart freight center here. For this purpose, they had already purchased some land nearby for use as pasture for the cattle herds.

In longer-term plans, a large transportation transfer center would be built at Wenshui Bridge, consisting of a train station, long-distance bus station, and an inland navigation pier on the Wenlan River. Travelers and goods coming to Lingao would be distributed here to all parts of Lingao and even the whole of Hainan.

The highway passing through the county town extended south all the way to Nanbao. The establishment of Nanbao Town, besides being able to obtain various resources from the Nanbao mountain area, also opened up connections with the Li District of Lingao. It would be more convenient to trade with the Li District and carry out various economic, cultural, and religious infiltrations, in order to completely eliminate potential instability factors in the Li District.

The Crossing Group's positioning of Nanbao was: "A window for Li District trade and a supply base for mining and forestry products." As for Bairen Castle, it was the "manufacturing center and political-military center." Bopu was the "shipping, foreign trade, and chemical center."

After controlling Nanbao, the Crossing Group would also formally establish a fourth commune in the Jialai area north of Nanbao: Jialai Commune. Jialai Plain was one of Lingao's four great plains and was an important agricultural area in modern Lingao. Development in this space-time was at a very low level. According to the Agricultural Committee's survey, because it was close to the Li District, there were very few farming households. Centralized, contiguous development would be relatively easy.

Wu Nanhai planned that once the development of Meitai Plain was complete, he would establish farms in Jialai and set up immigrant settlements, building this area into an agricultural region directly under the Crossing Group.

The current road conditions of the Nanbao-County Town-Bairen Castle-Bopu highway were: the Bopu-Bairen Castle section had completed road surface hardening, with telephone and power transmission poles built along the road. Supporting facilities were complete. The Bairen Castle-County Town section was still undergoing road surface hardening, but the condition of the simple road surface was fairly good.

The worst was the County Town to Nanbao route. Because it was opened hastily, and shortly after opening was repeatedly crushed by large numbers of heavily loaded ox-carts, the road surface was badly damaged. The transportation department spent a large amount of manpower and resources on maintaining the road surface. In his report to the Executive Committee, Shan Daoqian explicitly pointed out that they should either immediately start the hardening project for this section or immediately lay rail transport. With the current large-volume cargo transport, although rail transport had high initial investment, long-term operating costs were low.

In the east-west direction, the Crossing Group had Damei Village, established on the original site after eliminating the Gou Family in the Gaoshan Ridge area to the east. In the Macao Peninsula area to the west, there was Salt Farm Village. Currently, there was a simple road between Damei Village and Lingao County Town. Because of salt production, there had been a flagstone road from Macao to Bopu in the old days, but the condition was also poor. So salt was basically still transported by boat.
