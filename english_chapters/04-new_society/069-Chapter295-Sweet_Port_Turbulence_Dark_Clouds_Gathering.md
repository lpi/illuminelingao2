# Chapter 295: Sweet Port Turbulence — Dark Clouds Gathering

Sun Kecheng knew that this proprietor was generous, but hearing about giving two hundred *liang* still gave him a start. He quickly said, "That's too costly—"

"A life is gone; what's there to say about cost?" Guo Yi said. "I have to trouble Shopkeeper Sun with this matter. Also, if the ship captain's injuries aren't serious, call him and the escort masters together. We'll set a place to talk!" He thought for a moment. "Pick a few sailors to come over and answer questions too!"

"Yes, I'll go do it right now!" Sun Kecheng agreed immediately. "I wonder where Proprietor Guo wants to meet?"

"Question them right here in the escort agency. Immediately." Guo Yi originally wanted to go directly to the Highland Inn, but then thought that with so many people and mixed eyes there, it wasn't a place for questioning.

Half an hour later, everyone had arrived. Guo Yi personally questioned the ship captain, escort masters, and sailors. He learned that five or six small sailing ships had ambushed the *Guang Bing* by the seaside, boarding and fighting with superior numbers against the few. The ship was quickly controlled, but the other side seemed to leave some leeway, not killing too many people, nor taking the ship away. They only divided the sugar into several boats and took it away.

According to the injured escort master, the incoming pirates shouldn't be people from several "big gangs"; they seemed to be some small independent operators who temporarily united to do a job.

"What accent did the comers have?"

"Replying to the Proprietor: All had local Leizhou accents. They should be local scoundrels."

In that case, the possibility that Haiyi Hall instigated this was very high. Guo Yi nodded, "You rest well. All expenses will be covered by me."

Leaving the escort agency, he quickly got into the sedan chair and ordered, "Back to Huifu Street!" He calculated that he had to send a telegram to the South China Factory and Lingao immediately to report. This matter was probably not simple maritime robbery. Although the situation wasn't completely clear yet, the opponent's actions were extremely targeted. The sugar transport matter had to be postponed first—this involved how the Lingao Executive Committee planned to deal with threats at sea.

Guo Yi's telegram was tantamount to a blow to the head for Wen Tong and the others. The content of the telegram was both joyful and worrying. The joy was that Guangzhou clearly informed them that the required silver was not a problem, and South China only needed to be bold in acquiring; the worry was that the sugar ship was hijacked—not only was it a problem of losing five hundred *shi* of sugar, but it also showed that Haiyi Hall had begun to move into a stage of explicitly using illegal means to deal with them.

The most fearful thing in the world was the fish dying and the net breaking, or a dog jumping over a wall in desperation. Haiyi Hall was now at its wits' end. If they dragged on, their chances of winning would get smaller and smaller, so the possibility of adopting such shady means became increasingly large.

How to respond was a difficult problem. Just as he was hesitating, Wen Xiu came in to report, "Shopkeeper Liao is here."

"Which Shopkeeper Liao?"

"It's Grand Shopkeeper Liao."

That would be Liao Dahua of Qiwei. He quickly said, "Invite him!"

The news Liao Dahua brought was even worse. He said the escorts had found out clearly that the sugar shed workers in the whole Xuwen County, including some from Haikang, had all linked up in the past few days. They were preparing to burn incense and swear an oath at the Zou Monk Temple in three days to eradicate the "monster devices" of the South China Factory and "fully restore ancient methods."

This was simply a punch to the heart, almost knocking the wind out of Wen Tong—hijacking the sugar ship wasn't enough; this time they were simply preparing to come and smash the factory directly!

"This, Old Liao, could we ask the government to come forward and suppress it?" Having seen the prestige in the *yamen* last time, if the *yamen* was willing to send some people to suppress it, the workers might not dare to cause trouble.

"The Grand Master in the county wishes for something to happen so he can judge a case. That way he can collect money from both ends." Liao Dahua warned, "The sugar shed workers also have a case to make—after all, their rice bowls were smashed. Now public sentiment outside is turbulent. If a disturbance breaks out, South China is very likely to suffer a big loss. In the end, we might win the lawsuit, but that group of workers is destitute. Even if a few heads are chopped off, what help would it be?"

"Yes, yes, what you plan is correct." Wen Tong knew that in this timeline, counting on the government was basically a fantasy.

"For the plan today, it's better to make plans early." The so-called making plans early was actually a routine for fleeing for their lives. Liao Dahua whispered that he had already arranged a courtyard in Xuwen County seat. If anything happened, they should flee directly into the county seat.

"Once inside the county seat, the chaotic mob would absolutely not dare to chase in easily; otherwise, it would be rebellion. On this point, the shopkeeper can rest assured." Liao Dahua patted his chest. "As long as you are in the city, Qiwei can guarantee everyone's safety."

Wen Tong hesitated, "It won't go that far, right? Do they dare to kill people?" Besides, with so much machinery, equipment, and sugar in the factory, they absolutely couldn't leave it unattended. Otherwise, how would they explain it to the Executive Committee in the future?

"It's hard to guarantee—" Liao Dahua looked grave, "Recently, someone is buying 'substitutes'! The market price is eight hundred *liang* a piece."

"Substitutes?"

"Yes," Liao Dahua nodded. He explained that whenever there was civil unrest or armed fighting, the government wouldn't intervene on the spot. But afterwards, those who injured people had to compensate, and those who killed people had to pay with their lives. To ensure their subordinates could act without scruples, the organizers would often buy "substitutes" in advance. When the government investigated later, the substitute would surrender to the authorities. One life for another, and the matter could pass.

Since someone was buying substitutes, it meant the organizers of this riot were prepared for fatalities. Wen Tong immediately panicked. After all, he was just a sugar factory technician. Originally, he felt that with the Transmigration Group backing him and the Qiwei Escort Agency guaranteeing him locally, and having dealings with the government, he was considered a resounding figure in Xuwen and even Leizhou. Even within the Transmigration Group, both Lingao and Guangzhou had been revolving around South China recently—he felt quite a bit of "King's Aura." Now that the opponent wanted to use knives and guns, he realized that a few of them were isolated here, relying only on the people from Qiwei and a few pistols. If a group of mobsters really charged in to kill, Wen Desi and Ma Qianzhu, no matter how much they bragged, wouldn't have the ability to instantly teleport an army to save his life.

He couldn't help but feel timid: It seemed Shopkeeper Liao was right; he had to prepare an escape route... Didn't President Wen instruct us: "Only survival is the highest priority."

Although he made up his mind, on second thought, he felt that thinking about escaping before anything happened was a bit too cowardly. If someone saw through it, it would be a big laughing stock in the future. So he pretended to be calm and said, "No matter. Let's invite everyone to discuss it first. This South China Factory is a big family business; we can't let people destroy it for no reason."

Immediately, he had people invite Chen Tianxiong, Mei Lin, Xiao Gui, and the others. Liao Daxing was taking care of business in the front, so he wasn't called; right now, the storefront couldn't be without someone in charge.

"Is that Shopkeeper Bei there? Should we invite him?" Wen Xiu asked in a low voice.

"He's back?" Wen Tong felt half at ease upon hearing this. With such a special forces soldier present, the sense of security increased greatly. "Invite, naturally we must invite."

Bei Wei had returned with his people from a staff travel and was resting at the sugar firm. He had also heard that it was unstable outside recently and had originally planned to come over in the evening to talk together.

Hearing Liao Dahua tell the story again, Wen Tong said, "How should we handle this? Haiyi Hall has played two ruthless moves in a row. It looks like they aren't prepared to engage in fair competition with us."

Everyone held their breath and didn't speak. This matter was of great importance, concerning the survival of South China. Not to mention anything else, if South China was really destroyed in their hands, an impression of being "unfit for heavy responsibility" would be left on everyone in the Transmigration Group for the future. Don't even think about administrative positions in charge of a region afterwards; they could only honestly be technicians for a lifetime.

After a long time, Chen Tianxiong said, "Since things have reached this point, we must also make the worst preparations. First, what if the other side attacks? Do we have the ability to protect the factory and goods? Second, if we can't stop them, can we guarantee the safety of ourselves and our subordinates?"

Xiao Gui said, "Actually, if they really attack, we might not necessarily be no match for them. Anyway, there are over a hundred able-bodied men in the sugar factory, and a militia unit has been organized and trained. There are also some escorts. Resisting for a while shouldn't be a problem."

"There are many people," Liao Dahua said. Besides the sugar shed workers, there were also their families. Haiyi Hall would probably also send some hoodlums mixed in. There would be at least a thousand people. "There is one other thing we must guard against. Everyone knows there is a lot of silver in the sugar firm. Once disturbances start, it's not guaranteed that someone won't want to take advantage of the chaos to strike..."

Bei Wei also nodded in agreement with Liao Dahua's judgment. If it were a team like the Salt Field Village Militia, established for a long time, trained well, and united in heart, it would probably be fine. But a rabble like the Sugar Factory Militia, established for less than one or two months, hoping for them to resist a mob ten times their size was unrealistic.

"Don't we have escorts? And Bei Wei's men..." Wen Tong thought of Bei Wei.

"Please, we scouts are humans too, not Kenshiro." Bei Wei smiled bitterly. "Even if we can fight, we might not be able to fight a hundred alone."

"Won't it be fine once the fowling piece fires?" Because Liao Dahua was present, Wen Tong spoke reservedly.

"This is the Ming Dynasty, not South America, and the natives of the Ming Dynasty are not Indians who think we are gods descending to earth. It's easy for the gun to ring, but people also know your thing is a fowling piece, not a divine artifact," Bei Wei said. "Besides, if someone is killed in the sugar factory, how do we end it?"

"Then we'll just directly 'decapitate'..." Seeing Wen Tong hesitating to speak, Liao Dahua quickly said, "I'll go outside and take a look around first. If there's anything, shopkeepers, call me again."

"If it really doesn't work out, we can only do that." Bei Wei nodded. "It's a pity I didn't bring a sniper rifle—didn't even have a rifle, otherwise I would just blow that nuisance Master Zhu's head off from a long distance." He pondered for a moment. "How about I take two people and sneak in tonight to finish him off."

"If we do that, I'm afraid those people in Haiyi Hall will wet their pants in fear." Everyone felt somewhat gratified.

Bei Wei thought for a moment. "However, we don't know the situation inside Haiyi Hall, nor do we know what Master Zhu looks like. We have to scout beforehand. I'll take people tonight to feel out the situation first, treating it as training."

Someone was willing to exert effort, so everyone was naturally happy. But Mei Lin was not enthusiastic about this matter and said, "Can't we strive to win over the workers? I believe they are also being used by others out of helplessness..."

"Being used is certain, but to strive for them to change their attitude, I'm afraid it's too late in just these few days."

"There are still three or four days left after all. If we define going to strive for them, there is still a chance to turn around." He insisted, "The workers are just deceived. In the final analysis, we also smashed their rice bowls, and they had no choice but to rise up and resist..."

People didn't like heating this; it made them seem like evil capitalists—although the fact was indeed so. Wen Tong said, "You mean they are right to make trouble, good to smash, and it's a revolutionary action, huh?"

Mei Lin busily said, "Naturally not, after all, the interests of the Transmigration Group are the most important." Seeing that the atmosphere in the room was unkind, he busily defended himself, "This is also for the sake of the South China Factory and the great cause of transmigration. I am on a short-term business trip to Leizhou; I leave after building the house. South China has to stay open in Xuwen and Leizhou forever. Making enemies before gaining a firm foothold is not a long-term plan."

Putting it this way, it made some sense. But Bei Wei disagreed. Since there was a conflict of interest, unless both sides could fully reconcile and reach a satisfactory interest distribution plan, enmity was inevitable. Worrying about this and that, nothing could be done.

Chen Tianxiong said, "Mei Lin makes some sense. How about this? We should still make several preparations. Both soft and hard measures must be prepared, and we must also take into account shipping sugar to Guangzhou."

"Still shipping sugar to Guangzhou now? It's clear that Haiyi Hall is making trouble in this. Once our sugar ship goes out, it's just giving it away for free."

"Not so," Chen Tianxiong said. "Guangzhou is probably taking a huge risk to mobilize funds for us. Reasonably and emotionally, South China must also transport the sugar there as soon as possible for them to liquidate."

"But what about the safety issue? Now we have enemies on both the shore the sea; we can't attend to both ends." Wen Tong said anxiously.

Chen Tianxiong said, "Food must be eaten one bite at a time; things must be done one by one." He pondered for a moment, counting on his fingers the things to be done one by one:

"The sugar firm needs to speed up the acquisition speed," Chen Tianxiong suggested. "Since Guangzhou said silver is not a problem, we will add a few more weighing personnel. The faster the sugar is collected, the more stable the cane farmers' minds will be, and the order at the gate can also improve. To avoid people fishing in troubled waters, this is one."

"This idea is good," Xiao Gui said. "With the hope of selling sugar at a high price, the cane farmers will absolutely not allow anyone to destroy the sugar factory!"

"Very good, very good!" Wen Tong's spirits lifted greatly. "There are many more cane farmers than sugar shed workers."

"This is just talk." Bei Wei shook his head. "Sugar shed workers are organized and ready to cause trouble; they are not the same thing as cane farmers. What Xiao Gui said is interesting, but unreliable."

"Having someone to help is better than having no one to help," Wen Tong urged Chen Tianxiong. "What's next?"

"Organize the militia to prepare for defense, and prepare a set of contingency plans in case things flare up. This is preparing for a rainy day." Chen Tianxiong said. "In case the militia can't hold and runs away, I personally think it's better to save lives. As long as the green hills remain, there's no fear of running out of firewood."
