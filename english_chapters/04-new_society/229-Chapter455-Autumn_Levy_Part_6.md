# Chapter 455 - Autumn Levy (Part 6)

Thinking of Gou Family Manor's fate, Huang Binkun couldn't suppress a shiver. Third Brother had died at the Baldies' hands—were they now coming to exterminate the entire household?

He recalled how, just a few days ago, his father had suddenly sent his eldest brother and nephew off to the prefectural city to purchase land and establish a new estate, taking along a considerable sum of silver. At the time, he had been puzzled—the family hadn't planned on buying land, and his eldest brother, who served as captain of the village militia, rarely left the estate, let alone for such an extended period. Could his father have already prepared for the worst, arranging a fallback position for the Huang family in the prefectural city?

A cold sweat broke out across his body. He said cautiously, "Father, should we perhaps reinforce the village walls..."

After the defeat at Bairren Rapids, although Huang Shoutong had been wounded, he had kept a constant watch on his family's defenses, guarding against Baldy retaliation. Over several months, the walls had been raised higher, watchtowers added, cannons and matchlocks procured from the mainland, and large quantities of gunpowder and shot manufactured and stockpiled. Grain reserves had been laid in, and several new wells dug.

The militiamen had been on high alert day and night, and this tense state had persisted for a long time—only easing after the Lingao Political Consultative Conference concluded.

Since his son's return with a report on the conference, the old man had paid less attention to Huang Family Village's defenses, concerning himself only with the ordinary threats of bandits and pirates. Huang Binkun also knew that no matter how well the village walls were reinforced, they couldn't withstand the Baldies' artillery. If they wanted to destroy his family, they could do so whenever they pleased.

The sensation of being a fish on someone else's chopping block was deeply unpleasant. The Huang father and son had been secretly discussing for months how to respond to the Baldies.

Retracting their claws and lying low was naturally the best immediate choice, but they believed the Baldies would never let them off. The only long-term solution was to bring in government troops for a campaign of extermination—only then could the matter be settled once and for all.

The government troops of this prefecture were, in theory, stationed throughout the island. The county even had a garrison. But the only force truly capable of fighting was the two thousand or so soldiers at Baisha Naval Station under the Qiongzhou Maritime Defense Command.

Although the Huang father and son were highly esteemed by the county, they were ultimately just rural strongmen. Let alone General Tang of Qiongshan—he wouldn't give them the time of day—even the local garrison officers didn't bother with them. Huang Shoutong had endured their disdain since his youth.

No ability whatsoever, yet each of them thought themselves above everyone else. Incompetent themselves, they wouldn't allow others to show ability either. Unwilling to do anything, yet always scrambling for credit. This was the conclusion Huang Shoutong had reached after decades of cooperating with government troops. Apart from their somewhat passable courage when suppressing Li uprisings—where the enemy was armed with nothing but bamboo and wooden implements—their performance in all other circumstances was truly uninspiring.

Even if General Tang were to commit his entire force, they would be no match for these Baldies. To exterminate them would require a province-wide joint campaign, mobilizing four to six thousand crack troops and two to three hundred warships. Huang Shoutong was startled by his own estimate—wouldn't that require mustering at least ten or twenty thousand men?

This was far beyond Huang Shoutong's capabilities. And so the matter had cooled.

Now, with his own family about to become the chicken slaughtered to warn the monkeys, the Huang father and son found themselves revisiting the issue.

"Reinforcing the walls is pointless," Huang Shoutong said. "We must petition for government troops to mount a campaign."

"That's a tall order—" Huang Binkun had considered this before but hadn't been able to devise any good method to mobilize the military.

"Acting alone, we certainly can't accomplish it. But what about all the gentry of the county together?" Huang Shoutong said. "They want to conduct a land survey now, don't they? Will the major gentry households agree? If we coordinate behind the scenes, we might be able to organize everyone to submit a joint petition."

A joint petition from the county's entire gentry, sent to the provincial capital—that would be no small matter. Whether it was the Governor-General or the Provincial Governor, they would have to respond somehow. If backed by lobbying efforts, the campaign might actually materialize.

"Your son will set about making arrangements at once!" Huang Binkun, being young, was eager to act the moment he saw hope.

"Wait!" Huang Shoutong stopped him. "Not so fast. Right now, people haven't yet seen the Baldies' true colors. Many probably haven't woken up yet and are thinking of simply bowing their heads and enduring. Once Old Eight and his crowd have thrown Lingao into complete chaos and stirred up universal outrage, everyone's resolve will naturally harden."

"Father's guidance is wise!"

"Also, starting tomorrow, you should go back to attending the county school. Listen to what the students are saying and do a little agitating while you're at it. If all the county's scholars were also to submit a petition, the matter would become even more certain."

"Very well. After I return to the county seat, I'll pay a visit to Master Liu." Huang Shoutong instructed. "Ask him what he thinks—with Master Liu, you can be direct. He may not have much land himself, but there's likely a considerable amount registered under his name on others' behalf. He can't stay out of this."

"Your son understands."

"Zhang Youfu should also be visited several times."

"That man has sold himself heart and soul to the Baldies. What's the point of visiting him..."

"Hmph, Zhang Youfu is an old fox; he may not truly have sold himself. We don't expect him to help anyway—he's close to the Baldies, so by visiting him frequently, you can probe for information."

---

All the grain households in the county, at least those of any size, spent these days in chaos. As soon as darkness fell, the heads of households would gather under lamplight, whispering together about strategies for the land survey. Treasures that had been dug up were now buried again. Some families hastily sent people to buy passage to Qiongshan, rushing their trunks and luggage off to relatives in Qiongshan or neighboring counties.

Suddenly, tickets on the Gao Guang shipping line became hot commodities. This anomaly was immediately reported to the Political Security General Administration via both the Harbor Office and the shipping company. Ran Yao didn't dare neglect the matter and quickly dispatched investigators.

"Capital flight?" Wu De glanced at Zhou Botao, who had rushed over to report.

"Exactly. Ever since the grain notices went out, the grain households throughout the county have been in an uproar. There's a serious problem with assets being transferred to other counties."

"Hmm, let them transfer." Wu De said. "They can't take the land with them anyway. As for silver and copper coins—we don't particularly care about those."

"You mean—"

"Them leaving Lingao voluntarily isn't a bad thing for us." Wu De glanced at the report.

The major households couldn't take their land or their farmhands and tenants with them. The land and population left behind would naturally become their property. Unfortunately, most people would probably hold firm—but that was fine too. Let Chen Minggang and his crew thoroughly stir things up and put some pressure on them.

"Damn, so you had this move up your sleeve all along—a disguised land reform?"

"Not at all. It's not land reform." Wu De shook his head. "This is just a side effect." He then asked, "Is the surveillance report ready?"

"Yes." Zhou Botao produced several sheets of paper.

"Anything important?"

"There's one thing you'll definitely find interesting," Zhou Botao said. "Huang Binkun—the son of Huang Shoutong, the militia leader who fought us last year—has gone back to the county school."

"Ah, that old fellow who charged majestically across the ditch and held on for a few minutes before falling from his horse." Wu De still remembered him—the old man had left quite an impression on the transmigrators. "I recall he didn't die."

"He was wounded and fled, then lay low afterward. At the Consultative Conference, he sent his second son—this same Huang Binkun—as his representative. Whether on the Reasonable Burden or bandit suppression, his attitude has been quite cooperative."

"And then?"

Zhou Botao handed over the Huang family's dossier. "It looks like the old fox is up to something behind the scenes."

Wu De opened the surveillance report as Zhou Botao explained: "Huang Binkun claims to be attending the county school, but he's only an additional scholar. Since the school was restored, he's never shown up—until now. His sudden appearance is highly suspicious."

The report listed how, upon arriving in the county seat, he had immediately paid calls on several of the leading gentry, as well as visiting Liu Dalin—the two had talked for nearly two hours. An informant developed among the school's menial staff also reported that during every break, Huang Binkun would deliberately steer conversations with fellow students toward the autumn levy.

"Very suspicious indeed."

"Moreover, the Huang family should be classified among the most dangerous 'reactionary elements,'" Zhou Botao said matter-of-factly. "According to Zhang Youfu's exposé, Huang Shoutong and Liu Dalin were the most active in taking hostile action after D-Day. And the Huang family has a personal vendetta against us—his third son was killed by Guo Yi. So Huang Binkun's current activities are very likely part of some ulterior scheme."

"Then keep watching him and see what he's up to." Wu De smiled. "Actually, I wouldn't mind if a few 'loyal martyrs' emerged from among the major households."

"You're not dealing with him now?"

"Just keep him under surveillance. Don't let him cause trouble. Right now, we're targeting the clerks—the gentry's turn hasn't come yet."

After cleaning up Chen Minggang and his gang of clerks, the next step would be to deal with a few disobedient major households as a warning to others. This was the Executive Committee's established objective. Boiling the frog slowly—one at a time.

"How is the work on Zhou Qi progressing?"

"The rumors have been spread, and we have someone watching him," Zhou Botao said. "We haven't found anything between Zhou Qi and Qiuhong yet..."

"No scandal? Then fabricate one!"

"Well—" Zhou Botao understood his meaning, but it wasn't easy. The ancients weren't fools. If the frame-up was too crude, people wouldn't believe it. "Let me think it over carefully."

"Hurry up. Zhou Qi and his master have been working separately quite a lot lately. Now is the perfect time to plant evidence." Wu De intended to create a serious rift between Zhou Qi and his master, then recruit him.

One purpose of recruiting Zhou Qi was to use him as a consultant. The old tax collection system contained all sorts of abuses and cheating methods—trade secrets invisible no matter how many historical records you read. Zhou Qi had followed Chen Minggang for more than a decade; he must have accumulated substantial knowledge in this area.

Another purpose was to have him make exposés when the clerks were brought to account. As Chen Minggang's senior apprentice, Zhou Qi surely knew plenty of dirty secrets about the clerical class—excellent material for destroying their reputations. People generally connected private morality with public conduct. A private scandal could not only destroy someone but also make their downfall a spectacle the masses would relish.
