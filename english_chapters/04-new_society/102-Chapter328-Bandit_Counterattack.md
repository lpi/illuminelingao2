# Chapter 328 - The Bandits' Counterattack

"Money is something external to the body," Xin Nari secretly cursed Zhao Dachong as a "country bumpkin" and "rural barbarian" for only seeing the few coins in front of him, but patiently persuaded him, "As long as we can keep the team, won't asking for money be just a matter of saying a word in the future?" He counted on his fingers: "Don't complain about too many places to spend money. If you want Liu Si to do a job that risks his head, you have to give enough money to buy his life! Also, these brothers under me, without some money as a reward, will they be willing to go kill?"

"What?! Those little bastards need rewards too..."

"Shh!" Zhao Haixie quickly stopped Zhao Dachong and scolded in a low voice: "The men Fourth Master Xin leads are brothers who have nothing to do with our old Thirteen Villages area!"

"That's right!" Xin Nari said, "I've only been their boss for a few days; on what basis should I ask them to charge into battle?"

"Fine." Although Zhao Dachong felt reluctant, he agreed.

"Finally, appropriate compensation must be given to the families of everyone in the village, has it been given?"

"Those who died were given a few taels of silver," Zhao Dachong became alert, "Still need to give more?"

"That's not necessary, but if not given, it must be given!" Seeing he finally didn't act foolishly, Xin Nari breathed a sigh of relief. "You rest a bit, we leave tonight. Go back and get everything ready for me, send it to this place..."

As soon as it got dark the next day, night shrouded the mountains. Stars twinkled with cold light, occasionally obscured by dark clouds. The deep mountains were even dimmer. The bandit gang hiding in the mountain gullies only began to move at this time.

After days of wandering and displacement, the bandits were all in ragged clothes, with disheveled hair and dirty faces, looking not like bandits but like a group of famine refugees. It was just that they all held various weapons in their hands; those without swords or spears whittled a wooden stick to carry.

Xin Nari and his men had been hiding in the mountains for the past few days, living half-starved and anxiously waiting for news. They dared not go out of the mountains. Villages used to be sources of grain, camping, and women, but now each one suddenly became a hedgehog. They could attract bandit suppression detachments anytime and anywhere, which were hard to shake off once attached. Now that Xin Nari suddenly led everyone out, the bandits didn't know where this newly appointed leader was taking them or what they were going to do. But they dared not speak, each harboring their own sinister designs. After passing through a dense forest, Xin Nari calculated the walking distance and was sure they would arrive at the assembly point before dawn. So he waved for everyone to stop and announced they were going to Daolu Village.

Hearing they could march to the Thirteen Villages area right away, where someone would coordinate and provide food, the group of bandits jumped for joy for a while. Xin Nari took the opportunity to say:

"You can eat, you can play with women! When we get to the place, everyone will be given pay!" He paused, "There are only two female Short-hairs in the village, plus seven or eight soldiers. Everyone muster your strength and wipe them out!"

Hearing they had to fight Short-hairs again, the bandits muttered again. Xin Nari hurriedly cheered them up: "Brothers, rest assured! We have an insider with the Australians. When the time comes, their bird guns won't fire! Defeat the Australians, and we eat, drink, and play in the village for three days!"

The latter sentence was equivalent to granting a big holiday—rob whatever you want, play with whomever you want. The bandits hadn't lived such days for a long time, and a small commotion instantly arose in the crowd. Someone shouted: "Boss Xin, stop talking nonsense, take us there!"

"Good, let's go!"

They arrived outside Daolu Village before dawn. Xin Nari carefully hid the team in the mountain forest a few *li* away. Zhao Dachong and Zhao Haixie had already arrived in the village a step ahead, mobilizing bandit families overnight to cook rice and boil water, quietly sending it to the woods.

Seeing food arrive, the bandits couldn't help but swarm up to fight for it—they hadn't eaten a decent meal for many days, and the lack of salt made their bodies feel fatigued and weak at all times. Xin Nari ordered one tael of silver to be distributed to each person and told them to sleep and rest first.

Zhao Dachong, Zhao Haixie, and Zhao Haiji were all waiting for him. The four gathered together to discuss how to act.

"Old Man Mei said the two women haven't left yet, but six or seven guards have already left. Heard they went to pick up the succeeding captain."

"Now there are only twelve or thirteen guards left. Just two extra women, no hindrance!" Xin Nari had some confidence now. "How is the buying of Liu Si to sabotage the ammo going?"

"That cost a lot of money." Zhao Dachong felt very pained. "This kid played hard to get at first, saying it's hard to damage the ammo. These soldiers never leave their ammo pouches, and someone stands guard when sleeping at night; there's no chance at all."

"What happened later?"

"We promised him more silver, and also said we'd give Xin Nachun to him..." Zhao Dachong had a loose mouth and didn't notice Zhao Haixie winking at him at all.

Xin Nari remained calm: "He agreed."

"Agreed, but not firmly." Zhao Haixie feared this young master would speak indiscriminately again and blurt out something like "slut," provoking Xin Nari, so he quickly took over, "He said damaging the ammo is unlikely, but he can damage the guns so they won't fire."

Xin Nari thought: *Agreing not firmly is likely true. If this Liu Si ran a train with his mouth full (bluffed) and patted his chest guaranteeing it, I would have to think about it carefully.*

"Actually, isn't promising him anything just empty words!" Zhao Haiji said, "After the deed is done, just directly—" He made a chopping motion.

If the person died, naturally neither silver nor women were needed.

"No," Xin Nari immediately opposed, "Liu Si must be kept. Whatever promised to him must be given without shortage."

"On what basis?" Zhao Dachong shouted out. He had long planned to kill Liu Si after the deed was done, not for Xin Nachun, but because the valuables promised to Liu Si were truly substantial—he was heartbroken over the cost.

"Liu Si was cultivated by the Australians single-handedly; he knows a lot about the Australians' foundation." Xin Nari had thought about this for a few days. "From the looks of it, the Australians won't leave anytime soon. If we want to deal with them, we need this person to lead the way!"

Zhao Haixie nodded: "Fourth Master Xin is right. We shouldn't be too stingy on this matter. Pull him into the gang!"

Zhao Dachong had to agree as well.

"Tell me, how do we plan to strike?" Xin Nari asked.

"Liu Si said he could settle the ammo matter before noon. We strike at noon." Zhao Haixie said, "It's hot after noon; most people take a nap. Rush into the ancestral hall and catch them off guard."

"How about the families of each household? Are they all ready?"

"More than sixty people came in one breath. Hearing we are going to hit the Australian guys, everyone wants revenge. Women have even taken up scissors." Zhao Dachong said excitedly, "I persuaded the too old and too young to go back."

"Families shouldn't go into battle." Xin Nari thought for a moment, "Pick a few who know the roads well and have fast legs to meet us at the village entrance and lead the way. The others guard the roads around the village entrance to prevent anyone from running away."

"Good!" Everyone agreed.

"Also, hang a blue cloth strip on the doors of our families." Xin Nari said, "My current brothers are not from this village; it would be ugly if they crashed into our own people."

"This is easy to handle; I'll notify each family as soon as I go back." Zhao Haixie said.

"Who takes care of opening the ancestral hall door?"

"Agreed upon, front door is Liu Si, back door is Old Man Mei." Zhao Dachong said, "I promised Old Man Mei land and silver."

"This old thing's legs are still nimble." Xin Nari nodded, "No need to keep him then."

"In a while, we'll use three *Gaosheng* (double-bang) firecrackers as the signal; all routes launch together!" Xin Nari's face changed, becoming murderous. Zhao Dachong, who originally calculated to be the boss later, couldn't help feeling a chill. Seeing his clan elders obey this outsider completely, he had great doubts about whether he could become the boss in the future.

*Damn it, you can't be kept either!* Zhao Dachong glared viciously at Xin Nari, who went to deploy his men, touched the small dagger in his bosom, and murderous intent had already arisen.

Just past noon, on the dirt road three *li* away, a mass of black muddy current was rushing wildly. More than fifty ragged bandits, waving knives and guns beginning to rust in their hands, pounced towards Daolu Village.

The bandits didn't shout, just ran wildly. At the village entrance, some half-grown boys or young women wearing white flowers in their hair were waiting, holding wooden sticks just sharpened with white stubble exposed. They met the bandits and ran towards the ancestral hall. Although they didn't utter a word, every eye was spitting fire. Some due to greed, some purely out of hatred.

Originally, there were a few people working or chatting on the street. Seeing this scene, they were all dumbfounded with fright, rolling and crawling back into their houses, closing the doors, shivering and listening to the movement outside.

As expected, the main gate of the ancestral hall was open as planned. Liu Si was looking around anxiously by the door. Seeing them come, his face instantly relaxed greatly. While waving, he pushed the door open wider. Zhao Haixie took the lead and jumped up the steps.

"How is it?"

"Good guys, took a hell of an effort to take out the sentries," Liu Si raised his head, "The others are all meeting in the back..."

Zhao Haixie ordered: "Guard the main gate!", then he and Zhao Dachong led the main force rushing straight in. There was no one in the first courtyard, only some soldiers' things like bundles and quilts neatly arranged in the rooms.

Although the absence of a single person aroused a trace of suspicion in his heart, once the momentum was up, he couldn't care about so much. Zhao Haixie smashed open the door of the second courtyard, and everyone yelled and surged in together.

Just then, from the back alley, many people also shouted and surged out, each holding knives and guns, waving and charging over. Both sides were stunned when they saw each other.

This was Xin Nari's group that rushed in from the back door!

Xin Nari led the men attacking the rear courtyard through the open door and smoothly entered the chapel (third courtyard/rear hall). Besides Old Man Mei, there were a few old people who frequently came on normal days in the chapel, all frozen with fear. Xin Nari had no time to pay attention to them and led people straight into the second courtyard. Unexpectedly, he ran head-on into the people coming in from the front door.

The entire second courtyard was empty. Not to mention the Work Team, not even a ghost was there.

Just as Zhao Haixie wanted to lead men to search the rooms, suddenly a volley of gunshots came from the street outside.

This whistling sound signifying death made him shudder all over. Looking for Liu Si again, he was nowhere to be found!

"It's a trap!" Zhao Haixie couldn't help shouting, "Run quickly—"

His men were instantly in chaos; some went forward, some went backward, and some climbed the walls directly. The courtyard instantly turned into a pot of porridge.

On the roof, a dozen soldiers climbed up, firing rifles volley after volley into the courtyard. Xin Nari didn't even have time to shout "It's a trap." The opponent had already fired the first volley, and five or six bandits around him had already fallen. The rest turned and ran. Then countless hand grenades were thrown down, iron pieces and porcelain fragments flying in the courtyard—bandits beaten bloody all over groaned painfully on the ground. The bandit gang completely lost order; gunshots and explosions rose one after another.

Xin Nari was quick-witted and had already retreated to the chapel in the third courtyard. It was empty here with no one. The bandits responsible for guarding the main gate were gone, but the back door was still open. He felt slightly relieved and quickly waved his hand: "Run to the back door!"

The bandits surged towards the back door in a chaotic mass. "Where do you think you're going!" A female general turned out from the back door, wearing a stab-proof vest, an 80-style steel helmet on her head, and holding an eyebrow-level steel spear in her hand. She looked majestic and heroic. It was none other than Dong Weiwei! She had practiced bodybuilding, and her physical fitness was excellent. Whether height or physique, she was much stronger than the average man of this timeline. She raised her spear and stabbed down the fastest bandit.

"Brothers, fight!" Xin Nari saw only a woman guarding the door and knew something was fishy. He just waved his machete, coaxing the surviving bandits around him to howl and swarm over, wanting to kill their way out to seize the door and escape. A row of soldiers popped up behind Dong Weiwei, fired another volley, followed by a burst of canister shot (grenade dischargers). The courtyard was instantly littered with corpses and wounded.

Xin Nari, however, didn't charge with his subordinate bandits. Taking advantage of the chaos, he slipped to the side, ran into a narrow alleyway, quickly climbed over the wall, and escaped this trap.

He simply couldn't care how many brothers could run out, just running straight out of the village—he couldn't stay in the village; escaping was the priority.

On the road, he met Zhao Dachong, who was waiting on the street for coordination, his face also blackened by gunpowder smoke, waving a précieux sword.

"It's a trap, *Damn it*!" Zhao Dachong cursed, "That bastard Liu Si, I'll skin him—"

"Go quickly, what's the use of saying this!" Xin Nari couldn't care less about Liu Si or Liu Wu, leaving him behind and running wildly.

The battle ended very quickly. Zhao Haiji, Zhao Haixie, and Zhao Dachong were all killed. Xin Nachun, who was originally leading a dozen bandit family members on the street for coordination, rolled onto the ground and played dead after the suddenly appearing soldiers fired wildly and hit a few people. When clearing the battlefield, she was kicked hard a few times before reluctantly climbing up, tied up with ropes along with other prisoners. Fifty or so people brought by Xin Nari, plus more than thirty bandit family members mobilized by Zhao Dachong in the village, were killed or captured; not a single one escaped.
