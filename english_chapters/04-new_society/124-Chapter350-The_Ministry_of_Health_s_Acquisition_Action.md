# Chapter 350 - The Ministry of Health's Acquisition Action

"In terms of medicinal materials and pharmacology, I am superior to him, but regarding the medicinal material trade and pharmacy management in this space-time, I am a layman. This counts as complementary advantages for both sides."

"Will the other party agree? How is Runshitang's economic situation?"

"I've sounded them out," Liu San said. "Runshitang is owned by Shopkeeper Yang himself. His family has been doing this for generations. This Runshitang was opened by Shopkeeper Yang's father after coming over from Guangdong. Business conditions these years have been average, just getting by. Not long after the old man died and Shopkeeper Yang took over, a ship of medicinal materials was robbed by pirates, making the situation even more straitened."

"This is his ancestral property; selling ancestral assets might not be acceptable to ancient people."

"I've thought about this. Acquisition by equity system works best. Keep some shares for Shopkeeper Yang, don't change the signboard, keep personnel generally unchanged, and he remains the shopkeeper cum shareholder—his face is saved too. Of course, we hold the controlling stake appropriately."

Liu San continued, "After I become the owner, I can openly supervise work directly, focusing my main energy on Chinese patent medicine production. Then use their business cooperation channels to first open up the medicinal material purchase channels in Qiongshan County. Then borrow their connections to visit the mainland—Shopkeeper Yang has several uncles opening herbal medicine shops or working as doctors on the mainland. Look around everywhere, get to know more people, acquire medicinal materials along the way, and recruit some professional Chinese medicine processing talents back."

Shi Niaoren nodded. "This line of thought is quite good. How much budget?"

"Buying this shop, including livelihood assets and inventory, won't cost two hundred taels of silver." Liu San said, "But expansion and renovation will be a big expense..."

"How do you plan to expand and renovate? Set up a specialized Chinese medicine processing factory?"

"That's unnecessary. With such a good environment in the pharmaceutical factory available now, why would I run to the county town full of pig and chicken manure to open a pharmaceutical factory?" Liu San had a well-thought-out plan. "I intend to merge the processing talents in the pharmacy into the Traditional Chinese Medicine workshop of the pharmaceutical factory to work. The pharmacy will only be responsible for drug sales, procurement, and distribution..."

"Distribution?"

"Yes, Lingao has many wild Chinese medicinal material resources, such as Alpinia oxyphylla discovered by the resources department last time. The honey locust found by the round-the-island expedition team this time can also be exported besides satisfying self-use." Liu San continued, "I plan to move the head office to East Gate Market after taking over, building a magnificent grand pharmacy. The old shop in the city counts as a branch. Later, open pharmacy branches in various markets throughout the county first—the Ministry of Health's 'Medicine to the Countryside' can proceed under the guise of the pharmacy's 'Sitting Doctor', which saves more effort than everyone going from village to village and makes it easier for common people to trust..."

"You really have a way."

"Not finished yet. Through the channel of exporting medicinal materials, we will gradually distribute tentacles to various key points on the mainland, establish brands, start selling various special medicines from the pharmaceutical factory, and further enhance the prestige of the Transmigration Group and 'Australian Goods'. If one day the Executive Committee plans to play tricks and set up a Cult of Light, pharmacies selling special medicines can serve as missionary points..."

Hearing Liu San's ambitious overall plan, Shi Niaoren lamented again: There are capable people in the Transmigration Group! Such a figure was actually hidden in his Ministry of Health.

"Putting it this way, if I don't fight for the budget, it seems I can't justify myself." Shi Niaoren joked, "Let's not talk about later matters first. How much budget is needed for acquisition plus moving and building houses?"

"This is the budget list. About four hundred taels of silver should be enough. Medicinal material inventory conversion, working capital, housing, and opening fees for the new store, etc."

"Make it four hundred taels then. I'll approve it for you. There shouldn't be a problem with the Planning Committee; silver isn't a first-grade material, and the amount you want isn't large." Shi Niaoren cracked a joke.

Liu San packed a box of various homemade medicines for him to use for clinical trials. Shi Niaoren thought this was simply skipping animal experiments and using them directly on humans—this was the true "Great Leap Forward".

Coming out of Liu San's workshop, Hu Yicheng was still enthusiastically fiddling with something. Shi Niaoren leaned close to look; they were several large wide-mouthed glass jars. In one sealed with gauze, suspicious green cilia floated at the bottom, a layer of jellyfish-skin-like bacterial film floated on the liquid surface, plus some milky white translucent gelatinous bacterial masses. The smell wasn't unpleasant, sweet and sour.

Several other large jars were unremarkable, filled with dark red liquid. The liquid was a bit turbid, with some foam and scum on the surface.

Seeing Shi Niaoren looking, Hu Yicheng hurriedly said, "Minister Shi, want a cup?"

Shi Niaoren was startled; this thing didn't look drinkable no matter how one looked at it. "What is this?"

"Kombucha, a health and nutritional drink." Hu Yicheng actually wasn't interested in the so-called efficacy of this troublesome Kombucha; it was just a pastime seeing the distiller idle: now sugar and tea supply was abundant, and Huang Dashan's laboratory had many strains, so he just used it to do side jobs and review his craft.

Shi Niaoren intended to decline, but suddenly thought his salt soda plan hadn't settled yet. Although Kvass was created by Huang Dashan of this factory, the producing enterprises were the Agricultural Committee and the Ministry of Light Industry, having nothing to do with the Ministry of Health. However, the concept of this Kombucha was not bad...

Hu Yicheng saw the leader's face changing unpredictably, not knowing the depth, thinking Minister Shi was indeed very leader-like; how could we learn this appearance? While admiring, he saw Shi Niaoren's expression change, feeling quite righteous and awe-inspiring.

"Give me a cup."

"Okay, okay," Hu Yicheng said while hurriedly pouring a cup. Seeing the leader's appearance seemed to be making a determination, Hu Yicheng hurriedly said, "It's fine, we tested the components; no harmful substances. Everyone drinks a few mouthfuls when working overtime at night. Don't know if there are benefits, but definitely no harm."

"It's fine." Saying this, Shi Niaoren tilted his neck and drank this liquid looking like black tea.

The taste was much better than imagined, sweet and sour. If there was any special taste, it was a bit like sour plum soup mixed with black tea. If it could be iced, the taste should be good.

"Taste is not bad," Shi Niaoren commented. "How about cost?"

"No cost really: just tea leaves and sugar. The strain was obtained by Huang Dashan; just culture it ourselves." Hu Yicheng felt strange; this thing was just made for fun, what cost problem?

"Little Hu, this is a 'Health Supplement', yes, Health Supplement!" Shi Niaoren got excited—not knowing if it was the effect of the Kombucha he just drank. "Such a good thing can't stay in the laboratory. We must let the broad masses of people enjoy it, and also our laborers; distribute this to them as nutritional products..."

"Such a good thing?" Hu Yicheng was surprised. With Minister Shi's cultivation, he couldn't be unaware that Kombucha was basically a gimmick. Birds of a feather with things like snake oil. Did Minister Shi really think it was some panacea?

"You immediately calculate with Huang Dashan, get more fermentation utensils, prepare for mass production. I'll talk to Wu Nanhai about sugar and tea quotas." Shi Niaoren thought for a moment. "Make the drinking liquid cleaner, filter it, try to make it clear and transparent."

"Okay, okay." Hu Yicheng never dreamed that Kombucha could suit Minister Shi's appetite so much. "This matter is very easy..."

"After making it, I'll tell Xiao Zishan to supply it to everyone as a health drink." Shi Niaoren emphasized the word "Health" very heavily. "Find Dashan, discuss writing a draft on the health effects of Kombucha. I'll find someone to print it and post it in the canteen..."

Liu San got Shi Niaoren's approval, confidence surging. He changed into blue cloth outer clothes for house calls and herbal gathering, put on a bamboo hat, carried his army green canvas satchel on his back, and walked towards the county town.

Runshitang was on the only County Front Street in the county town, not far from the East Gate settlement. Since the Transmigration Group and the County Yamen reached a tacit agreement and both sides coexisted peacefully, transmigrators could freely enter and exit the county town. At first, Wu Mingjin and others were still very nervous, summoning street and neighborhood heads and Baojia chiefs of the settlements outside the three gates, instructing inns, shops, and households in the city not to allow Australians to stay overnight; those forcibly demanding to stay must be reported to the County Yamen for record. Discerning people could see that this so-called "defense" was just a joke. Did Australians need to engage in "coordination from inside and outside" to attack the city?

Fortunately, "Australians" had no interest in staying overnight in the city either, always coming by day and leaving by night. After the first few weeks passed, the transmigrators' curiosity about this Great Ming county town had been completely exhausted. Recently, except for a rare few people coming to the city for business, almost no one entered the city.

No one entered the city, but more and more people left the city—not only did Australians not enter the city, but even local county citizens entered the city less and less. Relying on convenient and safe transportation facilities and a wide variety of commodities, East Gate Market attracted a large number of local villagers. Coupled with the transmigrators' full support for East Gate Market, its popularity became better and better, while the County Market became increasingly depressed. Many shops sent people to open branches or set up stalls in East Gate Market, and some simply moved over directly.

The operation of the herbal medicine shop Runshitang was still passable. It was the only local pharmacy here, with no other branch. Sporadic medicine stalls or TCM doctors preparing medicine themselves mostly purchased goods from here. The reason was none other than: most Chinese medicinal materials had to undergo processing (*Paozhi*). In Lingao County, only Runshitang had processed medicinal materials.

Since Liu San started planting medicinal materials on the farm, he learned from the long-term workers helping in the herb garden that there was such a place in the county. Out of professional curiosity, he naturally wanted to see what a Great Ming pharmacy looked like. Once the situation stabilized, he visited.

The shopkeeper and staff of Runshitang were somewhat respectful but distant when they first saw a "Hairless Thief" visiting. But as time passed, they found that although this "Hairless Thief" was an overseas person, he knew a lot about medical principles and medicinal properties, especially having extremely rich knowledge in medicinal materials. Since they had common topics, they slowly became warm.

Because of the shortage of medicine, Liu San often had to dispense Chinese medicine for people. Self-produced medicinal materials were incomplete, so he came here to purchase, counting as one of the shop's big customers.

Runshitang's storefront was quite magnificent, with high rooms and open porches. A large plaque with gold characters hung on the lintel. It was just that after a long time, it had peeled off a bit. Quite a lot of green grass also grew under the steps.

The entire house had a shop in front and a yard in back, with an attached residential courtyard; one could see that a lot of money was spent back then. Liu San heard from the shop assistant that Runshitang's old shopkeeper came from a family of pharmacy owners in Guangdong. When he came to Lingao back then, he had quite an ambition to open a business and establish a foundation. Thinking of this, Liu San couldn't help sighing secretly in his heart.

Stepping onto the bluestone steps, he felt a stream of cool air hitting him, feeling very comfortable in the hot and sultry weather.

"Mr. Liu is here!" The greeting of a shop assistant came from the dim shop hall—he was already a familiar guest here who couldn't be more familiar.

Someone inside had already welcomed him out; it was the manager of this shop, Liu Benshan. Liu Benshan was over fifty; hearing him say he followed the old shopkeeper as an apprentice from the age of eleven, he counted as an "old retainer" in the shop. Ordinary affairs in the shop were handled by him.

"Business is booming!" Liu San cupped his hands and exchanged pleasantries as usual.

"Thanks to your blessing! Thanks to your blessing!" Liu Benshan didn't mind—anyway, since he became an apprentice, Runshitang's business had been like this: neither dead nor alive, barely getting by. It encountered big crises several times; originally thought it couldn't survive, but by some miracle he muddled through too.

Liu San swept a glance at the shop hall. Various utensils were placed neatly on the dark wooden counter, wiped spotless. The copper fittings on the medicine drawers behind also shone brightly—no matter how depressed the business was, the rules were not vague at all. This was also the reason he liked coming here: no perfunctoriness or carelessness.

If this were a crappy shop, he wouldn't bother acquiring it; he would just open one himself and squeeze it out of business.

A young shop assistant served boiled Prunella tea—because business was bad, this shop hadn't recruited apprentices for many years. This so-called young shop assistant was also in his early twenties. Ancient people stressed lifelong employment; once employed, as long as the business could continue and the assistant had no serious disciplinary violations, everyone would just make do.

Runshitang's business worsened day by day since the old shopkeeper passed away, so the scale of assistants remained at six or seven people, including front counter and back yard; all businesses were included.

Liu San drank a mouthful of tea. This shop's Prunella tea was boiled authentically and chilled thoroughly with well water. It tasted fresh, moist, and refreshing, very effective for dispelling summer heat.

"Shopkeeper Yang isn't in?" Every time Liu San came, Shopkeeper Yang always came out to meet guests quickly—he was very interested in Australian medicine, especially the way Australians injected liquid medicine into human bodies with needles to treat diseases, often inquiring about the principles. Liu San also explained some basic principles of modern medicine such as intramuscular injection, intravenous, arterial, microbial infection, antibiotics, etc., to him, making Shopkeeper Yang unable to stop wanting more. Traditional Chinese medicine shops often didn't separate medicine from medical practice; shopkeepers and assistants knew some medical skills more or less. Naturally, they had a strong interest in such unheard-of new medical skills.
