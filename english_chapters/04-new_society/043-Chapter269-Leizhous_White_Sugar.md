# Chapter 269 Leizhou's White Sugar

Seeing the completely defeated Dingding, the fatty stood up and said amiably, "Comrade, good principles can only be effective in the right environment. Don't apply them rigidly. This is a guideline from the Internal Affairs section concerning such reports. Take it back, modify the article, and if it can't run in the morning edition, it can still go in the evening edition. If you have further concerns, we can discuss them in detail."

Watching Dingding leave with the document, the fatty stood up, still wearing that gentle smile, and returned to his office.

The official name of his office was the "Internal Affairs Committee Policy Research Office." This name didn't represent anything concrete—it was merely to satisfy his desire not to do operational work, only political studies. It was essentially an advisory position for the Internal Affairs Committee.

The office was clean and tidy. A Holy Ship brand whitewood desk was piled with homemade filing racks and bins. There was also a large bookshelf stacked with many books. The only modern items were a laptop computer and several CD cases.

Behind the desk stood an ornate, elegant screen strikingly out of place with the surroundings. Behind it was a simple whitewood cot with a mosquito net, a clothes rack, and a small cabinet. It was the quintessential setup of an old-fashioned bachelor living in a government office.

Judging from the office's furnishings, this person didn't hold a particularly high position among the Executive Committee's various departments. There was no hand-crank telephone on the desk—the symbol of power that was standard issue for department heads.

He plopped down in his worn rattan chair and took a document from the basket labeled "In." It was folded like a letter, with a red "Secret" stamp across the seal. He opened it; inside was a translated telegram from Guangzhou.

The telegram concerned the background investigation of Li Huamei in Macau. He read it very carefully.

**Background Investigation Report on Li Huamei**
*Classified*

**To: Center**

Upon receiving instructions, I immediately began investigating Li Huamei's origins and background.

In Guangzhou, almost no information could be obtained about her or her *Hangzhou*. In comparison, there was more information about Li Siya. However, the information about Li Siya is mostly hearsay; we have not been able to achieve any substantial breakthrough beyond what we previously knew.

Therefore, I decided to dispatch Zhang Xin to Macau to conduct a direct investigation. In the trade dealings between the Guangzhou Station and Macau, he has played a very important role and established a relatively solid personal relationship with Huang Shunlong. Huang Shunlong has long dealt with various maritime powers in Macau and is knowledgeable about the various forces. Before we establish our own intelligence network in Macau, I believe using the Huang Shunlong channel is feasible.

Zhang Xin went to Macau under the guise of trading liquor. I authorized him to carry out the following activities: He disclosed to Huang Shunlong that he had recently encountered a female pirate at sea and described the vessel and flag to him. Based on his on-the-spot reaction, Zhang Xin judged that Huang Shunlong knew something about it. Initially, Huang was unwilling to talk much about this matter, but under Zhang Xin's further probing, he revealed the following information:

He had seen a ship similar to the *Hangzhou* docked in the harbor multiple times. However, he couldn't say who the ship belonged to. The only thing he knew was that the captain was a woman; of this he was absolutely certain. We showed him a computer-drawn portrait based on Li Huamei's photograph for identification. He again demurred, saying he hadn't looked closely enough at the real person to recognize her. However, Zhang Xin believes: the person he saw was Li Huamei.

Zhang Xin noted: In conversation, Huang Shunlong was very reluctant to mention any ships or captains that docked locally. He claimed ignorance regarding all such inquiries. We speculate: this is directly connected to his business dealings with pirates—he fears inadvertently revealing their secrets in conversation. However, his unfamiliarity with Li Huamei should be credible. Therefore, we infer: Li Huamei is probably not a pirate, or at least her piracy activities are not near the Chinese coast. From this perspective, Li Huamei's claim that she trades with Goa has a degree of credibility.

The next day, Zhang Xin directly investigated sailors and related personnel on the docks. From these people, he confirmed the periodicity of the *Hangzhou*'s appearances in Macau. Every year around June, it arrives in Macau and then makes irregular voyages to various regions of Southeast Asia. Each voyage lasts about a month. The *Hangzhou* departs for good in December. This cycle matches the Macau-Goa trade cycle. Furthermore, through photo identification, they again confirmed: Li Huamei is indeed the captain of the *Hangzhou*. Port personnel know little about her—they don't even know where she stays when she's in port.

Regarding Headquarters' specific request to investigate whether there is a connection between Li Huamei and Li Siya, there is almost no source of intelligence on this matter. Due to language and network limitations, Zhang Xin's investigation could only be conducted within Chinese circles. However, most local Chinese had never heard of such a person; few even knew that a female captain regularly visited. Some confused her with Li Siya. Incidentally: local Chinese hold a kind of "curiosity" about Li Siya. Rumors abound, but knowledge of her actual circumstances is scarce. Rumors mainly focus on her killing and arson; based on the compiled information, we infer she has participated in multiple attacks on Moon Harbor in addition to robberies at sea.

We believe it cannot be ruled out that the two Lis are acquainted, collaborating, or have some other deeper relationship. After all, they both have significant ties to the Portuguese. If Li Siya's connection is through bloodline, then Li Huamei, as a pure Chinese, exhibiting so many Portuguese elements seems strange. She couldn't have acquired all this out of thin air.

This is all we have collected so far regarding Li Huamei's background investigation. Per instructions, we will continue to gather intelligence on her. I will report any new developments to Headquarters immediately.

*Signed: Ziyan, Guangzhou Station*

The fatty stamped the telegram "Reviewed" and picked up another document.

This was a telegram from the *Hangzhou*, using the "Internal Secret" cipher. The message was only a few lines, but the information was very important: Li Huamei had climbed into the engine room of the *Zhenhai* in the middle of the night. She was inside for at least ten minutes.

"You are truly a unique woman." The fatty murmured to himself. After pondering for a moment, he took out a file folder, placed both telegrams inside, and noted the document summary and number on the cover. Then he put it in the "Out" basket.

**Xuwen County, Leizhou.**

Two sedan chairs, each carried by two bearers, were making their way down a dusty road. About a dozen servants in blue attire followed on foot, along with five or six mounted escort guards. Each was either armed with a bamboo staff or had a fast blade at the waist. The security was tight, and the small gangs of bandits along the road gave them a wide berth.

Wen Tong dozed in his sedan chair. He had grown somewhat accustomed to the swaying and bumping; the first time he'd ridden in one, he'd nearly vomited. On television, wealthy people made riding in sedan chairs look like an indulgence. At first, he'd found it rather interesting too. But after a while, it became unbearable—inside the sedan wasn't a sofa, but a hard-backed chair. After a long time, one's back and waist ached terribly.

Since the sugarcane harvest began at the end of the previous year, Wen Tong had been dispatched to Leizhou as a Sugar Industry Special Envoy for the Lingao Grain and Oil Company. His sole mission was to inspect and supervise local white sugar production, find the most suitable manufacturing process for the area, and build up Leizhou as a hub for the transmigrators' sugar exports.

The Ming-era Xuwen County, located in what is now Zhanjiang City, remained one of China's largest sugar production bases even into modern times, on par with Guangxi and Yunnan. Wen Tong, hailing from a sugar-industry family, was naturally familiar with it all. Back when the Agriculture Ministry had debated whether to grow sugarcane in Lingao, he had been strongly opposed. Lingao could grow sugarcane, but it wasn't an ideal production zone. Sugarcane was a cash crop that heavily consumed water and fertility; promoting it would seriously impact local grain production. Xuwen, across the strait, was a traditional sugar production area in China. Why not utilize it rather than duplicate efforts in Lingao?

For this reason, starting in the winter of 1628, the Guangzhou Station, while establishing overland routes and networks in Leizhou, had begun large-scale acquisitions of sugarcane fields and sugar mills. By the start of this crushing season, Lingao Grain and Oil Company had, in Haikang and Xuwen counties, taken control of nine sugarcane estates totaling 2,600 *mu* of cane fields and five sugar mills.

The ambitions of Lingao Grain and Oil Company didn't stop at 2,600 *mu* of sugarcane. Wen Tong's instructions were: whenever possible, acquire local sugarcane or raw sugar and use the advanced sugar-making technology mastered by the transmigrators to mass-produce low-priced white sugar and rapidly capture the market.

*"Advanced sugar-making technology—that's a bit of a pipe dream."* Wen Tong had thought bitterly when he received these instructions. He didn't have any specialized sugar factory equipment. How could he claim advanced technology? The transmigrators' only advantage over ordinary cane farmers was the ability to manufacture some specialized processing machinery, higher labor productivity, better utilization of sugar by-products, and lower overall costs.

After landing, Wen Tong's first step was to quickly tour the main sugarcane production areas of both counties, observing the planting, harvesting, and processing of sugarcane. He had a general idea of what old-style sugar-making equipment and processes looked like, but those were Qing Dynasty remnants. He had never actually seen what Ming Dynasty equipment looked like.

To ensure Wen Tong's safety, the Executive Committee had assigned Zhou Shizhai, a police station consultant, along with an apprentice, to serve as his personal bodyguards. Zhou and the Qiwei Escort Agency people came from the same escort background, making communication easier. In addition, there was another transmigrator, Chang Shide, accompanying him. Chang had nothing to do with the sugar or sugarcane industry, but he was tall and solidly built, a military enthusiast who had trained for several months and handled weapons competently—he could even swing a demon-head sword around. He wasn't sent for his combat prowess but mainly so the two transmigrators could have someone to talk to. Unlike being around natives, with whom they had no common language.

Thanks to Qiwei's extensive network in Leizhou, Wen Tong's sugarcane journey was both convenient and safe. After landing at Denglong Point, the manager of Qiwei's Leizhou Haikang branch was already waiting with sedan chairs and escort guards.
