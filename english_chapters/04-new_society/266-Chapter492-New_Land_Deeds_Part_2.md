# Chapter 492 - New Land Deeds (Part 2)

The surveying and verification work took a considerable amount of time. Finally, under modern surveying methods, problems were resolved one by one, and the land status on the Meiyang Village map placed in the center of the big tent gradually became clear. The map on the floor was marked with numerous numbers and colored blocks that only professionals could understand. Colorful and densely packed, it looked like an abstract painting.

From the gradually clarifying survey map, it was easy to see that some people had concealed their acreage. Many surveyed fields had no declarants. These were undoubtedly hidden fields. To be prudent, Wang Ruixiang specially met with Fu Buer and some village elders to find out if any outside landlords had bought land in the village, and received a negative answer.

"Alright, now you're going to be the chickens," Wang Ruixiang thought to himself in his tent. As for exactly who hadn't declared, he wasn't in a rush to find out. They would confess of their own accord when the land deeds were issued.

On this day, Wang Ruixiang held a village-wide meeting on the village threshing floor to issue the new land deeds on the spot.

The new land deeds adopted a double-page certificate format with a unified serial number. The cover and back cover were made of thick cardboard, durable and wear-resistant. The paper was also heavy-duty cardstock with watermarks produced by the paper mill. To avoid the trouble of changing land deeds again after establishing independence later, the new land deeds only used the name of the Lingao County Grain Collection Bureau and were stamped with the Bureau's official seal. Only the last page bore the official seal of the Lingao County Magistrate—to gain the people's trust, since the flag of the Great Ming hadn't been discarded yet.

The new land deeds not only noted the landowner, area, dimensions, and location data but also included a scale plan drawn according to modern mapping methods. The deeds were in triplicate: one copy for the landowner, one for the Household Office archives, and one for the Grand Library archives.

After distributing the deeds, Wang Ruixiang announced that the remaining undeclared land would be confiscated as ownerless land.

"It's a pity to leave so much ownerless land fallow. However, the county has already recruited many refugees from Guangdong, so the ownerless land will be distributed to them for cultivation," Wang Ruixiang said nonchalantly. "Over a dozen households will come to your village. Everyone must get along well in the future."

It was known to everyone in Lingao that the Australians were transporting refugees from the mainland in ship after ship at Bopu. Now saying they would use the village's ownerless land to settle them—this was reasonable and logical, leaving the people present no choice but to believe it.

As soon as these words were spoken, all the villagers were stunned. Not only those who had concealed land, but even the tenant farmers were shocked—what a ruthless move!

"Alright, deeds have been collected. Everyone can disperse."

A buzz of discussion erupted in the yard.

"Chief! Have mercy!" A sharp woman's scream suddenly rang out. A woman from a landlord's family, hearing that all undeclared land would be confiscated and distributed to immigrants from the mainland, could no longer keep her cool. Disregarding whatever the head of the household might decide, in her desperation she lunged out of the crowd, crawled on the ground, and prostrated herself at Wang Ruixiang's feet.

"We lowly ones still have land we haven't declared—"

"Too late. The declaration period has ended." Wang Ruixiang said expressionlessly. "In another month, the immigrants from the mainland will arrive."

This caused an explosion of noise. Families in the courtyard who had initially tried to feign calm panicked completely. With a whoosh, they all knelt down, begging together.

Wang Ruixiang remained unmoved, ignoring how the families hiding land knelt on the ground, young and old, begging bitterly. He let the people on the ground cry, tear their clothes, and beat their chests. The family with the heaviest losses stood to lose almost half their land. Several elderly members and children fainted from crying.

"I told you many times: declare truthfully. Declared reclaimed land gets a deed; undeclared land gets treated as ownerless even if you have an old deed." Seeing the timing was about right, Wang Ruixiang feigned pity. "There's nothing to be done if you didn't listen. The mainland immigrants are coming soon, and now you say there's no land—you tell me, what should be done?"

"It was lard blinding our hearts. Please, Master, show mercy!" A dense crowd knelt before him; the leading old men had banged their heads until they bled.

"Stop pretending to be pitiful. If we hadn't measured it, you wouldn't be kneeling here begging for mercy," Wang Ruixiang sneered. "Maybe you'd be snickering at home right now, thinking you'd succeeded."

These words struck at the heart. The people kneeling below turned pale and couldn't speak.

Wang Ruixiang coughed: "If you dare to do it, you must dare to accept the consequences. Don't act like men without balls."

"We lowly ones will never dare again!" The people below continued to beg, their heads banging loudly against the stone floor. Several people's foreheads swelled up and bled.

Women in the crowd were crying and wailing. Many people on the threshing floor were watching, mostly ordinary farmers of the village. Seeing the village's rich people so wretched, they felt vindicated. Some smiled; others jeered from the sidelines.

Fu Buer also stood on the threshing floor, keeping a straight face and remaining silent. But he was secretly delighted: this move was the right one. That Australian who seemed rude but was actually shrewd had just praised him, calling him a "model," and made many promises—regardless of whether those promises would be fulfilled, at least all his land was preserved.

He stole a glance at Fu Yousan's eldest son, Fu Yizhuang, who was sweating profusely. Fu Yousan's family held back and didn't confess. They were confident that their farmstead's location was hidden and the Australians hadn't discovered it. But in such a scene, Fu Yizhuang had no confidence. The torment was unbearable. He secretly blamed his father, Fu Yousan: always coming up with ideas but making others take the lead, hiding himself whenever there was a confrontation.

"Fine," Wang Ruixiang said, seeing their heads were swollen from knocking and they were on the verge of collapse from crying and kowtowing. He finally relented. "Seeing how pitifully you beg, I'll give everyone a way out."

"Thank you, Chief—" They made to kowtow again.

"Don't thank me yet." Wang Ruixiang sneered. "If you expose anyone else in this village who hasn't honestly declared their land, I'll give you a chance for lenient punishment."

A moment of silence appeared in the courtyard. Everyone's gaze immediately turned to Fu Yizhuang: everyone in the village knew Fu Yousan's family had more land than this.

Wang Ruixiang's gaze followed. Fu Yizhuang felt like he had thorns in his back. His legs trembled, wanting to kneel and beg for mercy. He forced himself to calm down, comforting himself secretly: No matter how capable the Australians are, they don't have clairvoyance or wind-hearing ears. Even the villagers can't explain the farmstead's location clearly. What was there to fear? Even if someone wanted to inform, they had to be able to say where the land was.

"Fu Yousan's family has a lot of land." Finally, someone hiding in the crowd spoke in a low voice.

The people kneeling on the ground seemed to see a lifeline. They turned into vicious dogs, scrambling to jump up and tear at Fu Yousan's family. Men, women, and the elderly alike shouted vehemently: "Fu Yousan's family has undeclared land!"

These words immediately converged into a wave that crashed hard against Fu Yizhuang. Fu Yizhuang's face turned pale. Watching these people, who were just kneeling and begging for mercy, disregard kinship, clan ties, and neighborly relations to sell out his family instantly, he was so angry he almost vomited blood.

Forcing himself to stay calm, he saw Chief Wang's gaze turn toward him, so he bit the bullet and answered:

"My family's land has truly all been declared. There is no concealment."

"He's lying!" A woman screamed. "That old miser Fu Yousan is the best at hoarding wealth. His family has piles of grain they can't finish eating. He buys land every year; there must be other land!" Her words immediately drew a frenzy of agreement.

Wang Ruixiang waved his hand, signaling everyone to be quiet, and called him forward: "Does your family really have no more land?"

"Really, none." Fu Yizhuang decided to brazen it out to the end.

"None in other villages either?"

"My family has small holdings. We can't manage land bought in other villages."

"Don't you have brothers? Where are your brothers?" Wang Ruixiang asked.

Fu Yizhuang was startled. He didn't expect the Australians to know his family affairs so well. On second thought, Fu Buer must have told them.

"Erzhuang went to his wife's maiden home."

"Hmm." Wang Ruixiang stared at him for a long while. "Where's your father?"

"He—he's sick—"

"Sick again? He really knows how to get sick, and always at the right time." Wang Ruixiang said with a smile, then suddenly lowered his voice and said to him, "Don't you think so?"

"Yes—yes—" Fu Yizhuang was caught off guard.

"Your family has undeclared land." Wang Ruixiang spat on the ground. "You and your father must think we can't find that place, right?"

"Dare not, dare not." Fu Yizhuang was frightened into incoherence, his body trembling involuntarily.

"I'll tell you right now," Wang Ruixiang swept his gaze over the others, "nothing can be hidden from our eyes!" Saying this, he turned his gaze back to Fu Yizhuang's trembling body. "Go back and tell your father: we don't need to use torture on you. In three days, we'll know exactly how much land your family has. By then, your family will have to pay double."

Fu Yizhuang wanted to confess, but thinking that if he spoke, his father would never believe his explanation and it would be his fault again—he feared his father like a mouse fears a cat. Knowing the serious consequences, he still didn't dare disobey Fu Yousan's decision.

"Chief, I can't make decisions for the family." Fu Yizhuang was in turmoil, practically begging. "Please forgive me! Forgive me!"

"You're useless!" Wang Ruixiang felt contempt for him. "A man in his thirties, taking no responsibility for his own family affairs!"

Fu Yizhuang sulked internally: Dare I take responsibility in this family? Fu Yousan held everything in a death grip. Although he was the eldest son, he was ordered around like a head laborer at home. Of course, he couldn't say this, so he just lowered his head and remained silent, determined not to speak even if beaten to death.
