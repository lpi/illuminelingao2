# Chapter 550 - Gathering of Heroes

Wu Mu's suspicion of Yang Cao lessened considerably—a spy wouldn't torture herself to create so many scars years in advance, right?

But the calmness and decisiveness Yang Cao displayed increased his misgivings about her. He discussed his doubts with Zhao Manxiong. Zhao Manxiong asked, "Do you think she is reliable?"

"Reliable, but I worry—" Wu Mu hesitated, "I can't control her."

"You have full responsibility for the cadet squad," Zhao Manxiong said. "If you feel she's unusable, just expel her."

"But I feel it's a pity."

"I'm afraid I can't make this decision for you," Zhao Manxiong said. "You are a person in charge now; you must have the ability to make independent decisions. I will agree with whatever you decide."

Wu Mu returned to his office and thought for a long time. Finally, he called He Chun and Ke Yun separately and questioned them carefully about Yang Cao again. No further suspicious circumstances were found. In the end, he marked a check on Yang Cao's reflection paper, indicating she had passed.

Yao Yulan's "passing" was arduous. First, she had little resonance with *Test*, so naturally she couldn't show "sincere feelings." Second, her usual flamboyance caused much trouble. During political studies, classmates who resented her superiority took the opportunity to attack, rejecting her reflection several times. Yao Yulan had to rewrite it six times. Full of complaints, she thought about quitting, but felt it would be a loss after suffering so much. Finally, with Lu Cheng's help, she barely scraped through. Of course, after this, she became much more low-key in her conduct.

The deepening of political studies significantly increased the enthusiasm of the entire training class. Wu Mu now understood some of the secrets—that is, to keep cadets in a constant state of excitement. This excitement couldn't simply be filled with study courses, so he arranged many cultural and sports activities: exercising the body while leaving cadets no time for wild thoughts. In particular, a visit was arranged every week to let cadets fully experience the power of the transmigrated collective, establishing the belief that the collective was "invincible."

The cadets' professional studies deepened day by day. The short-term class aimed for speed, so it couldn't start from basics like the NCO training class. Zhao Manxiong invited many people to lecture: Ran Yao taught Political Security Overview; Mu Min taught Organization and Implementation of Political Security Work and Investigation Methods; Zhou Dongtian taught Interrogation Methods; Zhou Botao taught Secret Investigation; Liu Zheng taught Wilderness Survival Skills; Xue Ziliang taught Traceology and was responsible for team expansion training and combat instruction…

"The transmigrated collective is truly full of talent," Zhao Manxiong sighed. "A veritable gathering of heroes."

Because some were too specialized, Zhao Manxiong had to remind them repeatedly: the cadets were a group of indigenous people without even elementary education, and the enemy's level wouldn't be much higher. Teaching overly specialized knowledge and skills was not killing a chicken with a butcher's knife, but killing a chicken with a Gatling gun.

"Some knowledge and skills are too advanced; there's no need to let indigenous people master them too early," Zhao Manxiong said to Xue Ziliang and Salina. Among all instructors, these two had the most outstanding professional skills, generally representing international standards. Since Americans were relatively casual, Zhao Manxiong had to remind them specifically.

The cadets quickly learned how to establish secret work networks, conduct secret investigations, monitor organizations and individuals, observe undercurrents beneath surface calm, and conduct secret communications and contact…

Many courses used field exercises. Once, Zhou Botao took them to East Gate Market and let them move freely for three hours. Upon return, they were asked to recall details of East Gate Market as much as possible: street directions, number and location of shops, etc. Most were stunned on the spot. Many had wandered the entire market during those three hours but hadn't thought to note any details.

Most could only vaguely name the larger shops; many hadn't entered the smaller, more secluded side streets.

"Pay attention to details everywhere!" Zhou Botao reminded them. "Details will save your life!"

When escaping, knowing the surrounding terrain like the back of your hand prevents running into dead ends, allowing you to hide in secluded spots or blend into busy markets as the situation demands.

When pursuing or tracking, you can know which direction the target might flee and where you might intercept them.

To test if they maintained such observational powers at all times, sometimes they were sent to the streets for a specific internship task, only to be asked to recount different content upon return.

Once, Lu Cheng was ordered to conduct field observation on the activity patterns of small vendors in East Gate Market. But upon her return, Zhou Botao asked her to report how many prostitutes she saw waiting for customers in the market that day and identify them from photos on the table.

Lu Cheng had never expected such a question. She despised such shameless women who sold their bodies voluntarily and hadn't even looked at them.

"Why didn't you look at them?" Zhou Botao asked back. "You are a political security cadre. In this world, there are no people you like or dislike, only our own people and enemies. Those who oppose us are enemies; those willing to work honestly, make money, and pay taxes are our own. You must remember this at all times!"

They learned tracking and anti-tracking, conducting field training in markets, wilderness, forests, and mountainous areas. Zhou Botao taught the common ABC tracking method, involving three people tracking alternately.

"When tracking, two people follow behind the target, switching every so often to avoid detection," Zhou Botao pointed to the street sand table model on the desk. "The third person is on the opposite side of the street. If in the wild, on the opposite bank of a river or similar barrier, maintaining a parallel and slightly lagging position relative to the target."

"The third person's role is to prevent the target from suddenly changing position." Zhou Botao used a pointer to push the wooden piece symbolizing the target to the other side of the street. "If he suddenly crosses the street and there are many people and carts, you might not follow in time before he disappears into a side street."

Zhou Botao reminded them that the easiest place to lose a target during tracking or pursuit wasn't the desolate wilderness or secluded corners of a city—where people were scarce and movements easily exposed.

"The easiest place to be thrown off is a busy market, especially those with access in all directions. Once you lose the target's trace in such a place, it's very hard to find them again."

Cadets played roles of tracker and target, taking turns in confrontation. Losers were punished by cleaning up for the winners for several days.

Zhou Botao was particularly good at teaching tracking and had unique approaches to investigation. This made Mu Min curious. She knew Zhou Botao was a veteran who handled a pistol well, but he definitely wasn't from the public security system. And many techniques he used clearly had a "wild" feel.

"I was a private investigator," Zhou Botao explained. "Specializing in investigating extramarital affairs."

Private investigators excelled at surreptitious evidence collection, so Zhou Botao had his own unique methods for tracking and secret filming.

To improve every cadet's physical fitness, Chen Sigen was in charge of physical training. Chen Sigen was a professional fitness coach and a PhD in nutrition. His current title was "Director of the Nutrition and Fitness Office of the Ministry of Health," and he set the menus for both Senators and indigenous personnel.

Because the recruits were immigrants who had been in Lingao for six months, their nutritional status and physical fitness were much better than the average indigenous person of this timeline. But Chen Sigen felt this wasn't enough for future political security workers. Although secret police, like intelligence officers, spent most time doing office work, the transmigrated collective's manpower was tight, so there wouldn't be a detailed separation of internal and field staff. Every security cadre might have to do field work and take up arms to defend the regime when necessary. Their physical fitness directly affected work efficiency.

Chen Sigen decided to raise the food level of political security cadets to the same standard as the Army and Navy NCO classes.

"Is this too high?" Wu Mu hesitated. He was willing to feed his cadets better, but raising it to the highest level among indigenous cadets worried him about backlash from other departments.

"Have you ever fired a pistol?" Chen Sigen asked.

"A few times; there was organized training after D-Day." Wu Mu was a bit embarrassed. "I shot poorly."

"Do you know the physical requirements for pistol shooting?"

"What?" Wu Mu wondered what physical requirements a pistol needed.

"The most critical thing for pistol shooting is arm strength," Chen Sigen said. "The shooter must be able to easily complete 30 push-ups and a 5000-meter run to allow the pistol to be effective. And we're giving the indigenous cadets pistols made by our own machinery plant."

While improving the food, Chen Sigen began gradually training them physically, enhancing strength, coordination, and endurance. This was also physical preparation for the next step: teaching combat skills.

Regardless of the combat style or martial art, the basic requirement was that the user had sufficient strength. Attacks without strength were ineffective.

Chen Sigen excelled in free combat and was responsible for part of the combat coaching. But the main combat course was taught by Xue Ziliang, who taught Krav Maga, widely used by US law enforcement agencies.
