# Chapter 424 Late Summer

Summer gradually passed. The summer of 1629 saw Lingao County town become very quiet. For one thing, the weather was hot, and the townspeople didn't want to move about. The farmers were busy with the summer harvest and planting under the scorching sun, watering fields and weeding, with no time to come into town. For another, this city had been gradually marginalized economically. The already-few merchants in the city had gradually been attracted to the East Gate Market to open shops and do business. The common people and gentry had gradually grown accustomed to this new market. Whether buying things or strolling idly, the East Gate Market was far better than the county town in terms of goods available and shopping environment.

Several households of handicraft artisans in the city had all closed their businesses, including the only blacksmith shop in the county. Their products simply couldn't compete with those of the Transmigrators, and they even lost completely on price. They finally lost in the free competition. Now they were no longer in the county town. It was said they were working as craftsmen for the Short Hairs and the treatment was good. According to people who saw them, the cooper, who was originally so poor he had nothing, had actually gotten himself a wife, brought in four or five apprentices, and was making barrels day and night.

The only place in the city that still seemed somewhat lively was the Runshitang pharmacy. Since the owner of Runshitang went to the Mainland, the previously quiet and tranquil Runshitang suddenly became busy, with many outside apothecaries added to work. Basket after basket of medicinal herbs were carried in, and box after box of finished medicines were carried out. Everyone said that Yang Shixiang, the owner of Runshitang, had struck it rich this time. Once every ten days, several large carts of goods would be transported to Bopu, loaded with Runshitang's newly manufactured Zhuge Marching Powder and Epidemic-Avoiding Powder—said to be selling well in the Guangzhou area. These two medicines were also very well received in Lingao. Especially the cheap and excellent Epidemic-Avoiding Powder; many people carried a bottle on them, making it a regular summer safety medicine. Even those who really couldn't afford it could get some at the church gate of the East Gate Market—the price was listening to the foreign monks inside recite a passage of scripture.

The foreign monks were friendly, the stories they told were quite appealing, and they would bring out nice picture books. Even if not for the medicine, it was a good choice for entertainment.

Those in the know said that the reason Runshitang could turn its fortunes around was because Boss Yang had connected with a "Divine Doctor" among the Short Hairs. The medicine formulas were provided by him. It was said he also received financial support.

These Australians were really like the boy attendant of the God of Wealth. The people in the county with active minds all had this feeling. Take Lin Quan'an, who opened the Quanfu Trading Company—he was originally just a Fujianese peddler carrying goods with a shoulder pole. Now he had become a great wealthy man in the county, going about in a four-man sedan chair, running all over the prefecture. And now there was Yang Shixiang... Many people's minds started to become active. Some were asking around about what methods they could use to connect with someone in the Crossing Group.

The County Yamen, the central authority of Lingao, was also listless throughout the summer. The main gate was tightly closed, and the two yamen runners guarding the gate were hiding in the gate passage to cool off. It was now time to collect summer grain, but the clerks, petty officials, and "grain tax collectors" who usually paraded their might and power at the yamen gate every autumn were nowhere to be seen—the local summer grain quota was merely 32 *shi*. Even doubling the levy wouldn't yield much profit, so naturally no one was eager.

The major and minor officials of the county sensed something from the stagnant air of the city and felt uneasy, but what exactly made them uneasy, no one could say clearly.

What was there to be dissatisfied about now? The bandits had been basically cleared out; large-scale pirate landings and robberies had completely disappeared. Just these two things, in the eyes of Wu Mingjin and others, were already remarkable achievements. As for the road that kept extending past the city gate, that was a beneficial policy he had thought about for years but couldn't accomplish.

Personally speaking, everyone was doing well. From Wu Mingjin at the top to the ordinary petty officials in the yamen, each received a sum of "Circulation Vouchers" from the Short Hairs every month according to a grade table—although it wasn't gleaming silver, it could be spent in the East Gate Market. Wu Mingjin had originally looked down on this "counterfeit money," but ever since he became fond of cigarettes—that thing with a mellow, non-pungent taste that was very convenient to smoke—this "counterfeit money" showed great value. The shops selling cigarettes in the East Gate Market only accepted this kind of money.

And his wife and children, whom he had brought back from Qiongshan, loved Australian goods far more than he did. First, his wife couldn't put down the glass mirror. Second, ever since Xiong Buyou sent a pair of porcelain bottled Tianchu "Secret Recipe MSG," the kitchen couldn't do without it when cooking. Subsequently, various Tianchu pickles were sent over, which for Mrs. Wu, a guest sojourner in this wild and barbarous land, was like rain after a long drought—Wu Mingjin was from Nanzhili and had a natural fondness for pickles and marinated eggs. Although these were common and cheap in Nanzhili, in Lingao they were rare items. Wu Mingjin ate a few slices of "Yangzhou Pickled Cucumber" and felt that although the taste wasn't quite right, the flavor was roughly similar, giving rise to a bout of nostalgia. He even wrote a few poems on the spur of the moment. In a surge of elegance, he sent someone to invite Secretary Wang to come compose poems together, only to be told that Secretary Wang had gone out with his newly taken concubine. Wu Mingjin was quite disappointed.

However, the Short Hairs were very sly. Although they often sent things, they wouldn't repeat items. When the MSG, pickles, and marinated eggs ran out, he waited eagerly for Xiong Buyou to send more, but there was no trace of him. To buy them, one had to go to the East Gate Market. Wu Mingjin had to cut a portion of his cigarette money to give to his wife for expenses.

As Xiong Buyou sent gifts more and more frequently, Wu Mingjin found his money for buying cigarettes becoming increasingly tight. His solution was to have his servant take the brown rice that the court gave him as salary to the East Gate Market to exchange for Circulation Vouchers. This practice seemed unbelievable even to himself. But Circulation Vouchers really were good things.

However, the prices of "Australian goods" were too high! He had been smoking "Holy Ship" brand cigarettes: ten white cigarettes, each with a small bamboo tube mouthpiece attached, with a ship pattern on the box—Wu Mingjin knew this was the giant ship in Bopu. The price of Holy Ship was 6 Yuan per pack. According to the Delong Grain Shop's price list, it was equivalent to about four or five *jin* of brown rice!

A tiny cigarette lit was half a *jin* of rice! Wu Mingjin felt he was really too extravagant, so he instructed the servant to buy cheaper ones. The servant bought a brand called "Bairen Beach." The taste was about the same, just without the bamboo tube mouthpiece. The packaging was also much simpler. The price was only 3 Yuan. After smoking for a few days, he discovered that the clerks in the county yamen smoked this kind too. Looking more closely, it turned out that cigarettes came in different grades. The most expensive was "Holy Ship," followed by "Bairen Beach," then there was "Gaoshan Ridge" at 1 Yuan, and finally "Big Production" at only 50 *fen*. Peddlers and laborers smoked this kind.

As the highest official in the county, it was really unseemly for Wu Mingjin to smoke the same grade of cigarettes as the yamen clerks. So he had to continue smoking "Holy Ship."

Recently, the East Gate Market had started selling ice blocks—this caused a huge sensation. Everyone in Lingao wanted to know where the Short Hairs' ice came from. Lingao's winters didn't freeze, and there were no deep mountains locally where snow could be stored as ice. The Short Hairs not only seemed to have ice, but it also seemed to come very easily. They had enough for their own use and could still sell it. A big block could be bought for 10 *fen* in Circulation Vouchers.

A big block of ice placed in the hall immediately made it feel much cooler. Using ice to chill fruits was even better. Xiong Buyou also had someone send a few small jars of sour plum syrup—drinking a bowl of iced sour plum soup was a fine thing—only it further expanded Wu Mingjin's Circulation Voucher expenditure.

County Magistrate Wu quite cleverly perceived that this was the Crossing Group using all kinds of "clever tricks" of material enjoyment to lure him and his whole family. They didn't send real gold and silver; they sent things to enjoy. And these things were only available from the Short Hairs.

Wu Mingjin sneered to himself: *Do you think I don't know your tricks!*

Knowing was one thing, but the demand was irresistible. As the saying goes, "It's easy to go from frugal to extravagant, but hard to go from extravagant to frugal." Once a person got used to life's enjoyments, changing again became very difficult. For example, his attempt to go back to smoking a dry pipe had failed. It was spicy and bitter, and just dripped tobacco tar. After a few puffs, he flew into a rage and flung the pipe away, scaring the attendant into kneeling on the ground, not daring to make a sound. In the end, cigarettes were bought from the East Gate Market to settle the matter.

As for ice blocks, even if he could endure it, his wife and children couldn't understand his difficulties and simply had to have it. His son even suggested: send someone to ask the Australians to deliver some ice every day—presumably they wouldn't refuse. This made Wu Mingjin so angry he just wanted to slap him a few times.

Buying ice himself was of course possible, but the cigarette money kept shrinking... The problem of insufficient cigarette money, often encountered by modern men, Wu Mingjin also encountered.

Money—he naturally had some. Though Lingao was a remote and small county, the county magistrate's share of the summer and autumn levies was there as expected. But the silver saved in the past had already been sent back to his hometown. The summer levies had little profit, and the autumn levies hadn't arrived yet. For the time being, apart from the pitiful monthly salary, there was nowhere to get money—Wu Mingjin considered himself a "conscientious" county official. Taking ill-gotten money and being corrupt, those were things he generally wouldn't do.

Of course, as long as he gave a hint and grumbled to Wu Ya about his hardships, the Short Hairs would probably take the initiative to raise his "allowance." But County Magistrate Wu, besides being "conscientious," also had a bit of "backbone"—he absolutely wouldn't do something akin to "begging."

Unexpectedly, a few days later, Xiong Buyou very considerately sent over a stack of ice tickets. Each ticket was good for one block of ice at the East Gate Market, one block per ticket. Thirty blocks per month. Wu Mingjin's emotions were very complex: the Australians' bribery—he didn't have the courage to refuse, but accepting it—he felt he was sinking deeper and deeper. Not just himself, but also all the high and low officials in the county.
