# Chapter 499 - Blackmail

Among these people, the one he valued most was Ma Benyuan, who served as a secretary in the Hainan Branch Surveillance Commissioner's Yamen. This man was a local Hainan Muslim and a key figure in the Gou family's Qiongzhou-Guangzhou stolen goods disposal route. A large quantity of stolen goods looted by pirates like Zhu Cailao had mostly been sold through his handling. There was a lot of correspondence between Gou Da, Gou Er, and him. Various blackmail materials were enough to get him beheaded ten times over. Lin Baiguang felt he held enough leverage to force him into submission.

Lin Baiguang didn't value the disposal route Ma Benyuan controlled; Lingao's trade routes were already basically open. Adding another one was just icing on the cake. What he valued was Ma the Advisor's position in the Branch Surveillance Commissioner's Yamen. With such an insider, the transmigrator group could know every move of Hainan's highest authorities in advance.

Lin Baiguang knew that if he went directly to request a meeting with Ma Benyuan, he would never see him. Such people were extremely suspicious and never easily met unknown outsiders. So he presented an Eight Treasures silver statue of the God of Longevity, originally sent by Ma Benyuan as a birthday gift and seized from Gou Er's house, as a gift.

This unexpected gift gave Ma Benyuan a fright—this was a gift he had given to Gou Er; how did it suddenly appear before him? Since Gou Er fled to Qiongshan in a sorry state last year, crying that his farmstead had been destroyed, he hadn't seen him for almost a year.

Back then, he had unceremoniously driven Gou Er away, not even giving him the three thousand taels of silver for fencing stolen goods. It wasn't that he wanted to embezzle this money. He was the one who had connected the Gou family with Zhu Cailao, acting as half a guarantor. Now that this nest owner had been wiped out with nothing left, if Zhu Cailao took his anger out on him and came to demand an explanation, he couldn't afford the consequences. This silver could at least calm Chief Zhu's anger a little.

After driving Gou Er away, Ma Benyuan had been living in fear. He counted as a figure in Qiongshan County, but in front of a pirate lord like Zhu Cailao, he wasn't even a fart.

Fortunately, Zhu Cailao had troubles himself. Besides sending people a few times to ask about Gou Er's whereabouts, he didn't trouble him. However, he also learned from the people sent by Zhu Cailao that the ones who destroyed the Gou Family Farmstead were a new force from the sea. They called themselves Australians, came in iron ships, and had very powerful firearms. Ma Benyuan secretly complained; neither the Australians nor Chief Zhu seemed like benevolent types.

Recently he learned that Chief Zhu had died in battle in Fujian. This relieved Ma Benyuan. For the past half year or more, Zhu Cailao's subordinates had been looking for Gou Er everywhere. He was deeply afraid that one day, unable to find Gou Er, they would come to vent their anger on him.

Now that this God of Longevity appeared before his eyes, could it be that Gou Er also knew of Zhu Cailao's death, so he came to demand the silver for the stolen goods?

Ma Benyuan pondered whether to embezzle this silver and avoid seeing him. Anyway, Gou Er was now a stray dog with no strength left except for a son. If he dared to make trouble in Qiongshan County, he could crush him with one finger.

To be prudent, he asked: "Is the visitor Gou Er?"

The gatekeeper servant was his confidant and naturally knew all the master's cronies.

Upon inquiry, the visitor was not Gou Er, nor his son, but a stranger he didn't know, speaking with a strange Qiongzhou accent. While Ma Benyuan was rubbing his chin in suspicion, he suddenly shuddered:

*Could it be the Australians?!*

This thought almost scared him off his chair. He wondered what the Australians wanted with him. He had no dealings with the Australians, nor any grievances.

But this silver God of Longevity—Ma Benyuan knew very clearly that when Gou Er fled from the farmstead, he would only take valuables like gold and silver. He absolutely wouldn't run with such a gift item. This object could only have fallen into Australian hands.

What business did the Australians have coming to his door? Ma Benyuan wanted to refuse the meeting, but thinking that since the Australians had come to his door, they naturally came prepared—they even found the silver God of Longevity he gave to Gou Er—he should meet them to see the situation.

"This student is unacquainted with your distinguished self. I wonder why your great self has honored me with a visit and for what matter?" Ma Benyuan, seeing the visitor was young, possessed a steady temperament, and looked quite shrewd, couldn't figure out his background for a moment, so he asked very politely.

"My surname is Lin, coming from Lingao." Lin Baiguang smiled. Since he wanted to recruit him to serve the transmigrator group, there was no need to hide.

Ma Benyuan's heart skipped a beat. So it really was them!

He said cautiously: "Your distinguished self is an Australian, right?"

Lin Baiguang nodded: "Exactly." Saying so, he handed over a thin stack of papers.

This was a copy of "The Ledger," compiled from materials seized from the Gou brothers. It clearly recorded Ma Benyuan's accounts for fencing stolen goods for pirate chiefs like Zhu Cailao. Dates, quantities, all clear. And the last entry clearly stated that three thousand taels of silver for Zhu Cailao's goods had not been settled.

Seeing this copy, Ma Benyuan immediately slumped into his chair like a deflated ball. After a long while, he said:

"This student indeed had business dealings with the Gou brothers, but merely sold some goods on their behalf," he waved his hand weakly. "I truly didn't know the goods were stolen items from Zhu Cailao and others..."

"Mr. Ma," Lin Baiguang smiled broadly, "I am not the government. I don't care about such things."

"Yes, yes, much obliged." Ma Benyuan said. With his experience, he naturally knew the other party was about to start negotiations. "I wonder what your distinguished group needs this student to do?"

"Just want to continue partnering with Mr. Ma." Lin Baiguang knew the matter was mostly done. He smiled, "To scheme great plans together." Lin Baiguang thought this Ma Benyuan was a smart man; he held enough cards to force him to submit, no need for twists and turns. He promptly stated his requirements one by one. Ma Benyuan's initially calm face turned uglier the more he listened. Only after a long while did he reply: "This is too difficult."

Lin Baiguang said: "Sir just needs to pass on the things heard and seen in the yamen to us. We naturally have someone to contact you."

Ma Benyuan still hesitated and shook his head. This kind of business was equivalent to being a spy for the Australians. Informing for others in the yamen wasn't a big deal, but he knew somewhat about the Australian's conduct: this group built cities and roads in Lingao, recruited renegades, and would cause big trouble sooner or later! If he was found spying for them, it would be a capital crime!

But Lin Baiguang's threat was also truly terrifying—especially this ledger, which had too much killing power. Zhu Cailao had just been exterminated, and the government's zeal for clearing out pirates hadn't passed yet. If this thing was thrown out, even if he didn't die, he would lose a layer of skin. Seeing his determination waver, Lin Baiguang told him again that he could keep the three thousand taels of silver, and he could continue fencing stolen goods for pirates in the future, with the transmigrator group paying the commission as usual.

This tempting condition made Ma Benyuan finally agree. In fact, he couldn't refuse. Agreeing meant at least getting silver every year; refusing meant this ledger and the letters in their hands would be his death warrant! As for how to be a spy, that was a matter for the future.

Seeing he agreed, Lin Baiguang told him the contact method: Under normal circumstances, on a certain day every month, he would send someone to contact him at a teahouse on the main street outside the West Gate.

"You just sit there; someone will naturally contact you." Lin Baiguang whispered, "The person coming to contact you will carry a water pipe with a green jade mouthpiece. Whatever news there is in the yamen or inside and outside the city, you just tell him."

This wasn't difficult. Ma Benyuan thought.

"If there's any news we want to know, he will tell you." Lin Baiguang said.

Ma Benyuan nodded.

"If you ever need to meet our people urgently, go to the Five Officials Temple and drop a broken straw shoe by the stone steps outside the main gate. Then wait at the teahouse; someone will naturally come to meet you."

A chill rose in Ma Benyuan's heart. Not because the method was brilliantly unexpected, but because being able to do this meant the Australians had already placed many personnel in the prefectural city. Maybe there were Australian spies staring at his house right outside.

"Sometimes we will look for you urgently. We will draw a circle on the wall outside your gate. When you see it, go to the teahouse; someone will contact you."

Lin Baiguang spoke logically. In fact, he didn't have a single person in Qiongzhou Prefecture. The so-called Qiongzhou Station was still up in the air. But this speech served the purpose of intimidating Ma Benyuan.

After conveniently recruiting Ma Benyuan, Lin Baiguang's visits lasted for a few more days. No one on his list dared refuse his request—the killing power of blackmail material was very effective. This group wasn't very reliable; they only served the transmigrator group because they were forced. Lin Baiguang only used them as sources of intelligence; real intelligence work still had to be done by intelligence personnel sent from Lingao.

He had one worry, and that was the Brocade Guard personnel in Qiongzhou Prefecture. According to custom, there were dispatched agencies of the Brocade Guard in the prefectural city, with officers like Hundred-Household, Trial Hundred-Household, General Banner, and Small Banner. Influenced by movies and TV, ordinary people naturally feared secret service agencies like the Great Ming's Brocade Guard, Eastern Depot, and Western Depot. Lin Baiguang was no exception.

However, there were no Brocade Guard personnel names in the Gou family's relationship network. This made him a bit strange. The black businesses like harboring stolen goods, fencing, and smuggling salt that the Gou family engaged in were extremely lucrative. For an agency as powerful as the Brocade Guard, which usually looked for trouble to get silver even when there was nothing wrong, it was impossible not to come for a share.

In the bribery ledger seized from Gou Er's chest, the names of Qiongzhou Prefecture's Brocade Guard Hundred-Household and Trial Hundred-Household were only listed in the gift ledger for the Three Festivals and Two Birthdays. Their names were instead absent from the ledgers containing large bribes.
