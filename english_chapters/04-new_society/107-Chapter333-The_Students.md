# Chapter 333 - The Students

"I think they are preparing to press oil. Coconut Oil Poached Fish."

"Just hearing that makes me want to vomit," Shi Niaoren said. "But most likely they're preparing to make soap."

"They won't be making soap on a large scale anymore," Jiang Qiuyan said. "This expedition discovered a large amount of *Gleditsia* (honey locust) resources. I estimate everyone will be using *Gleditsia* pods for a long time."

"Does *Gleditsia* have sterilizing effects for hand washing?"

"I don't know, probably."

Saying this, he took out several thick, crumpled notebooks encrusted with salt grains from his portable box. They contained medical records, health diaries, and disease conditions written along the journey.

"Everyone organize these things together when you have time. I'm a psychiatrist after all; doing this is a bit unfamiliar to me."

Fu Wuben was taken to Boys' Dormitory No. 1—besides gender segregation, the quarantine camp was now also segregated by age. Orphans and single men were no longer put together. The reason was that incidents of adults snatching children's food and even sodomy had occurred in the Bopu quarantine camp. Although the perpetrators paid a painful price—sentenced to life imprisonment at hard labor in the labor reform team—the transmigrators still decided to separate adults and children to prevent such scandals from continuing.

Dormitory No. 1 was where children who entered during the same period stayed. Less than ten people lived on the thirty bunk beds. The room was empty; a few children were sitting by the bedside reading aloud, while a few others were fighting and playing with each other. Like him, they were all bald and wearing tight-fitting blue cloth jackets with standing collars.

The beds were covered with straw mats, clean and tidy, with a folded single quilt made of blue cloth similar in color and material to their uniforms. There was a simple sedge pillow. Besides these, there was a small cabinet made of unpainted white wood by the bed.

Fu Wuben knew the rules of being a newcomer; after entering, he stood properly first to see if a "boss" would come out to assign a bunk. But after waiting for a long time, no one spoke, so he carefully chose a bunk that looked unoccupied and put down the luggage he had just received.

"Hey!" someone shouted. Fu Wuben was startled, hurriedly picked up his things again, and stood blankly by the bed.

A boy ran over. "Newcomer! You can't put luggage directly on the bed! If Teacher Bai sees it, you'll get beaten."

"Then where should I put it?" Fu Wuben asked, then added ingratiatingly, "Senior Brother."

"Senior Brother?" The boy was stunned, then laughed. "I'm not your Senior Brother, I'm called Lu Jia! I'm from Xuankuodu!" Mentioning he was from Xuankuodu, he seemed to puff out his chest proudly.

Xuankuodu meant people from the county seat, the so-called "city folk." The sense of superiority of being a "city person" was also very common in ancient times.

"Isn't your family just tenant farmers planting school fields? Barbarians living by the city gate." Several boys nearby immediately chimed in. "What's there to be arrogant about?"

"My family are official tenants..."

"So what if official tenants? Still poor enough to show your butt."

"I am from XX Village." Fu Wuben carefully didn't join this conversation about the truth.

"Heard about it! A lot of people from your place arrived recently," Lu Jia said. "The rules here are strict; things must be arranged neatly and not placed randomly."

"I'm from Thirteen Villages!" A boy ran over. "My name is Yuan... Yuan..." He finally remembered his newly acquired official name: "Yuan Fei!"

"You guys from Thirteen Villages are all bandit spawn!" Before the two could narrate their hometown friendship, a discordant voice came from another corner of the room. This was an older-looking boy. A large scar on his forehead made him look very ferocious.

"You're talking nonsense!" Yuan Fei screamed angrily. "My dad isn't a bandit!"

"Your grandpa was a bandit, your whole family, whole village are bandits!" The scarred boy shouted, unwilling to show weakness. The two glared at each other, looking like they would fight immediately and eat each other alive. Fu Wuben was scared into hiding backward.

"This is Wu Xiang," Lu Jia whispered. "Heard his family was harmed by Dang Namen's gang. So now he's like a psycho. Whoever says they are from Thirteen Villages, he immediately acts like they are irreconcilable enemies."

"Will he hit people—" Fu Wuben thought, *I am also from the Thirteen Villages area; getting beaten for no reason isn't worth it.*

"Don't worry, he dares not. Last time he fought with Yuan Fei and got dragged out and whipped thoroughly; now he only dares to roar," Lu Jia said nonchalantly. "If he causes trouble again, he'll be taken to the labor reform team."

Sure enough, the two people's glaring contest ended after killing each other with eyes for a few minutes. Yuan Fei said, "Great, now that you're here, we from Thirteen Villages don't have to take that psycho's useless anger anymore."

"You'd better save it," Lu Jia said. "The Australian Chiefs strictly forbid forming factions based on hometowns or clans. Watch out for the rattan cane!"

"I am not a bandit family member!" Yuan Fei looked aggrieved. "Bandit children are all locked in a separate camp over by the church! Heard they want them to be foreign monks!"

"Why make them be monks?" Fu Wuben asked strangely.

"Who knows," Lu Jia said. "Organize your things first."

Fu Wuben opened the bag he received. There were many things inside: a set of clothes identical to what he was wearing, a cap with a brim, two sets of underwear, socks—the underwear and socks were very soft and had no stitching lines, surprising him greatly. These were products made by Bairen Textile Mill using primitive knitting machines.

Then there were two long towels, one white and one blue. Thick and soft, covered in loops. Lu Jia told him, "This is called a *maojin* (towel). White for washing face, blue for bathing." Fu Wuben had never used a face towel growing up, and now hearing he had to use two, he instantly wondered if he had come to the wrong place—even landlord grain households weren't this particular.

He knew the wooden toothbrush was for brushing teeth; landlords in his village used them. They looked similar. Of course, he himself never used one.

A bamboo tube cup for drinking and rinsing mouth, plus a big bowl, chopsticks, and spoon for eating.

"Master thought so thoughtfully."

"Everyone is like this, nothing rare." Lu Jia put on an old-timer "I know everything" appearance. Then he taught him to categorize and place things in stipulated places: clothes must be folded neatly in the cabinet, towels must be hung unfolded, even the direction chopsticks were placed had rules.

"Australians hate messiness the most. Everything has rules, even shitting!" Lu Jia described exaggeratedly. "And they are very afraid of dirt, bathing every day! Those who violate rules will be dragged out to have their buttocks beaten." Saying this he shivered, probably remembering the feeling of getting beaten. "Whipped with rattan canes." Saying this he subconsciously touched his butt.

Just as they were talking, Fu Wuben's stomach suddenly felt a burst of cramping pain.

"Can't hold it! Where is the latrine?"

"Run left after exit, there is a house with two doors." Before Lu Jia finished, Fu Wuben was about to run.

"Don't run, take toilet paper!" Lu Jia gave him toilet paper. Fu Wuben ran wildly without saying a word.

When Fu Wuben returned to the dormitory, his legs could hardly walk; his stomach was churning violently. After he came out, the older child on duty outside made him wash his hands, and he had to rub a piece of slippery stuff on his hands until foam appeared before washing it clean.

Fu Wuben's diarrhea would continue for two days until the effects of the deworming medicine wore off.

Everyone talked for a while longer. It turned out everyone's background was different. Lu Jia was an apprentice recruited by Wu Nanhai.

"That day Master Wu walked around the fields with the County Director of Education and took me in." He said triumphantly, "He even said I was something 'teachable'?"

Yuan Fei was recruited together when Du Wen took in orphans in the Thirteen Villages area—he wasn't really an orphan, but hearing that children going to Bairen could get free food and clothing and learn to read, many families feeling burdened by large populations sent their children over, and the Work Team accepted them all.

As for that Wu Xiang, he ran to East Gate Market himself, asking to defect to freedom—origins varied.

There were two types of children here: "Sponsored Students"—sent or adopted by transmigrators personally, relevant upbringing costs deducted from their own income, taken back by "Masters" for self-education after simple basic literacy and military training; "State Students"—children collected from various channels, raised and educated uniformly by the Ministry of Education, then sent to various places according to learning conditions.

Just as they were talking, shouting came from outside: "Attention! Officer inspection." With this long shout, the children in the room hurriedly put down things in their hands and all stood by their beds, standing straight.

"Stand properly, quick!" Lu Jia reminded him. Fu Wuben imitated his appearance, standing stiffly straight.

The person who came was an officer wearing an Army uniform—during the quarantine period, conducting basic military training for everyone to strengthen their organization, discipline, and obedience was a unanimous resolution of the Executive Committee. So it was stipulated that Army and Navy officers take turns serving as instructors for the quarantine camp. The person coming was exactly Zhang Berlin.

Standing closest to the door, Lu Jia saw Zhang Berlin enter and shouted: "Attention!"

Zhang Berlin scanned the entire room and returned a salute.

"Report to Sir! Dormitory No. 1 has twelve actual persons, twelve persons present! Please instruct."

Zhang Berlin waved his hand, walked along the aisle between beds, looking at every bed and the cabinet beside it, occasionally wiping the furniture with a hand wearing a white glove to see if there was dust. When he made this move, a child was sweating cold sweat on his forehead.

Finally, he expressed satisfaction with the hygiene and order situation here and walked out. Then the shout from the next dormitory was heard.

Fu Wuben broke out in a cold sweat. Lu Jia said proudly, "See how big the rules are here? There are dormitory regulations on the wall; you'd better memorize them."

"I can't read," Fu Wuben said embarrassedly.
