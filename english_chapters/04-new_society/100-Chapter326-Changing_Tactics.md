# Chapter 326 - Changing Tactics

"Xin Nachun is Xin Nari's younger sister. This girl is something else; she has a fiery temper and dares to kill pigs herself. Ordinary young men aren't enough for her to look at."

"Mm," Liu Si said in a low voice, "Tell me everything about the village and the people properly."

"Why do you want to know these things?" Widow Zhou spat, her almond eyes full of spring. "Going to suck up to those two female officials again, right? A big man, listening to the orders of two women, shame on you!"

"They are Chiefs; they pay my salary. Even officials have to kneel when they see the Empress Dowager. Besides, those two broads are tall and strong, like big horses. How could your Fourth Brother look at them—" Liu Si pulled the woman into his arms, reached his hand in from her waist, rubbed up and down, and put his mouth close to her ear, whispering, "Good wife, tell Fourth Brother everything about the village properly, and I won't let you lack comfort tonight..."

Liu Si's selfishness and "using public office for private gain" actually made him the person who grasped the most data in the team. From Widow Zhou, he learned a lot about the village, especially the recent movements of bandit family members. This was extremely important news. He dared not neglect it, and after returning from Widow Zhou's house that night, he reported everything he heard from Widow Zhou to them in full detail.

"It seems this gang of bandits is still lingering like a ghost," said Dong Weiwei.

Du Wen gnashed her teeth: "It seems we need severe suppression!" She thought for a moment, "Are the households making trouble behind the scenes landlords or rich peasants?"

"Landlords, rich peasants?" Liu Si was stunned. He had learned basic knowledge about social class division in the Peasant Movement Institute. But he didn't expect such a question and hesitated: "Not really—"

Dong Weiwei was dissatisfied with her background theory: "Whatever landlords or poor peasants, let Liu Si speak business first!" She turned to ask him: "What is the common people's attitude towards us now? Bandit families are still so rampant; why is everyone unwilling to organize village braves for self-defense?"

"The common folks in the village have Three Fears," Liu Si said. "First, they fear the work team settling accounts on the issue of 'following bandits'."

The Thirteen Villages area used to be the bandits' old nest. Few ordinary families didn't have entanglements with bandits; at the very least, they had supplied grain and fodder, not to mention those who followed to fish for benefits. If investigated, they could all be considered "collaborating with bandits"; even if they didn't die, they'd lose a layer of skin.

Second was the fear of bandit retaliation once they made a comeback. Some people who intended to get close to the work team were afraid that if the work team ran away and the bandits returned, the retaliation would be very ferocious. Many people still had lingering fears about the massacre in the village after Dang Namen started his bandit gang years ago—almost all families who had grudges against him in the past had people killed, and some were simply exterminated. Some families had to flee entirely.

"Third is the fear of going to war." Liu Si summarized in substandard Mandarin, "Afraid that after establishing village braves, they will be transferred out to fight bandits."

Dong Weiwei said: "I remember when the Security Corps was formed a few months ago, the Thirteen Villages area should have also provided men. I don't seem to recall hearing about people here fearing war."

"They did send men. I heard from villagers that Dang Namen said at the time that the... Baldies... were not to be trifled with, so just deal with it by sending a few. Each village sent a few bachelors and outsiders."

"I didn't expect them to be so cowardly. If they are afraid of fighting bandits, what's the use of building village braves?" Du Wen was somewhat discouraged.

"You can't say that. They were beaten and killed into fear by bandits." Dong Weiwei said, "Since there are Three Fears, we must first make them not afraid. Only with courage will they dare to do things."

"If Xin Nari isn't caught and beheaded for public display, the hearts of the people in this village won't be settled. Our attempt to build a militia to control Thirteen Villages won't be realized."

However, the news from the daily scheduled radio contact was not very encouraging—Xin Nari was still nowhere to be found, and no bandit suppression detachment reported capturing or killing Xin Nari.

The intelligence collected by other cadets was similar. Mentioning the attitudes of various people, most were indifferent. The few people won over by the cadets only provided some basic information. In summary, under the calm surface of this village was a surging undercurrent. The destruction of the Dang Namen bandit gang was like throwing a stone here: bandit families whose relatives were killed wanted revenge, and families persecuted by bandits in the past also thought of taking this opportunity to avenge their grievances. Hatred was fermenting in this small village. A fierce storm was imminent, but Du Wen and Dong Weiwei had seriously underestimated the severity of the situation they faced.

After Liu Si left, the two women started a new round of arguments—this time about whether to arrest bandit families: Du Wen demanded to send people immediately to arrest all bandit families to "knock out the prestige of bandit families." Dong Weiwei disagreed, believing that arresting people based merely on a few words investigated by Liu Si was too credulous.

"Besides, arrest the whole family, or just the men? What do we do after arresting them?" Dong Weiwei asked back.

Du Wen thought it was true; arresting was easy, but dealing with them after arresting...

"Hold a mass struggle meeting!" She finally found a trick from land reform again.

"Not necessarily useful." Dong Weiwei shook her head repeatedly. "It's easy for you to arrest bandit families. But are the victims' families willing to come out and struggle against them? The soy-sauce-buying (bystander) masses are the majority here, and they still have scruples about the scattered bandits outside. They may not necessarily be mobilized."

"What do you say we do?"

"Let's wait and see." Dong Weiwei couldn't come up with any clever plan either. "It would be great if we could catch Xin Nari and bring him back here for a public trial."

"Isn't that the same as saying nothing?" Du Wen felt anxious.

"Anyway, it's better to find out the details first." Dong Weiwei rolled her eyes. "We can use the foreigner in the back."

"Use the foreigner for what?" Du Wen instinctively disliked that guy.

"It's fine, make him serve our purpose." Dong Weiwei said, "The foreigner isn't one of us. Although no one listens to his stuff, it's more convenient for him to move around than us. Asking him to help collect intelligence in the village and do some propaganda is quite useful."

Although Du Wen thought it was unreliable, since the failure of the mass meeting, she had some doubts about her consistent correctness. So she didn't insist. She immediately sent someone to call Bai Duolu.

Bai Duolu came from the back with a mournful face—since arriving in Daolu Village, he had practically become Lu Ruohua's manservant. He also had to help print propaganda materials: before leaving, Lu Ruohua asked him to write a few missionary pieces, paid Zhou Dongtian's printing shop to carve a few woodblocks, and carried them tirelessly to the village.

When he was called to the second courtyard, his hands were covered in black ink, and he was wiping them with paper—he felt quite heartbroken because the propaganda materials he worked so hard to print had recently appeared frequently in various daily uses in the village; he could even often see them in the latrine.

Bai Duolu thought about it and agreed; moreover, this was the only way to open up the situation right now.

"Okay, I'll go talk to Father Lu." After speaking, he felt he was simply sinning heavily—wondering if he should go for confession and penance.

Bai Duolu returned to the room and saw Lu Ruohua still working hard under an oil lamp, writing something with a locally made quill pen, probably writing some sermon again.

"Father—" He interrupted the diligent Frenchman. "I have something to say..."

"What is it, my child?" Lu Ruohua had a look of extraordinary modesty.

"Should we change our methods?"

"Oh," Father Lu was obviously interested in this question. "You are finally willing to discuss this issue with me."

"Yes, Father." Bai Duolu said, "I have some ideas."

"Please speak, my child."

"I think there is no need to print and distribute things like leaflets anymore. Most people here are illiterate and can't read at all. No matter how many you print, they just use them as daily paper... I think you have seen this problem too, Father."

"Yes." Lu Ruohua nodded.

"You know, the objects you face are Chinese. And I am also Chinese. So I know Chinese people's thoughts." Bai Duolu said, "You know, Chinese people are essentially a realistic nation..."

Bai Duolu began to expound to him what Dong Weiwei had said—actually, these things were not strange to Bai Duolu either.

He talked a lot, and Lu Ruohua remained silent. Finally, he opened his mouth: "My child, the Bible says..."

"Father," Bai Duolu said very humbly, "..."

Lu Ruohua nodded: "I understand your intentions. My child." After speaking, he closed his eyes, seeming to be pondering something. Bai Duolu slipped away quietly.
