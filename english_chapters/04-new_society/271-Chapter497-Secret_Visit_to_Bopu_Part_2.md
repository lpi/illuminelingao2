# Chapter 497 - Secret Visit to Bopu (Part 2)

"Jiang Youling really ruined things!" Zhang Wen whispered beside him. "Now that the Australians have established themselves at Bopu, it will be hard to fight them."

"What do you know?!" Tang Yunwen rebuked. Zhang Wen was a distant relative of his, inheriting a hereditary position as a Small Banner. Tang Yunwen had promoted him to a Chiliarch in his Central Army Standard Battalion as his personal general. The affection was unlike that for ordinary people.

"Could the Australian cannons be made in Lingao?" Tang Yunwen said. "How many ships do we have for them to sink?"

Zhang Wen fell silent, his face seemingly unconvinced.

Tang Yunwen asked: "Where is the big iron ship?"

"The ship is inside the harbor, can't seek it from here," the boat boss said. "Have to go around Lingao Cape to see it."

"Go around and take a look!" Tang Yunwen naturally wanted to see the legendary big iron ship.

The boat slowly turned its rudder, rounding Lingao Cape. Tang Yunwen noticed that the security on Lingao Cape was very tight. The platform was surrounded by chevaux-de-frise and the like for protection. There were people resembling soldiers standing guard on the platform, carrying long muskets on their backs. Behind the platform, there was another tall, stone-built round tower. According to the boat boss, this was a newly built lighthouse. With this lighthouse, sailing at night and in bad weather was much safer.

Rounding Lingao Cape, the iron ship gradually appeared in Tang Yunwen's line of sight. In that instant, he held his breath—too big! Tang Yunwen had seen the big clip-board ships of the Franks and Red-haired barbarians; their huge hulls and cloud-piercing masts had left a deep impression on him. But compared to the big iron ship before him, they were completely unworthy of mention. A ship could actually be built so large!

"Good heavens, this ship is huge!" Zhang Wen couldn't help but say.

"This ship is now a scenic spot in Lingao; many people come to see it," the boat boss said. "It's taller than the prefectural city walls!"

"This ship has no masts and no oars or yulohs visible; how does it sail?" Tang Yunwen felt this ship couldn't possibly move by itself on the sea—how big a sail would be needed to move this giant ship? Moreover, it was made of iron; wouldn't it be many times heavier than wood?

"I heard people say it doesn't need sails or oars; the ship moves by itself," the boat boss said. "But I haven't seen it. This ship hasn't moved since it arrived at Bopu."

Zhang Wen said: "My Lord, this ship is probably iron-clad. Otherwise, using iron to build a ship, let alone sailing, it would sink as soon as it entered the water."

Tang Yunwen agreed deeply. He recalled hearing old shipwrights say that during the Chenghua and Xuande reigns, the Longjiang Shipyard had built a kind of Great Treasure Ship for ceremonial purposes. its form was extremely magnificent, with multi-layered palace pavilions on the deck, like a water city. But it couldn't sail by itself, nor go on long ocean voyages. When moving, it was towed by smaller boats. Presumably, this iron-clad big ship was handled the same way; otherwise, Tang Yunwen really couldn't imagine what power in this world could directly drive such a large ship across the sea.

"Even if it's iron-clad, this workmanship is amazing," Tang Yunwen commented. Looking up with the telescope again, he saw what appeared to be a cannon on the foredeck. Being experienced in military affairs, he had already marked three gun positions in his mind. With these three cannons, attacking Bopu directly from the sea would incur extreme danger.

While he was pondering, the boat boss suddenly said in a trembling voice: "Bad! A patrol boat is coming!" Tang Yunwen looked up and saw a single-masted small boat nearby, sailing at high speed with full sails. Its speed was simply like flying on the waves, but the hull tilted extremely severely; Tang Yunwen once thought it was about to capsize.

Tang Yunwen knew he couldn't escape at this point, so he hurriedly put away the telescope and hid it. He pretended to be a fisherman checking nets in the cabin. Zhang Wen, however was a bit nervous, his eyes constantly looking outside.

"Be calm." Tang Yunwen exhorted.

The patrol boat soon pulled alongside the fishing boat. The moment the two boats touched, several men wearing blue short jackets jumped over and landed on the fishing boat's deck, then threw over several ropes to tie the two boats firmly together.

Function judging from their agile movements, these men were clearly old hands at sea. Each wore a blue tight-fitting front-buttoned short jacket and a wide cloth belt with an iron buckle at the waist, looking very tough and capable.

Everyone had a short sword in a leather scabbard hanging to their thigh, and a triangular coarse cloth pouch hanging on the waist belt, fastened with straps and an iron buckle on the outside. It was unknown what it contained.

Looking at the blue short jackets on them, the style seemed simple at first glance, but a careful look revealed quite a few accessories. There were small black square patches on the upturned collars with crooked patterns on them. There were extra soft cloth loops on the shoulders, adorned with patterns and bars. He noticed the leader had fewer bars than the others, but they were much thicker.

Everyone also had a cloth strip pinned to their chest with the words "Coast Guard" written on it. He didn't know what it meant; Tang Yunwen guessed it was probably a sign of affiliation.

Upon boarding the boat, the men immediately spread out. Someone stood at the stern controlling the helmsman, while others urged the boat hands to lower the sails. They quickly controlled the key points of the entire ship.

On the boat opposite, two small cannons were already aimed at the fishing boat. Tang Yunwen had seen similar small cannons on Frankish ships and knew they were specially used to fire small iron pellets to kill sailors on deck.

Although these people were pirates, the whole boarding and control process was smooth and swift, showing they were well-trained elite troops. Tang Yunwen thought even his Central Army Standard Battalion couldn't do better than this. Probably not even this fast.

The leader shouted: "Where is this fishing boat from? Why aren't you flying a flag?"

He spoke Mandarin, but with an accent from Southern Fujian. This pirate was obviously not an Australian, but a rebellious subject of Great Ming, mostly likely a subordinate of Zhu Cailao who had defected to the Australians.

The boat boss had already bowed and scraped to meet him: "This lowly one hasn't received a flag yet..."

"How can you come here to fish without a flag?"

"We heard the harvest is good in the Lingao fishing grounds, so we came to check the situation first. If it's really good, we'll apply for a permit." The boat boss pointed to the cabin with a face full of smiles. "Little ones dare not break the rules. Look, the nets are stowed. There's not even a fish scale in the cabin, let alone fish and shrimp."

Tang Yunwen knew that according to the usual routine, the leader would inevitably pull a long face and scold them, then threaten to do this and that. The boat boss would naturally present the prepared silver at this time. As for inspection, it was nothing more than going through the motions.

However, this leader didn't use the routine words of intimidation and threat. He waved his hand directly, and his subordinates immediately dispersed, surprisingly searching cabin by cabin carefully. Even the coiled ropes and piled fishing nets were checked, very thoroughly.

The boat boss hurriedly dug out a few mace of silver from his waist and tried to stuff it over. But it was pushed back by the other party:

"Keep the silver yourself. If there's no illegal fishing, naturally we'll let you go." The leader said seriously, "If there is illegal fishing behavior, then apologies will be in order."

"There is absolutely no illegal fishing. This is a small token of appreciation for the vice commanders to buy wine," the boat boss still tried to stuff the silver into his hand.

The leader actually refused again. Not only did he refuse, but he also sternly reprimanded the boat boss. Tang Yunwen was dumbfounded watching this—judging by his appearance, the refusal to accept silver wasn't an act.

Refusing even silver delivered to the door—could these Australians still be considered pirates? Tang Yunwen had dealt with heroes of the sea often and knew that people took this path for various reasons, but in the end, it was entirely for wealth and women. Unexpectedly, such a group of money-hating pirates had appeared now!

After the inspection, naturally no catch was found. Tang Yunwen's telescope was hidden well and wasn't discovered. The leader registered the boat boss's name and the boat's home port before leaving. Before departing, he didn't forget to remind them: if they wanted to fish locally, they should register at Bopu as soon as possible. Recently, a "Fishery Association" had been established in Bopu, launching many beneficial methods for fishermen. If the boat boss was interested, he should go "take a look."

The boat boss naturally agreed repeatedly, sending the men off like a nodding bug. Only then did he order the sails raised. Seeing Tang Yunwen sitting under the mast staring dead at the departing patrol boat, he couldn't help but smile bitterly: "Boss, that really scared me to death."

"What are you afraid of! There are no weapons or seals on this boat. As long as you respond carefully, nothing will happen." Tang Yunwen asked, "Those who boarded just now were the Australian's subordinates, right?"

"Yes, they specialize in patrolling and inspecting these waters," the boat boss said. "This is a small boat; there are also two-masted big ships. The inspections are very tight! Recently they've caught quite a few scattered pirates. The sea here at Lingao is much more peaceful than in previous years. Coastal boat households and merchants all say that once a ship enters Lingao waters, it's safe."

In that case, the Australians were not only collecting "benefits" from the catch here but also capturing pirates and protecting merchants. Acting a bit like the government. Thinking of this, Tang Yunwen became vigilant; these Australians had no small ambition.

Zhang Wen suggested going ashore to take a look. To probe the situation on land, especially the defenses and artillery. But Tang Yunwen thought what they had seen was enough. Going ashore, there were many of Zhu Cailao's former subordinates here—some of whom had seen him. It would be trouble if he were recognized. But at this moment, he completely lost interest in using military force to expel the Australians—the disparity in strength was too great.

"Return to White Sand," Tang Yunwen ordered.

"My Lord, if we don't probe the situation on land clearly, if we want to raise troops for suppression in the future, wouldn't it be—" Zhang Wen advised in a low voice.

"It won't be too late to probe then." Tang Yunwen said. "This Lingao matter is very tricky. If we want to suppress them, it will require the power of the entire province."

The implication was that there would be no suppression for five or six months. Gathering the power of the entire province wasn't something he, a coastal defense assistant regional commander, could handle. Just writing reports and delivering circulars, piles of official paperwork aimed at avoiding responsibility, would take a month or so.

Moreover, with his status, coming outside Bopu Harbor to investigate was already "personally risking danger." There was no need for him to act as a spy and sneak into Bopu; he could just leave it to his subordinates.
