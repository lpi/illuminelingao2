# Chapter 399 - Agricultural Technician Wan Lihui

Wan Lihui thought Fu Buer was truly a model supporter of the transmigrator collective—Ding-Ding should really publicize this. Noticing the girl was quite tall, and though her skin was very dark, it looked quite lustrous. His heart stirred slightly. Making conversation, he asked:

"What was your master's wife just muttering about?"

"Nothing nice of course." Fu Xi covered her mouth, giggling. "Said you're just a hired hand, and the master giving you such a nice room means he's gone crazy."

Being called a hired hand—Wan Lihui could only smile wryly. In a way, wasn't he basically a hired hand at the Agricultural Committee too?

"The master's wife is like that." Fu Xi glanced toward the door. "Master gets pestered until he can't stand it, then beats his wife. Hehe. Good beating."

Apparently Fu Buer's wife normally treated household servants quite harshly—no sympathy for her at all.

"This is the Chief's luggage? I'll help organize."

"Hey, no need to trouble..."

"It's fine." Fu Xi helped unpack his luggage, spread his sleeping bag, took out the tea mug, toothbrush, and towel, arranging them neatly. She fetched a new white wooden basin from outside, poured hot water, and helped wring a towel for his face-washing. At 22, Wan Lihui had never had any girl care for him so attentively—he felt flattered and quite uncomfortable.

"We know you all like cleanliness." Fu Xi smiled with pressed lips. "Clothes worn just a few days need changing. The master ordered a bathing tub made—it'll be delivered tonight."

While she was busy, Fu Buer arrived at the room. His face was ashen—beating one's wife wasn't exactly a pleasant experience. Besides, though his wife took beatings, she absolutely wouldn't admit defeat verbally—so Fu Buer's ancestors, whether he'd met them or not, were all insulted.

Additionally, he still felt very uneasy about joining the Heaven and Earth Society, deeply fearing his wife was a jinx whose bad predictions always came true.

"Is Chief Wan satisfied with the accommodations?" Fu Buer forced a smile.

"Very good, very good." Wan Lihui, seeing his grim expression, answered carefully.

"Bring tea!"

"Coming right up."

The two sat facing each other in silence. Fu Buer couldn't speak Mandarin; Wan Lihui's Lingao dialect was poor. They had to wait for Fu Xi to bring tea before properly communicating.

Fu Buer's main concern was seeds. He saw that Wan Lihui had come alone with just a large pack—seeds for over a hundred *mu* of paddy couldn't possibly be carried this way.

"Rest assured, Mr. Fu. Our Society practices unified seedling cultivation and unified delivery."

Seedling cultivation was an important stage in rice planting, involving temperature management and seed-bed fertilizer technical issues.

After discussion, Agricultural Committee technicians concluded that for rice-rice-wheat rotation in this time-space's insufficient accumulated temperature, they had to use artificial warming for germination and seedling cultivation when temperatures were low, transplanting immediately when temperatures became adequate. Artificial warming for seedlings wasn't new—Jiangnan farmers had long used this method. But it had technical requirements and high fertilizer demands. To ensure seedling quality, the Society decided on unified cultivation in farm nurseries, then centralized delivery to fields. Not just seedlings—future agricultural production stages would see more such unified agricultural supply deliveries.

Fu Buer thought these Australians were truly cunning—probably guarding against others stealing their seeds. But come harvest, with grain everywhere, they couldn't possibly watch it all.

Wan Lihui asked detailed questions about Fu Buer's household—how many people, how many oxen. His questions made Fu Buer's heart pound—was this Society investigating everyone's situation before coming to "butcher pigs"? But the person was already here; he couldn't easily lie. So he reported everything truthfully.

Fu Buer's land was entirely self-farmed, no tenants. Workers included Fu Buer himself and his wife, two sons and one daughter, several household servants plus one hired hand. During busy seasons, they'd hire some temporary workers. Besides rice, they also grew sweet potatoes—introduced from the mainland just a few years ago. These were the two main crops. Also various miscellaneous grains: sesame, peanuts, soybeans, mung beans. Plus garden vegetables—couldn't sell for money, mainly for household consumption and feeding pigs.

Regardless of what was planted, land yields were limited. Whether rice or sweet potatoes, yields were low. The whole household including hired hands rose before dawn and slept past midnight, yet a year's work merely meant everyone ate their fill with slight savings. Even these savings had to be preserved—Lingao was plagued by minor disasters: drought, flooding, bandits, plus government's excess levies. Fu Buer always felt he couldn't accumulate money. He'd tried mainland methods: growing indigo, madder, tobacco, even sugarcane. But unable to afford mainland experts as overseers, all these ventures had failed.

After D-Day, thanks to transmigrators' hearty appetites, Meiyang Village had sold large quantities of vegetables, pigs, chickens, ducks, and eggs to Quanfu Vegetable Company—and Fu Buer's household finally showed some improvement. Now he'd added another ox.

Wan Lihui wanted to inspect the fields. Fu Buer, seeing he had no airs—arriving and immediately wanting to inspect fields after one drink of water—felt embarrassed, saying it was late today and raining outside. Better rest today and go tomorrow.

Wan Lihui checked his watch—only just past 2 PM. This counted as late? He insisted on at least looking around. Fu Buer had no choice but to send the head hired hand to accompany Wan Lihui to the fields.

The moment they left, they became a procession. A crowd of curious people followed at a distance, pointing and commenting the whole way. In such remote countryside without entertainment, gawking at outsiders was traditional leisure.

The Fu family's land wasn't contiguous. Fu Buer's great-grandfather, grandfather, father, and he himself had gradually acquired it over four generations through clearing, purchase, and usury—scattered in seven or eight locations around the village. Some plots were just one *mu* or fractions of vegetable gardens; others were several dozen *mu* of large paddy fields. The paddies' first-crop rice had just been harvested, now lying empty awaiting second-crop transplanting.

"If only the land were connected." Wan Lihui thought. Such fragmented land—how could agricultural modernization work? He examined the crops, squatted at field's edge, and studied the soil for a long time. He asked Fu Buer:

"Do you fertilize here?"

"Yes, we fertilize." Fu Buer said. Mainly from their own latrine pit and pigsty manure.

"Apply bean cake?"

Fu Buer said locally there was no soybean oil-pressing habit. Oil-pressing mainly used sesame and rapeseed. Leftover seed cake was generally used for feeding pigs.

"Not enough fertilizer." Wan Lihui shook his head. Your fields are severely fertilizer-deficient, especially nitrogen. Just applying fertilizer would yield much higher production.

Fu Buer didn't know what nitrogen fertilizer was, but he understood that land lacked fertilizer and soil fertility was insufficient. He answered:

"I know it's not enough, but fertilizer is hard to find."

In ancient times without chemical fertilizer, everything depended on farm manure. Farm manure sounds very eco-friendly, very green, very petit-bourgeois, but effective components were minimal. 1,000 *jin* of human waste's nitrogen content equaled only 25 *jin* of ammonium sulfate. Farmers spent enormous time, labor, and money collecting fertilizer. For densely-populated areas, fertilizer sources were plentiful—most conveniently from urban human waste and household garbage. But Lingao's urban population was tiny; obtainable fertilizer was very limited.

Wan Lihui recalled that before he'd come, Wu Nanhai had dispatched people everywhere investigating fertilizer sources—apparently even the Agricultural Committee couldn't secure sufficient fertilizer. He wondered how Nanbao's lignite development was progressing and what output might be.

Overall assessment: Fu Buer's land's basic problem was substantial soil fertility depletion. Annual double-crop rice with limited fertilization, plus no green manure cultivation habit, caused persistent low yields. Wan Lihui knew this wasn't an isolated phenomenon locally—during their countryside surveys, they rarely found land with healthy crop growth. Fertilizer shortage was a major reason.

Fu Buer was also troubled by this, but the problem wasn't easily solved. Organic fertilizer had low fertility, required large quantities, and needed local sourcing. If too distant, farmers' labor costs became unprofitable.

After surveying various plots and crops, Wan Lihui mentally drafted a plan.

He proposed to Fu Buer: this year's late rice acreage should be reduced by half, planting only fields with better soil fertility. Other poor-condition fields should be drained and switched to broad beans.

Planting legumes aimed to fix nitrogen. Rice's most needed fertilizer was nitrogen. Currently the Society couldn't immediately supply large quantities of nitrogen fertilizer; they could only use this method to increase soil fertility.

After broad bean harvest, he planned planting one season of alfalfa as green manure. Alfalfa could be cut several times; harvested stems and leaves served as fodder or compost. Remaining portions would be tilled under in spring, left to decompose, adding organic matter. This way, soil fertility could recover to some degree.

Fu Buer heard this technician wanted him to fallow half his land for broad beans, plus plant grass in winter. He shook his head vigorously—wouldn't this mean losing half his harvest? Land fertility might be poor, but there'd be some harvest. Who'd eat all these broad beans?

"The broad beans you grow—we'll buy them all."

Legumes were currently urgent agricultural products for the Committee—whether for cafeteria supply, horse feed, or food processing, all had great uses.

Fu Buer fell silent. Wan Lihui continued: Society rice seeds could double yields no problem—wouldn't these broad beans just be extra income? Product outlets weren't concerning—the Committee would purchase them. Vouchers received could be used for Society service fees—a risk-free measure.

*Puff puff*—Fu Buer just smoked his water pipe, wooden-faced, saying nothing. Wan Lihui grew anxious, saying loudly:

"You understand the policy! When has our transmigrator collective broken its word? Think it over carefully—this only has benefits, no drawbacks!"

These words had miraculous effect. Fu Buer had prisoner-camp experience. Last year, waiting outside the tent hearing interrogations inside, he'd often heard someone sternly saying "You understand the policy"—whoever "didn't understand" would be dragged out to endlessly circle the bonfire until they "understood."

Under dictatorship's coercion, Fu Buer finally agreed to the plan. But he weakly made one request: the Society must sign a written document guaranteeing purchase of all his broad beans.

"No problem. However much you have, we'll buy it all." Wan Lihui readily agreed. Broad beans had many uses at the Agricultural Committee whether as vegetables or concentrated feed; plus broad bean shells were excellent nitrogen fertilizer sources—in old Jiangnan countryside, during broad bean season, farmers would go to cities collecting bean shells for fertilizer.

That night Fu Buer and his wife fought again. Wan Lihui thought this wife was practically his nemesis, opposing him on everything.

Next morning, Fu Buer assembled the entire household. Wan Lihui was fortunate to see Fu Buer's wife—a dark, thin middle-aged woman wearing homespun clothes. Nothing like the legendary white, plump, silk-clad landlord's wife. This landlord's wife looked at Wan Lihui with guarded, suspicious, even hostile eyes that made his hairs stand on end.

The Fu family's three children seemed friendlier. The girl was the eldest daughter, probably sixteen or seventeen, braided like Fu Xi. The two girls stood close together, occasionally whispering. The two boys were probably around ten. Their appearances and clothes were no different from household servants.

Wan Lihui exchanged pleasantries, then began assigning work tasks. First task: composting.

"Starting today, except for plowing personnel, everyone prepares fertilizer." Wan Lihui told Fu Buer.

"Good." Fu Buer was glad to hear he had methods for obtaining new fertilizer. He and the hired hands would plow; he assigned Fu Qing, Fu Xiang, Fu Xi, and his own three children to Wan Lihui's use.

Wan Lihui led the six teenagers outside the village to cut grass. Vast wasteland outside Meiyang Village grew thick with various wild grasses. No one knew why he cut grass—locals didn't raise sheep; if for pig fodder, the quantity was excessive. Wan Lihui instructed: cut as much as possible, prioritizing bright green, juicy, soft stems and leaves. Grass-cutting was routine work for these teenagers. Each took out freshly-sharpened sickles and quickly mowed large swaths. Wan Lihui noticed the two girls worked quickly but frequently stopped to search the ground. Curious, he looked closer—alongside grass-cutting, they were gathering wild greens. Half a basket already accumulated. Wan Lihui wondered: this landlord family had their own vegetable garden, yet girls gathered wild greens? How stingy! No wonder novels called landlords penny-pinchers.

After cutting, he himself led Fu Buer's eldest son Fu Eryin and Fu Xi to the stream outside the village. Wan Lihui studied this small river—both Meiyang Village's drinking water source and sewage outlet. Water was greenish, banks thick with reeds, emitting waves of stench.

"This river really stinks!" Wan Lihui frowned. Theoretically ancient rivers weren't severely polluted and shouldn't smell this bad. But now he needed the smellier the better—a crystal-clear stream would be useless for his purposes.

Per his instructions, they fetched manure scoops, baskets, wooden rakes, shovels, and poles plus rope from the threshing ground. He had everyone use manure scoops and long-handled shovels to scoop river mud and weeds from the bottom. This novel activity drew many spectators—river-mud composting was unknown locally.

Black, foul-smelling mud and weeds were piled on the bank. After partial drainage, they were tossed into baskets, carried load by load to Fu Buer's field edges. Wan Lihui gained full appreciation for ancients' hard work—Fu Buer's eldest daughter Fu Yijin and Fu Xi carried loads no lighter than the boys'. And their loads—Wan Lihui himself absolutely couldn't carry.

"Good, next step is cleaning." Wan Lihui said, bringing out all of Fu Buer's brooms, giving everyone a large basket.

"Go to the village—wherever you see garbage on streets, roadsides, or open ground, except for broken bricks, tiles, and pottery shards, collect everything into baskets and bring to the fields."

Everyone looked at each other—what was this Australian planning? Why sweep village streets? Could that random garbage actually be fertilizer?

Thus these teenagers, under Wan Lihui's direction, swept and collected garbage throughout the village, causing a huge sensation. Australian cleanliness reputation was indeed well-founded! Fu Buer's household was already considered excessively clean locally; this Australian kid was actually cleaning the village too. Some made cutting jokes about Fu Buer: instead of properly farming, he'd inexplicably brought home a "daddy" to boss everyone around. Others felt the Australian was doing public service.

Wan Lihui had noticed the village had much garbage—garbage piles almost everywhere on roadside open ground, some simply dumped on roads. This garbage couldn't be directly used as fertilizer but after composting and maturation could become decent field base fertilizer.

Various garbage collected from the village quickly filled baskets: old straw from roof repairs, various chicken and duck feathers, discarded broken baskets, worn-out straw sandals, collapsed wooden tubs...

"Chief Wan, is this stuff for fertilizer?" Fu Xi finally couldn't help asking.

"Correct."

Fu Xi didn't ask further. Wan Lihui volunteered to explain organic matter, bacterial decomposition, why this stuff couldn't directly serve as fertilizer... fully indoctrinating Fu Xi on fertilizer principles. Not from strong desire to cultivate the next generation, but because this allowed him to legitimately talk with Fu Xi while collecting admiring gazes from the girl.
