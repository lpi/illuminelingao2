# Chapter 347 - Sweet Potato Kvass

Whether the common people of the Great Ming in Guangzhou would buy this Liancheng Red Heart Dried Sweet Potato Strip, which appeared ahead of its time, was an unknown variable. But Wu Nanhai always felt that selling dried sweet potatoes, such a fairly primary product, was really too low-class for making money.

Wu Nanhai said, "Dried sweet potatoes can count as one option, but the depth of development is not enough, and the added value is too low."

Mo Xiaoan said, "The problem is that the common people of the Great Ming don't need starch. Who do we sell the produced starch to?"

"The common people of the Great Ming don't need it, but we ourselves need it." Huang Dashan smiled unfathomably. "Not to mention industrial demand, it's also good for improving our meals. Starch can be used to make many products."

Everyone subconsciously moved a little away from this mysterious figure. It seemed his whole body was emanating terrifying microorganisms like bacilli and viruses. Actually, 99% of Huang Dashan's biochemical laboratory contained various useful strains; besides various mushrooms and fungi, there were also many fermentation strains in culture media.

"There is one thing that satisfies your export addiction and is also useful for improving everyone's meals—MSG," Huang Dashan said. "I have specialized strains available, and the quality won't be poor."

"Doesn't making MSG require rice?"

"Rice can certainly be used; actually, what acts is starch. So sweet potatoes, potatoes, and the like which are rich in starch all work; it's not strange." Huang Dashan said, "Cooking wine, vinegar, soy sauce, bean paste—these condiments we could originally make with rice. The reason why the food factory made very little before was mainly to save grain. Now with sweet potatoes as a bulk cheap starch source, we just need to expand the production scale directly."

Shi Niaoren talked about his glucose injection plan, and Wu Nanhai expressed strong support, saying make as much as needed. However, Shi Niaoren said not much was needed for now; a few kilograms would be enough.

"Making glucose injection doesn't take much."

Although glucose injection was very useful, it wasn't some urgently needed drug. Whether to make it or not didn't matter much. Shi Niaoren was anxious to get it out also to prove the value of the pharmaceutical factory's existence—after the Executive Committee invested so much, they couldn't just mix oral physiological saline to fool people all day long.

"The oral physiological saline and herbal tea you mix are quite good; mix more in the future." Wu Nanhai said, "The weather is hot recently, and they are especially needed."

"Actually, I want to make salt soda water." Shi Niaoren said, "Carbonated drinks represent thirst-quenching. But there is no baking soda to use now."

"Soda water is good, a new favorite of fashion—" It seemed Mo Xiaoan was ready to promote soda water to the people of the Great Ming.

"Baking soda mixed soda water?" Wu Nanhai sneered. "I mixed it according to books when I was little—terrible to drink! Very unsuccessful. You'd better spare us. Heard Superintendent Ma designed a soda machine? Doesn't use baking soda, can directly dissolve carbon dioxide into liquid."

"Correct, indeed possible—he just copied existing historical designs anyway. But where do we find high-purity carbon dioxide? Heard there are less than twenty pressure steel cylinders large and small in total; making soda water is definitely not an urgent matter."

Huang Dashan laughed out. "You guys are really modern enough, only knowing chemical preparation and physical processing. Forgotten about microorganisms—where does Champagne's gas come from? And beer? They are not made by adding baking soda or directly pumping carbon dioxide."

"You mean making beer, using sweet potatoes?" Wu Nanhai reacted very quickly.

Huang Dashan nodded. "Making beer needs malt; now wheat and barley are both in shortage. Otherwise, the Special Reconnaissance Team's Banana would have wanted to do it long ago. Haven't heard of making beer with sweet potatoes." He winked. "But I can make Kvass."

"Kvass?!" Several people shouted together. This thing was rare.

They had all heard the great name of this drink very popular in Russia and Eastern Europe. This drink was fermented from dry bread; the color was close to beer but slightly reddish, with moderate sweetness and acidity, a fragrant taste, rich gas content, and extremely low alcohol content. It was a soft drink very welcome by the public.

Traditional Kvass was fermented with bread. But Huang Dashan knew that to save costs and manufacturing time, some modern factories manufacturing Kvass omitted the bread process and directly used starch-rich raw materials, adding several kinds of natural or artificial synthetics aromatics. He had helped a boss in the Northeast develop the fermentation process of sweet potato Kvass in the past.

Mo Xiaoan said, "Kvass is much more high-class than soda water! There are many rich people in the Great Ming; Kvass can target the wealthy female market!"

"I think having enough for ourselves to drink would be not bad." Wu Nanhai said, "Can it work?"

"Making Kvass with sweet potatoes is a new technology developed in the 90s." Huang Dashan said, "The process is simple. The drawback is it lacks the aroma of bread Kvass, and there are no synthetic essences available here, so we have to artificially add some things."

"How to solve the sealing of Kvass? There is no soda bottle capping machine, nor tinplate to make bottle caps. It acts as a carbonated beverage."

"How Champagne is sealed, Kvass can likely be sealed the same way." Huang Dashan said, "Cork stopper, tightened with iron wire outside, plus wax seal. Champagne's bottle pressure is much greater than this. I haven't seen a capping machine, but presumably, it's not high-tech; can be built in the future. Tinplate, as long as there is iron and tin, can be made, right?"

"Need any equipment?"

"A few large vats are sufficient." Huang Dashan had a well-thought-out plan. "But various culture materials I need must be guaranteed to be allocated in full amount—now the demand for strains and enzymes is getting larger and larger, and there are gaps in equipment and culture media."

Different from traditional Kvass making, Huang Dashan's flow was very simple. First, peel and grind sweet potatoes into slurry, mix into a liquid with 75% water content, then watching the thermometer, he first added a small piece of something like culture medium.

After an hour, he added another piece of similar stuff. Just like this, on average every 30 to 60 minutes he would add some seemingly very suspicious things. During this period, he constantly commanded the stoker to add or reduce fuel, controlling the temperature.

"What is this?" Wu Nanhai couldn't help asking.

"Several kinds of enzymes." Huang Dashan replied, "Cytolytic enzyme, Pectinolytic enzyme, several amylases..."

The enzymes added sequentially decomposed all dextrin in the sweet potato slurry into sugar.

Next was the fermentation procedure. He continued adding suspicious substances, this time proteolytic enzyme.

Wu Nanhai watched him inoculating, heating, adding water back and forth, bustling with joy, but felt very suspicious about what exactly he was doing—Huang Dashan didn't look like he was making a fermented beverage, but rather like mixing liquid medicine.

Finally, after boiling, cooling, and filtering, into the filtered juice, Huang Dashan carefully poured culture fluids from two culture tubes respectively.

"This is Brewer's Yeast and *Lactobacillus delbrueckii* culture fluid."

"Yeast is easy to talk about, but his *Lactobacillus* won't be a problem, right?" Wu Nanhai was deeply worried about things like bacilli.

"No problem." Huang Dashan didn't explain much. Instructed the stoker to control the temperature well, keeping the liquid temperature at 26°C throughout, letting it ferment slowly. "Filter and bottle after fermentation ends in 16 hours, sterilize with Pasteurization method, then let it stand for a few days. Wait until it produces foam, and the Kvass is done."

"That's it?!" Wu Nanhai felt very confused—it was completely different from what he imagined.

"This is the power of bio-engineering." Huang Dashan said proudly. "This is just a trial product. If conditions allow, add some natural essential oils, fruit juice, honey, citric acid or something, and the taste will be better."

"Citric acid is really a good thing; making canned food and soda water both need it. If only the Chemical Department could produce it." Wu Nanhai thought citric acid had certain water purifying, disinfecting, and sterilizing effects; adding it to livestock feed could increase protein digestion rate and improve feed utilization rate.

As for the food processing factory itself, it also needed this food additive very much—it would be used as an acidic flavoring agent in the manufacture of drinks, soda water, candy, pastries, biscuits, canned food, dairy products, etc. Finally, citric acid was also an antioxidant for edible oil—the coconut oil pressing project preparing to start needed it.

Huang Dashan disapproved. "What does it have to do with the Chemical Department."

"Doesn't citric acid come from chemical plants?"

"Citric acid is made by fermentation method," Huang Dashan said. "Submerged fermentation of dried potato powder for citric acid—this is our country's unique technology. I have this strain too."

"We have sweet potatoes too!" Wu Nanhai said.

"Customize a fermentation tank." Huang Dashan nodded. "I remember the Planning Committee didn't bring specialized fermentation tanks. Fermentation tanks don't have high technical content; can be built with carbon steel."

Thus the production launch of Kvass and MSG was listed in the plan. Wu Nanhai and Mo Xiaoan discussed a bit, went to the Grand Library to check materials, found several sets of architectural design drawings and equipment drawings for indigenous sweet potato processing enterprises, and sent them to the Planning Committee for approval. The approval slip came down very quickly.

Mo Xiaoan went to find Jiang Ye—showed him the equipment requirements and drawings. Jiang Ye took a few glances: It's simply all wooden structure. Except for shafts and grinding knives being iron, unexpectedly everything was wood products. Even transmission rods and gears were.

"Where did this come from?"

"From the Great Leap Forward era commune sweet potato processing factory drawings in the Grand Library." Mo Xiaoan said, "Almost no steel used, pretty much all wood. Saves material, easy to process."

Jiang Ye shook his head. "This kind of stuff, to put it mildly is emergency substitute, to be frank is window dressing for leaders to see." He pointed at the structure drawing of the sweet potato washer. "All-wooden mechanism roller, hardwood lever, wooden gear... tsk tsk, did the designer consider material strength problems? And manual cranking too; hundreds of jin of sweet potatoes, plus a pool full of water, even calling the Governor here might not move it." He continued looking. "If this set of things is made, it will all finish in less than a few days. Even building it all with red sandalwood would be the same."

"So it won't work?"

"The structure drawn has no problem, but materials must be changed." Jiang Ye took a pen and scribbled on it for a while. "I have to redesign it."

"How many days to finish?" Although Mo Xiaoan wasn't from the Agricultural Committee, he knew sweet potatoes couldn't be kept for long.

"At least a week." Jiang Ye studied the drawings for half a day. "Engineer Wang held a mechanical manufacturing standardization meeting for us, requiring that various professional processing equipment must be manufactured with standardization, unifying materials and process flows. Sweet potato processing complete sets are definitely no exception. So it has to be redesigned. Materials, performance, various aspects must be considered comprehensively, can't just blindly start from saving materials. In addition, you need a prime mover. Otherwise, it can't drive the machine. Don't believe this flowery Great Leap Forward pamphlet—many things inside are for fooling leaders."

"I'll apply for a steam engine; just right to bring a boiler."

"No need, apply for a single-cylinder diesel engine. This set of equipment can be driven by 10 horsepower. Don't think about steam engines and boilers now—riveters are in shortage; Zhou Bili and his apprentices are all building ships. When they will be free to build boilers is still a question mark."

"Diesel, don't we have to apply for diesel—" Mo Xiaoan hesitated greatly. Diesel was a very precious thing; thinking with toes one would know that the sweet potato processing project couldn't get a diesel quota.

"Use coal gas." Jiang Ye began to promote the latest coal gas generator developed by the Industrial and Energy Committee.

This brand new coal gas generator was developed under Wang Luobin's hosting; the purpose was naturally to utilize the large number of single-cylinder diesel engines on hand. In addition, the diesel engine factory project he personally hosted was also entering the implementation stage.

The technical content of single-cylinder diesel engines was very low. As the machinery factory's supporting workshops, especially the casting workshop, were completed, and apprentices in the new space-time became increasingly skilled, manufacturing single-cylinder diesel engines was no longer a fantasy. Compared to steam engines, single-cylinder diesel engines had huge advantages in volume and fuel efficiency, but the drawback was also obvious—no fuel. Whether diesel or vegetable oil which could serve as a substitute, the Transmigration Group was in severe shortage.

In the obvious next few years, neither vegetable oil nor diesel would be abundant, so the coal gas generator, this artifact of petroleum shortage eras, was thought of.

They wouldn't lack coal. Even without coal, things like straw, wood, and charcoal could still be found. Basically, there were no worries about the rear. Moreover, coal gas could be directly used by diesel engines and gasoline engines, as long as the engine was adjusted slightly. Thus, modern vehicles brought by them could continue to serve them after installing a coal gas generator, until the Transmigration Group could develop petroleum.

Coal gas generators would affect engine power output, but Germany also installed this thing on their half-track armored personnel carriers at the end of WWII. It was said that even the Panther tank weighing nearly 50 tons had experimentally installed coal gas generators. Presumably, the impact on power wouldn't be too far off.

Wang Luobin designed several different styles of coal gas generators. One small type was specially configured for vehicles, and another was a medium-sized coal gas generator complete set specially for enterprise supporting use. It adopted the flat-suction principle. The structure of this furnace was relatively complex, but it could adapt to low-grade fuels.
