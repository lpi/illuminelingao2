# Chapter 503 - He Xin

"Yes, that's me…" He Xin had been addressed only as "130080" for months and was slow to respond to his own name. He hesitated a moment before answering.

"You want him, sir?" Fu Youdi chuckled. "This fellow's just a pretty boy—useless as a laborer."

Lin Baiguang ignored him and studied the former pirate chief intently.

He Xin watched the Australian stare up and down his body without a word, and his legs began to tremble. The memory of the SM-gay films they had shown him during interrogation remained vivid.

The erstwhile pirate and erstwhile playboy stood nearly naked, clad only in a ragged loincloth, his body marked with bruises shallow and deep from rattan switches. Fu Youdi was a ruthless one indeed—no wonder his name struck terror into the hearts of the county's indigenous populace. Observing Fu Youdi's recently thickened waistline, Lin Baiguang suspected the man might be lining his pockets through his prison fiefdom.

That, however, was none of his concern. Lu Yifan could take his time rooting out official corruption.

"Rinse him off first and get him some clothes," Lin Baiguang ordered Fu Youdi.

Back at camp with a marginally more human-looking He Xin, Lin Baiguang instructed Gao Di to take him to bathe. The "purification" protocol could be skipped—the labor-reform camp had already seen to that.

When He Xin emerged from his bath in clean clothes, he finally looked respectable. Over the past months he had passed from "heaven" to "hell," and now someone had lifted him out again. It felt like a dream.

He had no idea why he had been plucked from that inferno. The Australian who had retrieved him was a stranger—not one of the men he had encountered when visiting Lingao to buy grain on Grand Master Zhu's orders.

At the thought of the grand master, He Xin sank into despair. News of Zhu Cailao's total annihilation had long since circulated in the labor camp. At first he had refused to believe it, but later, after new batches of petty pirates captured for robbery in the Qiongzhou Strait arrived—including some of Zhu Cailao's old followers—the story was confirmed beyond doubt.

His great backer, Zhu Cailao, was dead. What did this Australian want with him now? He Xin wondered anxiously. He possessed no real expertise: although he had spent more than a decade as a "pirate," he had never fought or killed anyone; nor had he mastered navigational skills like reading the stars or handling a ship. All he had was a bag of tricks for eating, drinking, whoring, and gambling.

Could it be questions about Grand Master Zhu's treasure? He Xin recalled being interrogated for what felt like an eternity in a windowless cell, answering endless questions about every last trivial detail of the grand master's organization.

Perhaps, now that the grand master was dead, the Australians coveted his wealth? He Xin truly knew nothing about that. Remembering the endless days and nights of interrogation in that dark room—and the threat of being "sold to the foreigners' boy-brothel"—his legs went weak.

Even as he indulged these anxious fantasies, the Australian who had rescued him from "hell" came to see him. Gao Di also brought in a tray of food.

The meal came from the general mess at the quarantine camp—nothing fancy, but it included fish, meat, shellfish, and other seafood. Compared to the labor camp's fare of coarse rice, saltwater aplenty but not a drop of oil, and miscellaneous vegetable soup, it was a feast.

The labor camp's rations had been designed by nutritionist Dr. Chen Sigen to supply sufficient carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals so that the inmates would not quickly perish under heavy labor. Palatability was not a consideration.

He Xin's tears and drool flowed in tandem, yet months of rattan-switch discipline had conditioned him well: even with delicacies before him, he dared not eat until ordered.

"Go ahead and eat something," Lin Baiguang said. "Don't worry—you're mine now."

"Thank you for your great kindness, sir—" He Xin nearly broke into sobs and hurried to prostrate himself in gratitude.

"No need to kowtow." Lin Baiguang stopped him. "Eat first. We'll talk after."

He Xin bowed his head and attacked the food. Such fare would once have been beneath his notice during his pirate days; now it tasted exquisite. Thinking of all he had endured, he wept as he chewed.

"What are you crying about? A grown man, shedding tears over a little hardship."

"I—I wouldn't dare…" He Xin wiped his eyes while cramming food into his mouth.

"Work hard for me from now on, and I won't treat you poorly."

"Yes, yes, I will certainly…" A mouthful of rice cut off his sentence.

"If you fail to deliver, I'll send you back."

"I wouldn't dare—wouldn't dare." He Xin was so frightened he stopped eating and threw himself down to kowtow again.

"Get up and finish your meal first." Lin Baiguang had spent several days recently shadowing Xiong Buyou, observing the manners and bearing of powerful figures as they moved through the county yamen and the homes of local grandees.

When He Xin had cleaned his bowl, Gao Di cleared the table. Only then did Lin Baiguang ask, "I hear you're quite the reveler?"

He Xin was startled. The words "quite the reveler" were ambiguous. After a long pause, he replied, "I've been foolish in the past—fond of dice and drinking…"

"What sorts of things do you know? Tell me everything." Fearing He Xin might hold back, Lin Baiguang encouraged him: "I'll be frank with you. I'm going to Qiongshan on business, and I intend to make use of your talents."

Suddenly enlightened, He Xin realized the Australian wanted him as a social escort—a sycophant. That was his specialty. His spirits soared; since he was a man without guile, his face immediately relaxed. He boasted at once: "I wouldn't claim to know too much, but I'm versed in kickball, backgammon, chess, card games, word puzzles, and singing—and I can even play the *pipa*."

Lin Baiguang nodded—genuine professional skills—and asked, "Do you know your way around pleasure houses and gambling dens?"

"Begging your pardon, sir," He Xin said with an ingratiating smile, "before I joined Grand Master Zhu, I had nowhere to turn for food or shelter, so I scraped by in the pleasure districts, living off the patronage of gentlemen clients. Across Guangdong—high, middle, and low-class establishments—I know them all. I'm on familiar terms with quite a few madams even now."

"Can you write?"

"Yes—I spent a few years at a private school. I can compose letters…"

"Good. From now on, you'll attend me as a guest-retainer." Lin Baiguang said, "In a few days I'll be leaving on business, and you'll come along."

"Yes, sir—I will serve you with all my heart and soul." Upon hearing that he would be leaving Lingao, He Xin's spirits soared: the farther from this place, the farther from the terrifying demon Fu Youdi.

"Henceforth you will address me as 'Master,'" Lin Baiguang instructed.

Gao Di pushed open the door with a porcelain bottle—a medicine he had just fetched from Lingao General Hospital. It was the Runshitang's newest remedy for bruises and contusions, formulated from a prescription Liu San had obtained among the confiscated property of Lin Changsan, the yamen's beadle chief. Beadles oversaw punishment, and their headmen invariably possessed ancestral salves for beating wounds. Liu San and Yang Shixiang refined the formula together, producing this topical medicine, which Liu San named *Sanli Tong*—"Pain Disperser."

*Sanli Tong* had received enthusiastic reviews from its trial run in Foshan. With the cool autumn weather setting in, Zhuge March Powder and the Plague-Repelling Powder were moving into their slow season; a remedy that worked year-round on contusions and both external and internal injuries filled a timely gap.

"Strip down and let Brother Gao apply the medicine."

"Thank you, Master." Tears streamed down He Xin's face.

After the medicine was applied, Lin Baiguang offered a few more words of reassurance and told him to rest. He then stepped out of the room with Gao Di.

"Tell Yang He to assign someone to watch him."

"Understood." Gao Di nodded knowingly.

Lin Baiguang then visited the Finance Commission to draw three hundred taels' worth of silver—Qiongshan as yet had no Delong branch bank, so bills of exchange were useless.

"Will that be enough?" Cheng Dong asked.

"Plenty," Lin Baiguang replied. "It only has to tide me over for a month or two. Once the grain shop opens, it will generate its own operating funds."

"Very well. But although Wanfeng is the intelligence station's cover, it's still an enterprise directly under the Executive Committee…"

"I understand—drawing money requires proper paperwork." Lin Baiguang said. "Give me the forms."

"Here are the disbursement vouchers." Cheng Dong handed him a small jewelry box fitted with a tiny padlock. Inside were several stacks of printed vouchers, a box of carbon paper, pencils, a dedicated ledger, and several wooden stamps.

Cheng Dong explained the procedures for requisitioning and reimbursing funds, and reminded him: "All vouchers are numbered. Even voided ones must be retained without exception."

"Naturally. As Wanfeng Grain Shop's sole signatory, you can approve and disburse funds at your discretion. But every financial record must be complete—the Audit Commission will dispatch inspectors to review the Qiongzhou Station and Wanfeng's books at random intervals."

"The stricter the financial controls the better—I'm all for it," Lin Baiguang said. "That way no one can suspect those of us working in the field of lining our pockets."

Lin Baiguang then made whirlwind visits to several other departments, collecting the equipment and supplies he would need. Filling out forms, issuing receipts, obtaining stamps and signatures—it all felt as though he had returned to his days as a civil servant.

Institutionalization, it seemed, was essentially bureaucratization at its core. Watching the ever-expanding Executive Committee, Lin Baiguang thought as he climbed yet another staircase on aching legs.

A few days later, Lin Baiguang, now dressed as a wealthy Ming merchant, set sail from Bopu with his entourage.

He departed feeling light and free. Many transmigrators had developed a special affection for Lingao—for Bairen Fortress—viewing it as a second home, a cozy haven. Whenever duty summoned them away, they left reluctantly. Lin Baiguang, however, felt none of this. Instead, he experienced a liberating sensation, as though the sky had suddenly opened wide. He sensed, hazily, that Qiongzhou would be only the starting point of a long road ahead. He would not return to Lingao.
