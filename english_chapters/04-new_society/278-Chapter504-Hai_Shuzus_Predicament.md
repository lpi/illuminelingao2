# Chapter 504 - Hai Shuzu's Predicament

In the cabin below deck of the *Guangding*, Lin Baiguang leaned against his bedroll, pondering the urgent tasks awaiting him in Qiongshan.

First and foremost was cultivating Hai Shuzu. Originally, the transmigrated collective had hoped to lure him to Lingao under the pretext of reclaiming his ship, using the opportunity to win him over. However, Hai Shuzu clearly harbored suspicions and refused to venture to Lingao.

Of course, were I in his shoes, I wouldn't dare come rashly either, Lin Baiguang thought. Who knows what the Australians are plotting? Hai Shuzu was, after all, a man of some means.

If he wouldn't come to Lingao, the collective would simply gain a large seagoing vessel and a shipload of cargo at no cost—not a bad outcome. Yet by comparison, Hai Shuzu himself was far more valuable to them. It was not that they intended to exploit his status as a descendant of Hai Rui to court local gentry; there were more practical applications.

The Industry Commission had been petitioning the Executive Committee to find a way to mine coal near Qiongshan. The coal deposits in the Haikou region were among Hainan's better reserves, predominantly lignite suitable for coking. Once the Tiandu iron mine was developed, coking coal would become a major bottleneck. The high-grade anthracite from Vietnam's Hongji mine was ill-suited for coking and came with all the difficulties of extraction in a foreign land, not to mention the constraints of shipping capacity. The Industry Commission wanted a nearby source of stable coal supply.

In this era, however, the Haikou region's coal deposits had yet to be exploited on any significant scale. Opening a mine in ancient times was a troublesome affair—not because of bureaucratic red tape or excessive taxation, but because mining operations often faced interference from local powers. Sometimes it was driven by economic interests; other times it involved claims about "fengshui" or "earth veins"; and occasionally it was suppressed by primitive environmental concerns—mining and smelting inevitably degraded local environments and caused serious pollution.

Official attitudes toward mining were inconsistent and highly arbitrary. Generally speaking, local officials were unenthusiastic: the Ming had no concept of a resource tax, and aside from the brief mining levy during the Wanli reign, mining offered no benefit to local finances. Though it could line the pockets of various minor and major clerks, mining invariably attracted hordes of workers. Laborers had always been considered a "destabilizing element," often imposing heavy "stability maintenance" burdens on the government. With no benefits and plenty of trouble to stir up, officials usually opted for outright prohibition whenever disputes arose.

Without a powerful local figure to preside over affairs—or at least a connection to such a person as a protective umbrella—a mine was nearly impossible to open.

Because of these unfavorable factors, the transmigrated collective had refrained from rashly dispatching an agent—someone like Lin Quan'an—to invest directly in mining. Instead, they hoped to entice locals to open mines themselves while the collective purchased the output. But mining did not yield coal overnight; the required investment was substantial. If the transmigrated collective's purchase price was too low, no one would bother mining; if too high, the Planning Commission deemed it uneconomical.

So they eventually adopted a different approach: find a local agent to serve as the front while the transmigrated collective actually invested in the mining operation.

From the Executive Committee's perspective, Hai Shuzu was an ideal agent. With the Hai family's prestige, smoothing things over with local officials and power brokers would be relatively easy.

How then to persuade Hai Shuzu? Lin Baiguang mulled it over. The fact that Hai Shuzu had pooled funds to build a ship and venture into overseas trade suggested an adventurous streak and a strong desire for wealth. With these two premises in hand, persuading such a man to open a mine should not be difficult. Moreover, according to the intelligence Chen Tong had gathered, the Hai family was currently facing a severe financial crisis—an excellent opportunity.

Lin Baiguang calculated on the cabin floor again and again. Time was of the essence. The present coke ovens used coal purchased from Guangdong; consumption was still low and manageable. But once the first shipments of iron ore arrived from Tiandu next year, coke would immediately become a bottleneck for the steel industry.

After Lin Baiguang's arrival in Qiongzhou, the managers and clerks transferred from Leizhou, as well as the escorts brought in from Guangdong, arrived one after another. Renovations of the property proceeded apace.

During this interval, Lin Baiguang instructed Chen Tong to intensify the infiltration of the Hai household to stay abreast of firsthand developments. He dispatched Gao Di to conduct a general survey of local social conditions.

After seven or eight days, the information gathered was encouraging for Lin Baiguang. Hai Shuzu's fund-raising effort to build a ship and trade at Batavia had drawn investments from fifty-one households in money or goods, totaling ninety shares. Hai Shuzu himself held twenty-three. The composition of these fifty-one investors was highly complex: members of the Hai clan, relatives, friends, small local merchants attracted by the promise of profits from Western trade—even household servants from the Hai family and other households who had pooled their savings to collectively take four shares.

Among the ninety shares, such minor investors were numerous; some held only half a share. Hai Shuzu's failed venture dealt these small shareholders a devastating blow—many had staked their entire life savings, their coffin money, on this "investment." These small investors, with virtually no capacity to absorb risk, were hardly about to accept a phrase like "maritime trade carries risk; invest with caution" and quietly nurse their wounds or jump off a bridge. Nor did they understand concepts like "limited liability." Instead, they descended on the gates of the Hai residence daily, creating uproarious scenes and demanding repayment.

For Hai Shuzu, who placed great importance on family reputation, this was tantamount to a public slap in the face. Engaging in maritime commerce was already considered undignified among the literati; now this scandal only made his humiliation worse.

His troubles did not end there. Besides the shareholdings, there were also loans—otherwise he could never have built such a large seagoing vessel. Loans naturally carried interest, and the rates were not low. When creditors heard the ship had been seized by pirates, they too showed up at his door to dun him.

Worst of all was a third group: neither shareholders nor creditors, but small peddlers who had been passengers on the Hai family's ship. Most of them had been rescued by the transmigrated collective and not only survived but recouped some of their financial losses. Yet many had lost both loved ones and capital. Widows and orphans, hair disheveled, came to his gates to wail and demand he "return our lives."

"There really is no defense against this," Lin Baiguang sighed. "Maritime trade truly is not for the faint of heart."

"Master, as the saying goes, people only see the thief eating meat, never the thief taking a beating," Gao Di remarked. "Many have ruined themselves in maritime trade. I heard Master Gao speak of it often when I worked in his household—some perished at sea, some lost everything, others lost their capital and were stranded abroad unable to return home… Even Master Gao himself has lost ship and cargo several times, totaling tens of thousands of taels."

Lin Baiguang nodded. The accidental risks of maritime trade were simply too great, and what made it even more terrifying was the commercial custom of "unlimited liability"—all of one's public and private assets could be seized to satisfy debts. A single failed venture could leave a merchant utterly broken, never to recover.

Hai Shuzu was of course well aware of this terrible outcome. And he was, after all, a descendant of Hai Gong—the famous Hai Rui. If he were to fall so low, it would not merely be a matter of personal gain or loss; it would disgrace his family name.

Lin Baiguang could easily imagine Hai Shuzu's current state of mind.

After long deliberation, he asked Chen Tong, "What is the state of the Hai family's assets?"

"An empty shell," Chen Tong replied. Besides two hundred *mu* of ancestral ritual land held by the clan collectively, the Hai family possessed fewer than two hundred *mu* in private holdings. Movable property was negligible—Hai Rui had been renowned for his incorruptibility, so poor at his death that he could not afford a proper coffin. Naturally, his descendants had little by way of wealth.

Because the family had produced such a celebrated figure known for integrity, and in order to safeguard the family's reputation, the Hais avoided the underhanded money-making schemes commonly employed by local gentry.

"Truly remarkable!" Lin Baiguang exclaimed. "Worthy descendants of Hai Gong indeed."

"Just so," Chen Tong agreed fervently. "Everyone's saying this is a tribulation decreed by fate."

"If the Hai family can weather this calamity, they will surely prosper," Lin Baiguang remarked obliquely. "It all depends on whether Hai Shuzu has the necessary discernment."

He instructed Gao Di, "Go and find out whether the creditors who lent money to the Hai family might be willing to sell their promissory notes."

Gao Di understood at once. "I understand."

"Don't rush in—drive a hard bargain," Lin Baiguang cautioned. "Hai Shuzu's notes will soon be worth nothing."

If Hai Shuzu had no other source of income and no external financial support, he was in effect already bankrupt. Lin Baiguang did a rough mental calculation: repaying debts and interest alone would be enough to make him lose everything.

"This matter of buying up debts must be handled discreetly," Lin Baiguang admonished Gao Di.

He was not buying the debts out of charity but to use as leverage. If word got out, it would benefit neither party.

At this moment, Hai Shuzu had fled altogether to Guangzhou. He was at his wits' end. Ever since his ship was plundered in the strait, he had not slept a single peaceful night. Some of those aboard had gradually returned, and from their mouths he learned only that the ship had been attacked by pirates in the Qiongzhou Strait. Fortunately, the Australians from Lingao had come to their rescue and everyone escaped with their lives; they had even managed a bit of trade in Lingao. The five-masted ship had also been towed there for salvage. Because the manager Hai Shuzu had sent along with the ship had died, he dared not put much faith in the accounts of the small traders and sailors. It was not until the ship's navigator returned, bearing a letter and gifts from the Australians, that he learned the details.

Invited to come in person to Lingao to reclaim ship and cargo, Hai Shuzu had hesitated—not because he didn't want to go. Going to Lingao at least offered a sliver of hope of recovering some capital; staying put was simply awaiting doom. But his family and friends urged him not to go, warning that the Australians might be baiting a trap to kidnap him for ransom.
