# Chapter 291: Sweet Port Turbulence – The Gu Family Pirates

There were several such small bands of fisher-pirates in the area, and the Gu family group was considered somewhat powerful. These small pirate bands were quite a scourge in Leizhou, but to the Haiyi Guild, they were nothing. The Haiyi Guild organized its own militia. Every time sugar ships went to sea, they traveled in convoys with hundreds of sailors and militiamen. Such small pirate groups couldn't gnaw on them at all. Not only could they not gnaw, but they also risked breaking their teeth.

What the Haiyi Guild feared were naturally the large gangs like Liu Xiang and Zhu Cailao, so they paid heavy bribes to buy peace. But for these small pirate bands, they inevitably had to offer some token gestures to avoid harassment. Otherwise, no matter how many militiamen they had, they would be run ragged.

However, the so-called token gestures were very limited. Because although small pirate bands operated at sea, they inevitably had to come ashore to rest, repair ships, buy rice, and settle the sick and wounded. They needed reliable havens on shore. So establishing relations with local powerful figures was necessary.

Third Master Zhu utilized this point. Using both soft and hard tactics, he reached agreements with several nearby small maritime forces. The other side guaranteed not to rob sugar ships sailing from Hai'an and not to harass Hai'an Street. In return: the Haiyi Guild provided convenience for these small groups of pirates' onshore activities in Xuwen. Such social interactions didn't cost much money and sometimes could even be put to use.

Over time, although nearby small pirate bands rose and fell—sometimes wiped out, sometimes accepted amnesty, sometimes disbanded—the Haiyi Guild and these surrounding small forces always maintained good relations. It relied on each taking what they needed.

Gu Dachun, as the gang leader, valued loyalty. Although his relationship with the Haiyi Guild was merely mutual utilization, once when Third Master Zhu led a fleet and encountered a storm at sea, Gu Dachun happened to be sheltering near the shore. He braved the risk to sail out and guide most of the sugar ships to a sheltered spot. Third Master Zhu felt this man kept faith and valued righteousness, a very usable object, so he became sworn brothers with him. After years of association, their friendship grew deep, and Gu Dachun married his newly widowed sister to Third Master Zhu as the sixth concubine.

In a sense, this was a political marriage. Third Master Zhu originally held this thought: firstly, the bride was a "withered flower" remarrying; secondly, coming from a fishing family, how much beauty could she have? Presumably, the brother just loved his sister and wanted to give her a stable home. He would just marry her, arrange a place, and look after her with food and clothing.

Unexpectedly, after marriage, it turned out otherwise. Although the sixth concubine came from a fishing family, her appearance was quite good, completely lacking the rough look of a sea family. Rare was that she was considerate in serving people, skilled in needlework and cooking. Asking revealed that this sister had been sold to a local wealthy household as a maid in early years and taken as a concubine. After the master died, she was expelled by the main wife. She served the over-fifty Third Master Zhu very comfortably.

Since there was the Gu Dachun line, why not just use it? It would be of great benefit to himself and others. He made up his mind: use strong medicine!

Once this strong medicine was applied, they would naturally become submissive immediately. In his words, it was pulling the firewood from under the cauldron. No matter how much strength South China had, they would be trapped to death in Leizhou.

"Qiuhan!" He called. This name was the sixth concubine's name when she was a maid. In old times women had no names; even names from maidhood were kept.

"What is it, Master?" The woman responded and came.

"Is your brother well recently?"

Qiuhan was somewhat surprised. Master rarely mentioned her brother in front of her because her brother did things against the King's law. To avoid trouble, she didn't mention having a brother in front of others.

"He is well. Master forgot, someone came to deliver things a few days ago."

"Mm, mm, right." Third Master Zhu remembered.

"Are the brothers living well?"

"How can we talk about good or bad! Just getting by." Speaking of her own family, Qiuhan couldn't help but sigh about difficulties. So-called pirates varied greatly between big and small gangs. For pirates like the Gu family, even big gangs wouldn't accept them for joint operations—three or four single-masted small boats, not even a cannon. Called coastal robbery, with limited strength, they could only harm small boat owners sailing along the coast. Naturally, they couldn't grab anything good.

"Right now, there is a path to wealth. I wonder if your brother is willing to take it?"

"Really?" Qiuhan was pleasantly surprised. Although Third Master Zhu took care of her family, this was the first time he had said such words.

"When has Master ever deceived you?" Third Master Zhu said with a smile.

"Thank you for Master's grace." Qiuhan curtsied.

"Grind ink—" Just as he wanted to pick up the brush to write a letter, he felt it inappropriate. Once this letter fell into outsider hands, it would be big trouble. Better to let someone say it face to face.

"Go back to your maiden home—" Third Master Zhu said in a low voice. "Tell your brother there is a huge fortune near Hai'an Street recently." He described the sugar ships that would soon leave port from South China Factory.

"The Haiyi Guild won't have ships leaving port recently. Tell your brother, as long as he identifies the South China mark, just go for it!"

"There is such a good thing?" Qiuhan said in surprise, lighting his silver water pipe for him.

"That's right. After he succeeds, I will buy all the sugar! No need for him to worry."

"Thank you for Master's grace!" Qiuhan curtsied again, this time completely beaming with joy.

"Who told him to be my brother-in-law? If I don't help him, who do I help?" He smiled and touched Qiuhan's cheek, but in his heart, he calculated well. Large cargoes robbed by pirates were hard to transport and store, so they were extremely cheap when sold violently, probably less than 0.2 or 0.3 taels of silver per *shi*. This fortune would be huge.

"However," Third Master Zhu turned his tone, "these ships are not to be trifled with. Your brother's group may not be able to handle them. Tell him to pull more people to work together. This fortune is huge! Don't be stingy."

"Yes, slave understands. I'll go back tomorrow morning!"

"No hurry, wait a few days." He stroked Qiuhan's hand. "Maybe there will be ships transporting silver from Guangzhou! But this matter needs long-term planning..."

South China Factory got 50,000 in silver turnover, while the Haiyi Guild made other calculations. In the small Xuwen County, undercurrents surged. All parties prepared for a big gamble with the annual 400,000 or 500,000 taels of South China sugar as the stakes. At this moment, Guangzhou and Lingao, the two important bases of the Transmigration Senate, were also intensely strategizing.

After Wu De rushed back to Lingao, he requested an immediate Executive Committee meeting. At the meeting, the proposal from the Guangzhou Station to absorb retail deposits was passed—the Leizhou sugar affair made them deeply understand the meaning of "Cash is King." Without large amounts of cash, there would be many similar troubles in future market expansion.

Cheng Dong proposed: why not simply set up a financial institution in Guangzhou responsible for absorbing deposits, raising commercial working capital, and conducting remittance business? Financial infiltration into the Great Ming.

"Do you mean opening a bank in Guangzhou?" Ma Qianzhu became nervous.

"Correct, a bank." Cheng Dong nodded. "Of course, what we open can strictly only be considered a *qianzhuang* (money shop) or *piaohao* (draft bank), not worthy of the title 'bank'."

"How to do it?" Everyone was somewhat excited. After all, the word "bank" sounded more imposing than the nondescript grain trading house.

"According to the Guangzhou Station's investigation, this timeline doesn't generally have this type of financial institution yet," Cheng Dong spoke unhurriedly, taking out a rough 'Holy Ship' brand notebook. "There are only money exchange shops, shops dealing in silver and coin exchange. According to the Intelligence Bureau's investigation: besides exchange, these money shops also involve small loans, but they don't absorb deposits. Basically, they profit from currency fluctuations and exchange. The overall capital scale is not large."

What the Finance Committee had its eye on was the remittance business. Simple remittance business existed in the Great Ming, mainly inter-branch remittance between shops to reduce the trouble of transporting physical silver, but the scale was small, mainly meeting the needs of their own shops and industries. An industry dedicated to draft remittance like the *piaohao* had not yet appeared. So this area was a blank slate with great potential.

"The focus of our bank is on remittance, similar to *piaohao* business. After building credit for a few years, silver drafts will be able to circulate everywhere."

Ma Qianzhu shook his head. "The Great Ming doesn't seem to have a huge demand for remittance!" Based on what they had seen and heard, the commodity economy of the Great Ming was just so-so. Although not necessarily primitive, it wasn't that advanced either. The so-called entry into the primary stage of capitalism was far from the truth.

"Not so. Although the scale of capital flow is not large, it exists. Leizhou sugar is an example. We believe that at least for Songjiang cloth, Jiangxi tea and porcelain, Jiangnan silk, and Fujian indigo, there are large-scale flows of silver and money." He took a breath. "Actually, even for this peripheral place of Hainan, according to the Intelligence Bureau's investigation, the annual betel nut and copra trade has a value of several tens of thousands of taels. In terms of scale, this is not small."

The products he listed were mostly very seasonal, and production was often scattered. So whenever the season came, merchants transporting goods needed large amounts of funds for acquisition. The demand for capital circulation would be huge.

Remittance business: First, one can earn remittance fees, i.e., handling charges. Second, based on the fluctuation of silver prices and tightness of money supply in various places, one can obtain profits from interest differentials. As long as physical silver can be turned over, there are many tricks to play inside, creating money out of nothing.

Another purpose for the Finance Committee to run a bank was to establish the credit of their own silver drafts as soon as possible. In the future, the transmigrators' economic, political, and military activities would span the whole country. Whether army, merchants, or intelligence personnel, they couldn't walk around the world carrying handfuls of silver. As for the Lingao Circulation Certificates using a rice standard, it was only a short-term transition. It was impossible and unnecessary to establish credit for circulation nationwide. In comparison, silver drafts were convenient to carry and use.

"Doesn't this equal issuing a new currency again?" Someone questioned. "With Lingao Circulation Certificates, making another silver draft, isn't this too troublesome?"

"This is a misunderstanding. Silver drafts are not currency; at most, they can count as a draft. Although in the late Qing Dynasty people often used silver drafts for direct circulation, the kind of thing in movies where people pull out a handful of silver drafts to pay bills absolutely never happens."

Because silver drafts have different levels of credit. Unlike copper coins and silver ingots—the former is government credit, the latter is real precious metal. Whether a silver draft can stand hard in the market and how wide its effective range is depends largely on the strength and credit of the issuing money shop or draft bank. So some silver drafts only circulate in one place, while others can reach all directions. There are many tricks here. Cheng Dong didn't explain them one by one. He also pointed out that if the credit of silver drafts could be established, there would be huge benefits in capital mobilization and fundraising in the future.

Wu Nanhai still objected, "Soon the Central Plains will be in turmoil. Doing draft remittance definitely involves setting up branches. Investing huge money and manpower, once war starts, won't it all be destroyed?"

"No need," Yan Ming said. "We are not running a modern bank. No need to set up spots everywhere. Just set up spots in a few places where commerce is prosperous and officials gather. When necessary, we can also establish remittance alliances with capable local shops."

The idea of setting up spots was to open up a few key routes. Southwest, Northwest, Central Plains—either poor places or places that would be restless in the future—naturally weren't places to set up spots. The most crucial was the North-South route. Especially from the Capital to Jiangnan. Everyone understood this reason: in the last dozen years of the Ming, Jiangnan was the richest and most peaceful place. Officials in the Capital would inevitably transport large amounts of silver to this paradise to store for future enjoyment. This place was also a major production area for cloth, silk, and tea, with frequent commercial activities.

"Specific cities for branches, first is Southern Zhili," Yan Ming said. "Nanjing, Suzhou, Songjiang. After stabilizing, layout from south to north to Qingjiangpu and Beijing."

Suzhou and Songjiang were the richest in Southern Zhili. The Northern and Southern Capitals were capital cities where officials gathered, so naturally, they had to be prioritized. As for Qingjiangpu, although just a nameless small county town in the 20th century, it was a major wharf where north-south traffic converged in the Ming and Qing dynasties.

At the turn of Ming and Qing, navigating the Grand Canal connecting north and south was difficult through locks, and sailing the Yellow River was dangerous. So travelers going north or south, except for grain transport boats, mostly had to abandon boats and land at Qingjiangpu, go north via the "Thoroughfare of Nine Provinces," cross the Yellow River to Wangjiaying, and take horses or hire carts to go north. Since this place was a transportation hub between north and south, commerce was naturally extremely prosperous. Locally there were also warehouses managed by the Ministry of Revenue and transport shipyards managed by the Ministry of Works, with many important officials like the Governor of Southern River stationed there. Every year the court would send down large sums for river control. The wealth of river officials was famous under heaven. Many officials and many merchants meant frequent flow of silver and money. It was a feng shui treasure land for remittance business.
