# Chapter 491 - New Land Deeds (Part 1)

Yi Fan realized that Cheng Dong didn't mean sheer technical difficulty, but rather human factors—certain high-level figures disliked audits.

"No matter how difficult the department, I will carry the audit through to the end." Yi Fan put on a fearless expression.

Cheng Dong's gaze lingered on his face for a dozen seconds, seemingly studying his attitude. Then he said, "Alright. Everything must have a good start."

After speaking, he stood up and took a file box from the locked cabinet behind him.

"These are some financial documents involving various ministries and commissions. I believe you will find them useful."

Yi Fan took it and noticed nothing was written on the label.

"Take these materials back and study them carefully. They will be very beneficial to your audit work," Cheng Dong said implicitly.

"I understand. Thank you very much." Yi Fan knew these must be materials on financial irregularities of various departments currently held by the Finance Committee. So Cheng Dong had been collecting blackmail material all along. But this was a good thing for him; at least he knew where the problems in each ministry lay and had focal points.

"These aren't blackmail materials." Cheng Dong seemed to see what he was thinking. "These minor irregularities may not count for much, and many weren't done intentionally. But the beginning is most critical. If we don't set the rules well now, it will be hard to manage when the plate gets bigger. So, through this audit, we must eliminate all bad signs."

"You really think far ahead." Yi Fan flattered him subtly.

Cheng Dong smiled, evidently enjoying it.

"I think you should start with the Divine Society under the Agricultural Committee," Cheng Dong said. "Wu Nanhai of the Agricultural Committee is relatively easy to talk to and is an honest person. He will definitely support your work."

"This department should be very easy to audit." Yi Fan felt strange. Picking a soft persimmon first?

"Are you going to audit alone?" Cheng Dong reminded him. "Your subordinates are all rookies."

"Oh, you're right." Yi Fan remembered this point. He didn't have a single person under him. Although he could soon draw students from the National School's accounting training class to fill the ranks, apart from a small amount of accounting knowledge, they were blank slates regarding auditing. He had to teach everything from scratch.

Taking students along and teaching by example through actual audit cases was the most effective training method at this stage. This required a process from easy to difficult—to accumulate experience first.

"I'll send a few professional accountants to help," Cheng Dong said. "But only on temporary loan."

Yi Fan expressed his determination: "I will make sure to clear up these accounts."

With the receding floodwaters, the first large-scale natural disaster encountered by the transmigrator group finally ended. Disaster relief and reconstruction work were arduous, but under the gradually forming modern social management system, no catastrophic events occurred. The losses could largely be recovered.

Grain collection work had reached its final stages before the typhoon arrived, so this year's grain tax didn't suffer major losses. This relieved Wu Mingjin—in recent years, responses from above to requests for tax reduction due to disaster had become increasingly severe; nine times out of ten they were not granted. Now he could at least complete his mission.

Wu De also felt lucky—at least most of the grain produced by local farmers this season had been preserved. If the typhoon had come a few days earlier, the business of contracting the grain tax would have pushed them into a total loss.

But the business was still a bit of a loss: paying for relief grain, exempting "reasonable burdens," paying grain taxes on behalf of disaster-affected households... all in all, the transmigrator group lost about a thousand *shi* of brown rice this season. As for reconstruction expenses, they were also a considerable figure.

The original plan to make a huge profit by taking advantage of cheap rice and expensive silver in Lingao versus expensive rice and cheap silver in Leizhou during the Liaodong Surcharge collection also went bankrupt. After the disaster, rice prices in Lingao rose extremely fast. Earning the Liaodong Surcharge through speculation was probably impossible.

"Now we only have to speed up land surveying and implement the new tax system next year," Wu De said. "Once taxable land increases and we change the tax system, it will be easier to handle."

Wen Desi said, "But the immediate problem isn't solved. What about this extra levy of over ten thousand taels for the Liaodong Surcharge? Are we supposed to bear it?"

"Continuing to collect is a bit difficult," Wu De said. "I spoke with Wang Zhaomin and also learned some things from the retained Household Office personnel. Collecting the Liaodong Surcharge was already quite strenuous. With the flood this year, collecting it will probably be even harder."

"I think we should pay it," Wu De said. "Give the common people a chance to recuperate. The group can manage paying over ten thousand taels on their behalf."

"Big loss, big loss." Cheng Dong shook his head repeatedly.

"We should treat this matter as a government, not as merchants," Wu De said. "If a government only wants to make money and not lose any, treating the people and the country as business objects, can it run well? A rich state and poor people is a sign of a dying nation."

Yu Eshui said, "The ancients commented long ago: Emperor Wen of Sui and his son didn't pity the people but pitied the granaries. The second generation perished, and the granaries full of cloth and grain came cheap for the Li family."

"I agree with that, but we currently lack a proper title. We're still wearing the Great Ming's hat. I'm afraid if we do this good deed, the common people will credit it to the Zhu Emperor, and we'll lose out big time."

"Let Ding Ding publicize it with great fanfare," Wu De said. "The people are reasonable. Moreover, Lingao is our base area. At critical times like this, we must give the people some benefits so they will follow us resolutely."

"We pay this year, but what about next year?" Cheng Dong raised a question. "We have to maintain this state for at least several years. What about the Liaodong Surcharge for these few years, and the increasing extra levies in the future?"

"As long as we implement the new tax reform and the agricultural promotion plan, obtaining these from Lingao itself won't be difficult." Wu De was very confident after his recent investigations. "Let's treat this as a loan to Lingao to let it restore its blood-making function."

Finally, following Wu De's request, it was decided that the transmigrator group would pay this year's Liaodong Surcharge on behalf of the people. The transmigrator group certainly had silver, but not to the extent that they could pay such a huge sum casually. This decision caused heartache for many.

Having reached this point, Wu De had no way back; the land survey had to be completed quickly and well. As soon as he returned to the Grain Collection Bureau office, he immediately held a meeting to urge the progress of the land survey, dispatching work teams to conduct field measurements of villages where declarations had ended. At the same time, more propaganda teams regrouped and began a new round of propaganda offensives.

After Fu Buer finished his self-declaration, he received a return receipt. He was notified that field measurements and mapping of his declared land would follow, after which new land deeds would be issued.

Among the few landlord households in Meiyang Village, his declaration was the most thorough. He didn't leave out a single fen of land. This wasn't because his awareness was particularly high, but because he was the only one who had truly seen the full power of the Australians, and thus understood their capability better than others.

The other households invariably successfully adopted the strategy of reporting part and hiding part. Some reported only paddy fields and not garden plots. Some reported only the parts with deeds and not the reclaimed parts; others reported whole blocks of fields but not fragmented corner plots... As for the village's richest man, Fu Yousan, he only reported his registered land with deeds. He believed the hidden fields in the mountain col were safe enough.

Fu Yousan even specially sent people to deliver many daily necessities, telling his second son and the tenants at the farmstead not to come to the village recently to avoid trouble with the Australians.

Ordinary people either had very little land or were tenant farmers, so naturally, they didn't bother with such thoughts.

In this atmosphere, the survey work team arrived in Meiyang Village.

The scale of the surveying and mapping work team was surprisingly large, even exceeding the work teams that went to the countryside during the bandit suppression period. There were not only surveying professionals but also draftspeople—both transmigrators and trainees. Ox carts brought a full set of professional equipment, along with assigned security personnel. A mighty contingent exceeding 100 people.

The commander of this team was Wang Ruixiang. Of course, he knew nothing about surveying—it was normal for leaders not to understand the profession. He knew mechanics, drafting, had high combat value, spoke loudly enough, and could act fierce to intimidate natives—all this added up was enough to lead this work team.

Because there were so many people and they brought a lot of equipment, the work wouldn't end in the short term. The work team set up a temporary camp directly in the open space outside the village. Eight hours later, a camp surrounded by barbed wire and equipped with modular guard towers was completed. The blades of wind power generator sets spun in the air, attracting onlookers from the village.

Of course, such a grand scale and investment were not purely to serve Meiyang Village. Besides Meiyang Village, it also had to cover the six or seven surrounding villages. Therefore, the work team was rarely equipped with four-wheeled agricultural vehicles to work in more distant areas.

After the work team settled down, they immediately conducted field measurements and mapping of each family's land. This measurement and mapping used the new weights and measures system entirely. *Mu* was uniformly calculated as 667 square meters, while length and width distances were all calculated using the metric system.

Land verification work was quite complex. Not only did they have to check the area and location of land declared by each family, but those with old deeds also had to be compared against them to avoid misreporting—this wasn't even the most troublesome part. No matter how inaccurate the old deeds were, they at least provided a basic reference. The large amount of unregistered, deedless land was the real mess. During field verification, the work team found multiple people claiming the same piece of land or overlapping claims. Property disputes even popped up, with people crying injustice and fighting right there in the camp. For this reason, the work team acted as civil judges, urgently transferring several people from the "Law Club" to assist. Some people couldn't even clearly state the specific location of their land, confusing one for another; others reported wrong areas—all sorts of things. The camp was bustling with noise every day, like a beehive.
