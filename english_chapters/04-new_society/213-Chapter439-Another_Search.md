# Chapter 439 Another Search

"Fine, if we catch the father, the son can't run away either," Ran Yao said. "But don't get your hopes up. If I were Gou Er, I'd have run far away long ago."

Lin Baiguang's thinking differed from Ran Yao's. The point of issuing a warrant for Gou Er and his son wasn't just to catch them—in fact, the likelihood of catching them wasn't high. It was a matter of attitude. The Transmigrators had to clear their name for the bloodbath at Gou Family Manor. This hadn't been done in the past, so now they had to make up for it quickly.

Finding Gou Er's treasure obviously couldn't be achieved just by catching people. Lin Baiguang thought for a moment and called Mu Min, asking if she was interested in participating in the search of Gou Er's residence—Mu Min had done five years of criminal investigation work and should have professional experience in searches.

"Search?" Mu Min was surprised. When they raided Gou Er's residence last year, she hadn't participated because her status wasn't determined yet. But she had heard the place was turned upside down. What could they find by searching again?

Early the next morning, Lin Baiguang and Mu Min took several native team members into the city. Xiong Buyou had already told the county jail warden about searching Gou Er's house. The warden naturally agreed readily and brought a few yamen runners to wait.

Gou Er's house was in the North Guanxiang area of the county town. Lingao's North Gate had been blocked up long ago, so this North Guanxiang was very desolate, with no shops and scattered households. It was perfect for someone like Gou Er who engaged in shady dealings.

A small door opened in a black water-stained wall, sealed with the Lingao County Yamen's strip—ever since the Gou Family Manor was destroyed, the Lingao County Yamen had sent people to seal the house. Wu Mingjin didn't care much for the Gou family either. As soon as the Gou Family Manor was finished, he secretly cheered. Right after the Australians finished searching Gou Er's house, he had people seal it up to show official authority.

The warden ordered men to remove the seal, gave a few instructions, and left with his men, leaving only one runner to keep watch.

Inside the door was a small courtyard connected to a hallway. Grass had already grown between the paving bricks. Passing through the courtyard, they reached the main building. The doors and windows of the three main rooms were wide open, a scene of devastation. Rotten paper, rags, unraveled bamboo curtains, smashed pots and jars, and dismantled furniture were scattered everywhere. It looked as if it had been looted. Anything slightly decent had vanished without a trace. This kind of violent search wasn't the Transmigrators' style; obviously, the yamen runners hadn't cared about their former *jianghu* friendship with Gou Er and had thoroughly scavenged the place.

Gou Er's residence wasn't large; it had the layout of an ordinary well-off household in the county town. Lin Baiguang and Mu Min led people to search every room carefully but found nothing special, like hidden compartments or secret rooms—there was a hidden compartment in Gou Er's study, but it had long been smashed open and was empty. Lin Baiguang remembered the report stating that apart from some scattered silver and a dagger, nothing else was found in the study's hidden compartment.

Mu Min couldn't help but say: "Why do you insist that Gou Er hid something in his own home and didn't take it? For such important things, shouldn't he have carried them with him when fleeing for his life?"

"Attributes our attack on Gou Family Manor was a sudden action, and we almost captured him alive on the road," Lin Baiguang said. "He reacted very quickly—so quickly that when we went to the county to catch him the next day, he was already gone. Not only was he gone, but the important valuables in the house were gone too. These things couldn't be moved in such a hurry, so I conclude the things are still in the house."

"That's not necessarily true," Mu Min said. "According to our investigation of the county at the time, after D-Day, rich people in the county, guarding against our attacking the city, moved valuables and fine soft goods to relatives and friends in the countryside one after another. Gou Er would be no exception."

"That possibility exists, but what I want isn't his gold and silver. It's the documents and letters in his hands," Lin Baiguang said. "Compared to gold, silver, and jewelry, these things concern his life and the capital for his rise. How could he easily entrust them to others? Either he carried them with him—but he couldn't take everything, so surely a part is hidden somewhere."

"What you say makes sense." Mu Min thought for a moment. "Let's search one more time. Consider it an internship for the kids." She smiled. "To be honest, the last search might not have been very careful."

Saying this, she took out some equipment from her kit bag—knowing she was to search Gou Er's house again, she had specially requisitioned equipment and called her two "apprentices." She had taken two young interns from the Military and Political School specifically to learn criminal investigation from her. One of them was Wu Xiang, who had a deep hatred for bandits—he was chosen for this reason.

"I think we should start with the study. This should be the key point, followed by the bedroom," Lin Baiguang suggested.

Mu Min shook her head: "Normally, these two locations are most likely to hide important household items. But if fleeing, neither place is very likely—because everyone would think of them. Wasn't that hidden compartment found?"

"Where do you think is more likely?"

"I'm not very clear on the ancients' hiding patterns, but buried caches should be more common. Digging a pit to bury important things."

"Hmm." Lin Baiguang thought it best to let her judge such professional questions.

"Pay attention to searching the square bricks on the ground. Check for signs of prying." Mu Min instructed the two interns. "Knock on the square bricks and listen for hollow sounds."

Panel walls and the like had already been split open by greedy runners, so there was nothing inside. Gou Er's house, like most traditional southern dwellings, had no ceiling, so nothing could be hidden on the beams either. The most likely place was under the brick floor of the house.

Others also helped. Lin Baiguang worked for a while but found it particularly boring, so he went out to smoke. He hadn't expected criminal investigation work to be so dull and tedious; he had originally thought it would be exciting. It seemed his job in enemy work was right for him—at least it was more interesting.

They searched all morning without any discoveries. Someone found a small cellar under the original bed position in the bedroom, but lifting the square bricks revealed it was empty.

Several similar small hiding places missed last time were also found. One contained knives and spears, and others held several sets of clothes and utensils—outfits for wandering Taoist priests, peddlers carrying loads, and beggars, probably prepared for disguise and escape in emergencies.

But none contained what they wanted. Lin Baiguang felt very dejected. He had thought he could find something. Did he really have to arrest Gou Er's relatives? First would be Gou Er's father-in-law's family, then Gou Er's in-laws by his son's marriage. Gou Er's clan relatives were all at Gou Family Manor; apart from them, these two families were most closely related to him.

The problem was that according to the Social Work Department's investigation, Gou Er had a very bad relationship with his son's in-laws—his son Gou Chengxuan had forced the marriage, and that family felt deeply ashamed of this relative, having almost no dealings with them. It was impossible for them to hide things.

That left only Gou Er's own in-laws. Lin Baiguang checked the records; this family lived dozens of *li* away from the county town and were local small landholders who were fairly submissive to the Crossing Group. Asking them to honestly hand over treasure was probably impossible, but openly raiding their home seemed to lack a suitable reason...

Walking aimlessly to the backyard with a cigarette in his mouth, the backyard was desolate, with nothing but weeds covering the ground. There was a tall kapok tree in the yard, full of bright red kapok flowers, attracting Lin Baiguang's gaze for a few moments.

Only then did he notice that not far from the tree, there seemed to be the stone enclosure of a well. He hurried over. The well was covered with a lid. Lifting the lid and looking down, it was very deep and dark. Lin Baiguang's heart stirred—a water well was also a good place to hide things! Didn't the tunnel entrances in *Tunnel Warfare* lie in well walls? He pulled out his powerful American police flashlight and shone it carefully around the well walls, hoping to find a trace.

The well was deep, its walls built of blue bricks. Over the years, they were covered with moss. There were no facilities for climbing up or down on the walls, nor any traces of anyone having climbed—the moss was thick and showed no signs of being worn away.

He was slightly disappointed; it didn't look like there were any tricks. After looking for a long time, Mu Min brought her people over and began carpet-searching the backyard.

"Let's put it this way: we've searched every searchable place," Mu Min said with a smile. "We even dismantled the stove in the kitchen, still nothing."

"Same here. There's a well here. I thought I could find something, but it was empty." Lin Baiguang sighed.

Mu Min took the flashlight and looked carefully. She also found nothing unusual. Just as she was about to leave the well platform, she suddenly froze, staring intently at the stone ring of the well curb.

"What is it?"

"There's something wrong here!" Mu Min was somewhat excited, pointing at the stone ring. "See that? Traces of being hit."

Lin Baiguang followed her finger and looked carefully. Sure enough: on the stone rail, there were some pitted marks and traces of dragging and abrasion—the traces were relatively fresh, not left from long ago.

"What is this?"

"These traces show that someone once dragged something very heavy over the well curb. This thing was very hard, hard enough to knock dents into the stone well curb."

"What could it be?" Lin Baiguang's mood lifted.

"Don't know. Probably ironware. Weapons?" Mu Min said. "Whatever it is, it was likely thrown into the well. The drag marks prove it." She peered at the depth of the well. "We need to find a hook or something..."

She threw a pebble in and watched the splash under the flashlight beam: "Very deep. Ordinary hooks probably won't work; need something longer and heavier."

"It must be the treasure!" Lin Baiguang saw light before his eyes. "Forget grappling iron. Pump the water directly."
