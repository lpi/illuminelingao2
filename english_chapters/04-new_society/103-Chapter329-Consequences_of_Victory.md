# Chapter 329 - Consequences of Victory

Xin Nari once again displayed his intelligence and wit; instead of running from the village entrance, he jumped directly into a small river by the village and swam to safety.

During the entire operation, besides the Work Team itself, the Executive Committee also deployed a bandit suppression detachment for support. In fact, most soldiers didn't even get a chance to fire before the battle ended. Du Wen and Dong Weiwei kept straight faces in front of outsiders, but were actually blooming with joy inside—this was a complete victory, and under their own direct management!

After this battle, the deadlock in Daolu Village was completely broken. This victory not only eliminated the bandit gang but also used the opportunity to purge the family power of several bandit leaders who had entrenched themselves in the Thirteen Villages area for a long time. The work in Daolu Village progressed a thousand *li* in a day. The militia unit Du Wen had longed for was quickly organized, work on the earth wall started, and the village administration that had faced obstacles everywhere instantly turned into a great situation where "the whole village obeys orders, none dare to disobey." Like dominoes, after one fell, a total chain reaction occurred. The Work Team's activities in other areas of Thirteen Villages suddenly met no resistance and proceeded very smoothly.

Du Wen unceremoniously exercised the "Iron Fist of Dictatorship," first sweeping away the bandit families in the village—the blue cloth strips hanging on doors became the best identification marks. Regardless of gender or age, those not killed were all tied into strings with ropes and escorted back to Bairen City by the detachment—coolies were urgently needed there.

"Taking the children too?" asked the officer responsible for transporting the prisoners.

"Of course, take them all. Ask the Executive Committee about specific handling when you get back." Du Wen was happy to conduct a thorough cleaning, removing all guys she considered problematic. As for how to handle the children, let Wen Desi rack his brain.

Du Wen originally intended to handle all bandit families in the Thirteen Villages area this way but was stopped by Dong Weiwei: "They didn't participate in the riot. Let's not drive them to extremes; leave people a way out."

"Cutting grass requires removing the roots! The families of such bad elements are full of bad water; they will all be factors of social instability in the future..."

"Unnecessary, and it loses too much popular support," Dong Weiwei insisted. "History tells us that engaging in campaign-style expansion and implicating nine generations only backfires."

"But without settling accounts, boundless leniency is harmful." Less than five minutes after hugging for victory, the two women started a new round of arguments.

Finally, both sides reached a compromise. Du Wen began to spare no effort in promoting the "Enter Village, Enter Household, Check Roots, Dig Sources, Everyone Must Pass" movement in every village. Every day, she took the newly formed Daolu Village militia and some guards to various villages: holding meetings, organizing militias, cleaning up household registries, ordering bandits who fled home and bandit families to register and surrender, and investigating valuables and grain hidden by bandit families.

Because the other villages didn't participate in Xin Nari's counterattack and had no other associations with the bandits, the final handling was much lighter than in Daolu Village. Only a few bandits with blood debts were settled. Ordinary bandits, as long as they handed over looted Valuables and grain and signed a letter of guarantee, were let off. Then it was announced at the whole village assembly: those who had minor experiences of following bandits or helping bandits transport stolen goods in the past, as long as they didn't participate in this counterattack and had incurred no public wrath, were all granted amnesty; money and grain distributed in the past didn't need to be returned either—what these people obtained was limited, and since it was years ago, investigating would be endless and detrimental to quickly stabilizing people's hearts.

Sending Dong Weiwei as vice-captain was indeed a wise decision. Although Dong Weiwei constantly argued with Du Wen on specific matters, she effectively lowered Du Wen's enthusiasm for engaging in big mass movements. Generally speaking, things proceeded relatively gently and orderly without causing any extreme incidents. Wu De, who originally had reservations about sending two women to run the Work Team, now prostrated himself in admiration of Ma Qianzhu.

"The Lord Superintendent is indeed the Lord Superintendent," he said in the farm bar.

Regarding the confiscated houses, fields, and property, Du Wen originally wanted to take the opportunity to carry out a small-scale land reform and distribute land. But this matter was intercepted by the special commissioner sent by the Planning Committee.

"These are all spoils of war for the transmigrators. How to handle them must be discussed and decided by the Executive Committee."

"Flies!" Du Wen muttered aggressively disatisfied. Although the Planning Committee was responsible to the most beloved Commissioner Ma, the people under him really lacked appeal to most people. Whether distributing materials normally or receiving materials after battles, this group exerted the characteristic of haggling over every penny—and they could always appear at every location with major gains at the fastest speed.

Digging three feet into the ground in the village yielded quite a few valuables, though not much grain. The Planning Committee left a portion for the Work Team to conduct relief in the village. Every household in the village was issued some grain and silver money. Families harmed by bandits or who had members died received extra pension silver.

Lu Ruohua made big signs of the cross on the street and led people to collect corpses, wearing a face of compassion for the world. However, he was the greatest contributor to this victory. During a routine confession, Old Lady Mei revealed the matter of Zhao Dachong meeting the couple to ask about the Work Team's situation, and finally mentioned Zhao Dachong wanting Old Man Mei to be a spy.

Knowing the matter was grave, Lu Ruohua called Bai Duolu over to discuss. Logically, the content of a confession could not be revealed to a third party, but the Jesuits had long received exemptions in this regard. Bai Duolu hurriedly reported this intelligence to Dong Weiwei.

That night, the Work Team called Old Man Mei in for questioning. The scared-to-death Old Man Mei quickly spilled everything. Based on the news provided by Old Man Mei, everyone unanimously speculated that the bandit gang was about to launch a counterattack.

At that time, Dong Weiwei telegraphed Bairen City, requesting the deployment of a bandit suppression detachment for support, to surround and annihilate them in one stroke if possible. At this time, a Work Team member reported Liu Si's abnormal state recently: distracted, often hiding in the ancestral hall, and too lazy to go to Widow Zhou's house where he used to help often. Linking this with the news obtained from Old Man Mei, the two women knew Liu Si definitely had a problem.

How could Liu Si, a country bumpkin, be a match for cunning and shrewd modern people? Covered by Du Wen's half-true, half-false words, plus half-baked body language reading learned from FBI body language studies, Liu Si thought the matter was completely exposed—originally he wasn't willing to be a bandit either. Under Du Wen's "patient guidance," Liu Si knelt on the ground crying bitterly and repenting, confessing everything, even admitting that his mass work was actually picking up girls. Du Wen, who always looked down on people engaging in promiscuous relationships, wanted to kick him in the crotch right then and give him a "permanent expulsion from the Party." But under Dong Weiwei's strong persuasion, she finally decided to let Liu Si "atone for crimes by rendering meritorious service"—after all, it was a good opportunity to play the game of *Infernal Affairs* (double agent).

Of course, for Liu Si, this merit wasn't so easy to render. But Du Wen promised: after the bandit suppression succeeded, she wouldn't pursue his womanizing matters anymore and guaranteed not to record the matter in his personal file.

As for the bribed valuables, they naturally had to be turned over to the public. Liu Si dared not argue and had to honestly play his role as a double agent.

After the enemy-luring operation succeeded, Liu Si also received a reward. Du Wen called him for a private talk:

"Little Liu, although you made mistakes this time, your attitude is good." Du Wen paused, and Liu Si quickly stood up. "Thank you to the organization for trusting me! I will definitely correct my past mistakes and make persistent efforts to contribute to the great cause of transmigration..."

"Alright, alright." Du Wen waved her hand. "Your matter, merit offsets faults. As said before, it won't be pursued anymore. However, you must give an explanation to Widow Zhou. Just have the wedding. Always sneaking around has a bad influence on the masses!"

"Yes, I'll pick an auspicious day..." He stopped immediately; Chief Du hated these things the most.

"Picking a day is fine too." Du Wen was in a good mood and didn't fuss about these things. "Also, the organization has researched and decided. Since you married a local woman, just stay here for local work. Daolu Village is a new area; you will serve as the Village Head!"

"Thank you to the organization for the promotion and important assignment!" Liu Si stood up excitedly. If kowtowing wasn't out of fashion with the Australians, he probably would have knocked his head a few times.

"Work hard in the future. Get the work in Daolu Village done well first, and then we will gradually expand to other villages." The situation in Thirteen Villages was excellent right now. The Work Team's next focus was social investigation; they wouldn't have time to interfere in specific village affairs. Handing it to Liu Si shouldn't be a big problem.

However, amidst the many excellent situations, there was a sequela that dissatisfied Du Wen: the number of baptized people increased greatly. from the original Mei couple to the whole village scrambling to go to the church to hear reason and get baptized. Lu Ruohua was so happy he thanked God every night. He also looked at Bai Duolu with new eyes. Bai Duolu was miserable; he was now "bombed" by Father Lu every day, asking him to vow to become a monk.

"With your talent, piety to the Lord, and contribution to spreading the Gospel, the future Archbishop of Guangdong Diocese can be none other than you, plus holding the posts of abbot for several wealthy monasteries..."

Bai Duolu thought: *In the past, President Wen wanted me to be the Bishop of Lingao; now Lu Ruohua says the Archbishop of Guangdong is none other than me. Is the Pope planning to award me a red hat in the future? No, if I really wear a red hat, according to the thinking mode of Wen Desi and his ilk, they will definitely spare no effort to make me Pope...* Thinking of this, Bai Duolu felt guilty for a moment, but also yearned for it a little. Then he thought that becoming a clergy member meant no wife—other things were negotiable, but this could absolutely not be agreed to.

In the days when Du Wen engaged in clearing bandit trouble, causing panic and making every family uneasy, Lu Ruohua seized the opportunity to enter various villages in the region to preach the Gospel. This time, he was no longer alone—although the believers in Daolu Village were not very clear about the basic doctrines, they had already opened the way for his missionary career. A group of middle-aged and elderly women wearing crosses around their necks followed Father Lu, adopting the method of sweeping streets house by house, engaging in a "Everyone Listens to the Gospel" mass movement style of evangelism.

"Everyone must go deep into every household, to the fields and ground heads, to spread the Lord's Gospel to every lost lamb," Lu Ruohua said to a group of middle-aged and elderly women with extremely pious eyes, carrying bags full of missionary leaflets.

His mission group followed behind Du Wen's ass, active everywhere leveraging the remaining prestige of the transmigrators. Many people, in order to quickly establish a relationship with the Transmigration Group, ran to Lu Ruohua's place to ask for baptism without even figuring out what the Lord and the Virgin Mary were. The catechism class was overcrowded every day, simply holding classes in the courtyard. Bai Duolu's voice was almost hoarse. Once mass-produced believers were baptized, they quickly asked for a cross to hang around their necks; some simply took several, hanging one on the gate too. The crosses Lu Ruohua brought with him were quickly gone. He hurriedly wrote back to Macau to order a large batch.

Du Wen was furious and wanted to expel this foreign monk several times to draw a clear line. But it was undeniable that the foreign monk preaching doctrines like "forgiveness" and "benevolence" played a role in stabilizing society. Under Dong Weiwei's persuasion, she finally endured it. Besides, the swarming missionary personnel were mostly middle-aged and elderly women; she couldn't conveniently order people to use force.

During this Great Leap Forward in evangelism, Lu Ruohua also developed the first batch of "nuns": some solitary middle-aged and elderly women who wanted to leave home to cultivate the afterlife after this turmoil. There were no big temples in Lingao locally, and even nunneries were few. This newly appeared foreign religion came at the right time. The foreign monk spoke gently, sang nice songs, and had many beautiful pictures—Lu Ruohua tore out advertisement pages from real estate ads that Bai Duolu used to wrap books. After he described Heaven and resurrection, some people asked to become "foreign nuns."

Lu Ruohua simply took them in, temporarily counting them as church staff. At least miscellaneous chores like cleaning the church, cooking, and washing clothes would be done by someone.

That day, Lu Ruohua called Bai Duolu.

"Has your monastery been established?"

Bai Duolu was tongue-tied. The so-called Australian Church was fundamentally air. Where would a monastery come from? He had to make excuses: "There is no monastery locally yet."

"Establish one. There are many lambs here who want to choose the path of serving the Lord for life." Lu Ruohua crossed himself. "Please go discuss it with He Ying."

After receiving Bai Duolu's telegram, He Ying dared not neglect. This matter involved future ecclesiastical authority, so he hurried to find the Executive Committee for instructions.

"What do you think?" Wen Desi asked He Ying back.

If based on He Ying's social experience in the other timeline, he would definitely say: "My view is the same as yours." But there was no need for that here.

"Do it," He Ying said. "After this bandit suppression, there must be many bandit orphans left in various villages. We can't kill these children, but keeping them to educate ourselves is a trouble. Why not let the monastery adopt and raise them? It doesn't waste resources and can conveniently brainwash them. Controlling them with Hell after death—isn't that more effective than us using knives and guns? It kills two birds with one stone."
