# Chapter 321 - Nick's Career (Part 2)

As time passed, the material conditions of the farm gradually improved. Nick's horse breeding career also began to flourish. The farm rebuilt permanent stables according to horse breeding requirements, established a dedicated water supply system for horses, and fenced off a small piece of land as a paddock for horses to move freely.

To solve the problem of concentrated feed, he visited the Planning Committee several times and received permission to include the purchase or requisition of oats, alfalfa, and other legumes and miscellaneous grains in the procurement list. Wu Nanhai also promised to include these feed varieties in the planting plan. Throughout the winter, he was busy finding suitable feed for the horses. To let them breed in spring, he had to fatten up the stallions and mares—feeding them only grass would merely keep them alive.

Fortunately, after capturing Gou Family Village, there were many miscellaneous grains in the seized provisions. Nick treasured them like gems. He pestered Ma Qianzhu for a whole day and finally got his hands on all bean varieties except soybeans, mung beans, and red beans—including the bean dregs left over from future tofu making, which he also told Wu Nanhai to count as horse feed.

"I wanted to feed the pigs with that," Wu Nanhai felt it was a waste.

"Feeding horses or pigs are both wasteful. There are few dishes we can make now; I'll make stir-fried bean dregs for everyone, it counts as a dish too," said Auntie Tian, who presided over the cafeteria work.

"Let's forget about that," Wu Nanhai said. "It'd be a wonder if everyone didn't curse us to death."

"It's not untasty. Stir-fry it with sheep fat or lard, add some green garlic, it smells delicious..." Auntie Tian gestured, "Snowflake Dish!"

"We lack animal fat. That stuff relies on oil to bring out the flavor. Otherwise, who would eat dry bean dregs?"

Nick said: "Pigs can't pull carts. Besides, we don't need pig cavalry."

"Fine, I give up," Wu Nanhai conceded. "It's yours."

Thanks to the supplementation of miscellaneous grains and tofu dregs, the condition of the horse herd was very good throughout the winter—and the herd had expanded. Through purchase and capture, Nick's stable now housed twenty-five horses. A large portion of them were already capable of handling daily labor, whether pulling carts or driving animal-powered machinery.

*Although Wu Nanhai is average in every professional field, he is indeed a good leader,* Nick thought. *At least he listens to everyone's opinions and ideas, ignoring no one—including the long-term worker foremen on the farm.*

The gate to the paddock outside the stable was closed. Inside, several teenagers wearing gray military uniforms were taking care of the horses. Seeing Nick return, these half-grown lads gathered around.

"Chief Ni, why won't this horse listen to me?"

"I want to wash the horse's hooves, but what if the horse won't let me grab its hoof?"

"How do I clean the hair off the horse brush?"

"Chief, the horse kicked me..." Someone was even "wounded in action."

They wore the red collar tabs of the artillery, cadets of the artillery unit. According to regulations, Army artillery cadets had to take one day off every week to take turns serving in the farm stables: washing horses, learning hoof trimming, shoeing, walking horses, etc. These cadets greatly reduced Nick's burden, allowing him to focus his main energy on horse training, establishing pedigrees, and breeding management.

"Don't rush, speak slowly."

Nick calmed everyone down and asked a boy working in the stable to lead Da Tie back to the stable first. When talking about horses, Nick was always radiant.

"Washing horse hooves requires the technique of grabbing the hoof," Nick said. "Little Tartar, you come and brush 'Celeron's' hoof."

These horses collected from this timeline were all named after Intel and AMD processors. The natives just couldn't figure out why a perfectly good horse wasn't called "Sai Hu" (Rivalling Tiger) or "Sai Long" (Rivalling Dragon), but had to be called "Sai Yang" (Celeron/Rivalling Sheep). Could it be that Australian sheep ran very fast?

"Yes!" Little Tartar answered loudly and led "Celeron" over.

Little Tartar's formal name was Da Shi. He wasn't a Mongol; he claimed his ancestral home was Henan. After his hometown suffered a disaster, he wandered all the way to Guangdong. Just because his hair was a bit curly, he was given this nickname by the cadets of the same term.

Little Tartar was short. Following Nick's instructions, he lifted the horse's front leg to waist height, gritted his teeth, and held it up with both hands. He didn't expect to complete it so smoothly. Just as Nick demonstrated, he used his left hand to grab the horse hoof and rest it on his knee. But as soon as his hand loosened, the hoof slipped off his knee. Little Tartar quickly jumped away, looking worried about being kicked.

"Don't be afraid," Nick reminded him. "Your method of holding the hoof is wrong. Try the opposite direction."

He tried grabbing in the opposite direction, and indeed it was much firmer than before. He held the brush in his right hand and brushed the dirt from inside the hoof. Every time the brush touched the hoof, the horse would move its leg from time to time. Whenever this happened, Little Tartar's face would tense up. Finally, he pulled over an iron bucket filled with water and used a scrubbing brush to clean the sole of the horse's foot as well.

"Remember to hold the horse's leg firmly when scrubbing. If you let go in the middle, it will step on your foot or fly into a rage."

After washing the horse's foot, he applied hoof oil to the hoof according to Nick's instructions. This little bit of hoof oil was only obtained after Nick applied to Wu Nanhai for half a day.

"Good, now wash the hind legs too," Nick said.

Little Tartar hesitated: "Will it kick me? A horse kick from the hind leg can be fatal..."

"Don't be afraid. I'm watching," Nick reassured him.

The hind legs were more terrifying than the front legs. Little Tartar grabbed the left hind leg with both hands and tried to lift it but didn't succeed. However, the horse didn't kick him, which slightly eased his mind. So he tried again with force, and this time he lifted it quite easily.

But cleaning was still very strenuous. Whenever the hoof was about to slide off him, he would use force to lift it again. With great difficulty, he finally cleaned all four legs. Little Tartar was sweating all over.

"Good job," Nick praised, although it took a bit long.

"Horses are very precious and useful animals. To make them serve you, you must take good care of them, understand?"

"Yes, Chief!" The future artillerymen answered in unison.

Nick then guided the others for a while, inspected the horses exercising in the paddock to see if their condition was normal, and then returned to the stable.

The tall stable was one of the landmark buildings of the farm. Not only did the local natives click their tongues in wonder when they saw it, but even the transmigrators were full of curiosity about this building. The entire building was a brick-and-wood structure, long and narrow, with a high pointed roof. Ventilation and lighting were very good. The floors of the double-row stables were all compacted lime-sand-clay mixture. The bedding straw was changed daily to ensure the cleanliness of the stable—lacking veterinary drugs, they had to strengthen hygiene measures to ensure the horses got sick less or not at all. Yang Baogui also sprinkled lime daily on the ground at the entrance and exit of the stable as a simple disinfection measure.

Since the number of horses increased, Nick also had more hands under him. He despised the people Wu De found among the immigrant natives who claimed to have horse-raising experience as ignorant; many of their horse-raising methods were completely wrong. So he simply didn't want any of them.

"Correcting mistakes is harder than starting from scratch on a blank sheet of paper."

So Nick only selected two fourteen or fifteen-year-old half-grown boys named Sheng Bao and Lai Bao from the children of employees assigned to the farm to help. These two children had gone through literacy classes and were now formally his apprentices.

He instructed Sheng Bao to give "Da Tie" water and add feed. The breeding stallion had to have semen collected twice a day, so it particularly needed rich nutrition. For this, he specially obtained specific feed rations of eggs and millet from Wu Nanhai. Eggs were to replenish protein, and as for millet, it had a good effect on improving the stallion's libido and semen quality.

Lai Bao brought fresh water from outside. Nick taught him hand-in-hand how to clean "Da Tie's" genitals, especially scrubbing the testicles with cold water—this was taught to him by Yang Baogui, said to be beneficial for semen secretion.

"Da Tie" was a breeding stallion they had high hopes for. As a Tieling draft horse, it had the blood of many world-class breeds flowing in its veins, including Ardennes, Anglo-Norman, Percheron, Anglo-Arabian, etc. It was an excellent draft horse. It had extremely important significance for the transmigrators' future agriculture, military, and road transport. Besides mating it with the Tieling mare, Yang Baogui also planned to use it for crossbreeding with Dian mares.

After cleaning "Da Tie" and instructing his apprentices on matters to pay attention to, Nick hurriedly returned to his room, preparing to rest for a few hours. He had been exhausted recently: getting up at 3 AM to feed horses, feeding the last fodder at 9 PM, serving horses, teaching apprentices, collecting and processing feed, doing administration... he had almost no free hour.

There was a permanent smell of horse manure in the room, but Nick didn't mind at all. Because he was too tired, didn't want to bathe, and feared dirtying the sheets, he laid a straw pallet at the door and slept directly on it, changing it every other day. Wu Nanhai joked that Nick was also like a horse now.

He woke up after sleeping for less than two hours. There were many things to do during the breeding season, so generally, he dared not sleep too soundly. Looking at his watch, it was approaching noon. His stomach growled with hunger. He got up, dusted off the straw stalks from his body, poured some clear water from an earthen jar into a basin to wash his face, and prepared to go to the canteen for lunch.

Suddenly the phone rang; it was Yang Baogui calling.

"Come to the Lotus Pavilion for lunch, Wu Nanhai is treating."

The Lotus Pavilion was a dedicated venue for "corruption" (feasting) in the Demonstration Farm. Beside it was a small lake now planted full of lotus roots, so everyone called it that.

"Why treat for no reason?"

"It's not treating you; it's asking you to be an accompanying guest. By the way, this matter has a huge relationship with your horse breeding career. You must come!" Yang Baogui hung up after speaking.

*Huge relationship with horse breeding career?* Nick couldn't make heads or tails of it.

Arriving at the Lotus Pavilion, he saw that the guest invited was actually Civil Affairs Commissioner Wu De. Once the conversation started at the table, Nick realized that Yang Baogui had designs on Damei Village.

Speaking of which, this idea had existed for a long time. In his few months of horse breeding practice, Nick also knew that the overall climate and environment of Lingao were not quite suitable for horses. Moreover, the space was too narrow. Currently, only the open areas on both banks of the Wenlan River were suitable for grazing and walking horses, but these areas had either been reclaimed as farmland or were included in the agricultural department's future reclamation plans. Reserving large tracts of land for horse breeding was unlikely—planting crops was the top priority after all, and grain output was directly related to the scale of horse breeding.

Although stall feeding combined with heavy use of silage and concentrated feed could raise horses at a fairly high density in the existing space, the climate conditions here were too hot and humid, which would be very detrimental to horse health in summer. Furthermore, the long adaptation period of sensitive creatures like horses to strange environments was also a headache. Horses obviously wouldn't have much "sexual interest" in places where they felt unhappy or uncomfortable, so the natural reproduction rate was also low. This was why Yang Baogui was anxious to engage in artificial insemination.

Yang Baogui had gone to the Gaoshan Ridge area several times after the New Year just to see if a summer mountain pasture could be opened there. The mountain vegetation was lush, the climate cool and pleasant, natural feed abundant, and there were clean water sources. It was a suitable summer resort for horses and other large livestock.

The most ready-made place was naturally Damei Village. This small village built on the ruins of Gou Family Village was firmly controlled by the Transmigration Regime. There were water sources near the village, and nearly a thousand *mu* of valley and sloping land that could be used for grazing and planting feed.

But this matter required the nod from Wu De, who controlled all civil affairs.

"I have no objection to establishing a pasture in Damei Village," Wu De said. "It's just that the road to Damei Village passes through the county town. Does that affect you?"

"Look at you," Yang Baogui disagreed. "If you put it that way, Bairen City is only a few kilometers from the county town. Besides, isn't the area around the county town under our surveillance now?"

"True enough," Wu De nodded. "However, after establishing a pasture there, you will lack strong protection. Damei is over ten kilometers from here, and the road isn't hardened, just a simple highway. If something happens, reinforcements will take at least half an hour to arrive. You must rely on the Damei Village militia unit to protect the pasture."

"Wasn't the regime construction and militia training in Damei Village handled by Xi Yazhou personally? It shouldn't be too bad."

"No matter how good, they are just armed with big swords and spears. Besides, there are only twelve strictly trained backbone militiamen." Wu De drank a glass of wine. "Damei Village has a total of fifty households, two hundred and sixty-one people including men, women, old, and young. There are sixty-four males aged sixteen to fifty." His memory was very good, reciting the numbers accurately. "You must know one thing: Lingao is a place with serious banditry. If dozens of horses are raised in Damei, sixty-four able-bodied men might not be able to stop a large group of bandits—wealth moves people's hearts."

"Exaggerated, right? Just twenty or thirty horses—"

"Not exaggerated." Wu De said. "Do you know how much a horse sells for in this timeline?"

"One hundred taels?"
