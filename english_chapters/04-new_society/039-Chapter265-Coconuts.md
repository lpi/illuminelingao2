# Chapter 265 Coconuts

"Actually, there's no need to station so many transmigrators at the strongholds. One leader is enough. Maybe even zero is fine." Jiang Qiuyan was full of enthusiasm now that he had started talking. "We can adopt the method of immigrating and settling the borders. Move ten or twenty households of natives directly here, distribute land and houses to them, organize them into a collective farm or a military-agricultural colony. Establish a strict paramilitary organization, appoint a chief and deputy chief among them, issue weapons, conduct regular training. Wouldn't that solve both defense and development problems?"

"This sounds like the 'Strategic Hamlet Program' applied by the US military in Vietnam!"

"Whatever village it is, as long as it solves the problem, it's a good village."

"Moreover, moving whole families here is also good for the mental health of the stationed personnel. The emotional stability of a person guarding an empty fort alone and a person surrounded by dozens of households of subordinates living and working in peace is completely different. It also creates a sense of belonging and responsibility among the immigrants," Jiang Qiuyan said.

"This is a good idea!" Chen Haiyang slapped his thigh. "Not only here, but the Changhua base can also handle it this way. That way we don't need to leave too many troops."

Wang Luobin said, "The problem is, who do we migrate? We originally lack population in Lingao."

"There are plenty of people here!" Jiang Qiuyan pointed towards the stockade of Anyoule Market not far away. "Aren't there one or two hundred households living there? They are all fishermen or boat people. Aren't fishermen the best candidates for developing coastline bases? As long as we give them enough benefits—land, houses, and stability—are we afraid they won't switch sides to us?"

"Good, good, I think it's feasible!" Wang Luobin walked back and forth excitedly. "And this can also serve as a pilot for our future local administration—using immigrants to control immigrants!"

Chen Haiyang said, "Let's first establish the base, and then lure... no, recruit refugees. With our material conditions, attracting a dozen or twenty households to rely on us shouldn't be difficult. However, the first batch of stationed personnel still has to be our own people. Once everything is on the right track, we can switch to the local settlement mode."

The work of building the stronghold was handed over comprehensively to Zhang Xingpei. Yu Eshui, serving as "Chief Supervisor," squatted on the construction site every day in high spirits. Wang Luobin concentrated on surveying nearby resources, while Chen Haiyang took people to do an important task: picking coconuts.

There were large coconut groves on the seaside of Yulin Harbor. The greyish-white trunks were slanted, and the huge, drooping pinnate leaves swayed in the wind, making a rustling sound. Under the leaves hung bunches of coconuts. The sea breeze blew gently, carrying the unique refreshing scent of the seaside.

"This is truly a standard tropical landscape!" Chen Haiyang sighed with emotion.

"It will be ours from now on!" Liu Zheng felt refreshed. "I'll contract 500 *mu* of land here in the future to open a high-end resort."

"Stop dreaming. Be careful the Executive Committee assigns you here to guard the coconuts."

Coconuts were good things. The copious coconut water was germ-free raw water, which could be drunk directly or used as glucose injection in emergencies. The coconut meat was rich in fat and protein. Dried copra had an oil content of 60-65% and was an excellent oil crop. The remaining residue after oil extraction could be used as high-quality feed or fertilizer. The hard coconut shell could be made into activated carbon, which was the raw material for gas masks—indispensable for the chemical and military industries. The fibrous coconut coir outside the coconut shell was elastic, rot-resistant, and durable, a superior material for making cables, brushes, woven fabrics, and filling materials.

The entire coconut was a treasure. The Executive Committee had long coveted this resource. Coconuts grew everywhere in Hainan, but large-scale exploitable coconut groves were mainly in the Wenchang and Sanya areas. Although there were also some in Lingao, the quantity was small and scattered.

The coconuts here were mostly wild, ownerless objects. Whoever picked them owned them. Chen Haiyang commanded the sailors to come ashore, preparing to sweep all the coconuts on the nearby coastline back to the ship.

But picking coconuts was not an easy task. The coconut trees here were all very tall, generally over ten meters, and straight without branches. Unlike other fruit trees suitable for climbing, sailors who were usually nimble at climbing masts were dumbfounded by these coconut trees.

Several people tried to climb up, but without tools, they slid down after climbing two or three meters. One person finally managed to climb to the top, but he hugged the tree trunk and didn't know how to act—he had to hold the tree with one hand and pick with the other, but coconuts didn't grow singly; they grew in bunches. The thick stems were very tough. He pulled and tugged for a long time but couldn't pull one down. Instead, he exhausted himself and slid down dejectedly.

"Use a saw! Bring a saw up!"

Another sailor brought a hand saw and climbed up. He started sawing at the stem of a coconut bunch. Unexpectedly, the coconuts were heavy. Once the stem was sawed halfway, it couldn't support the weight and broke directly. A large bunch of coconuts, weighing twenty or thirty catties, smashed straight down at the head of the person below.

"Ouch!" A scream.

Fortunately, the person below dodged fast. The coconuts brushed past his scalp and hit his shoulder, immediately swelling it up high. If it had hit the head, he would have likely suffered a concussion.

"Damn it, can't we even deal with a few coconuts?" Chen Haiyang was furious. "Use guns! Shoot them down!"

"That's a waste of bullets."

"We can reimburse it! Shoot!"

Gunshots rang out, "Bang! Bang!" The Type 1644 rifles fired continuously. Coconuts fell one by one from the tree mixed with branches and leaves. Everyone disregarded the danger and rushed up to grab them.

"Ha, not small!" Chen Haiyang picked one up and shook it, feeling the heavy sloshing inside. "Smash it open and try!"

After smashing two, everyone drank the coconut water to their heart's content. The refreshing sweetness chilled their hearts.

"Good stuff! Definitely good stuff!" Everyone praised in unison.

"But shooting with rifles isn't a long-term solution. Bullets also cost money," Liu Zheng said as he gnawed on the coconut meat. "It's too uneconomical. And shooting one by one is too slow."

"I have a way!" A sailor beside them wiped his mouth after drinking enough. "When we were in our hometown, we used 'climbing hooks' to climb utility poles. That thing is much easier to use than climbing with bare hands."

"Right! Why didn't I think of that!"

The ship's carpenter immediately set to work, using steel bars to bend into hooks and fastening them to leather boots to make simple "climbing spikes." With this tool, plus a safety rope around the waist, climbing trees became easy and safe. One person climbed up with a machete, and with a few chops, a whole bunch of coconuts fell down. The people below only had to be careful to dodge.

In one afternoon, they harvested thousands of coconuts. They were piled up like a small mountain on the deck.

That night, the *Hangzhou* was brightly lit. Because the generator was running, the lights on the ship were exceptionally bright. Li Huamei, dressed in black night clothes, quietly touched the stern of the *Hangzhou* from the darkness.

She wasn't here to assassinate anyone, nor to damage the ship. She was just too curious about these "Australians." Especially about their ships that could sail without wind. This question scratched at her heart like a kitten's paw for days.

Ever since she boarded the *Hangzhou*, she had been observing secretly, trying to find the propulsion device of this ship. But apart from the two "propellers" underwater at the stern that she couldn't figure out, she didn't find any oars or sculls. And those two iron leaf things stopped moving once the ship anchored. What exactly made the ship move?

Today, taking advantage of the chaotic night with most people busy building the stronghold ashore and the crew on the ship exhausted and sleeping soundly, she decided to infiltrate the cabin to verify her conjecture.

She deftly climbed up the stern along the anchor chain. The deck was silent except for the rhythmic "chug-chug" sound coming from the middle of the cabin. She knew that was the "machine" working.

She touched the door of the engine room. The door was unlocked. A wave of heat mixed with the smell of oil rushed to her face. She slipped in.

The engine room was brightly lit. A huge iron lump was roaring in the middle. The huge flywheel was spinning rapidly, making people dizzy.

"So this is the 'machine'?" Li Huamei looked at this steel monster in shock. She couldn't understand how this thing, without eating grass or meat, could contain such terrifying power.

She carefully approached. The machine was exuding amazing heat. Next to the machine, there was an iron barrel connected to the machine with a copper pipe. She touched the copper pipe; it was slightly vibrating, and seemed to have liquid flowing inside.

"Could it be drinking water?" She was curious. She followed the copper pipe to the iron barrel, unscrewed the lid, and dipped her finger in to taste it.

"Pah! Pah!" It tasted pungent and bitter, definitely not water. It looked like some kind of oil, but had a very strange smell, completely different from the vegetable oil and tung oil she usually saw.

"So this monster drinks oil?" She was secretly amazed. Oil was expensive stuff. This monster was so big; how much oil did it have to drink in a day! No wonder these Australians were so rich; just raising this iron beast was not something ordinary people could afford.

Just as she was entranced by her inspection, footsteps suddenly came from the stairs above. Someone was coming down!

Li Huamei was startled and hurriedly looked around for a place to hide. But the engine room was empty at a glance, with nowhere to hide.

"Little Zhao, go check the oil pressure. I think the sound is a bit wrong."

"Okay, Squad Leader."

Two people wearing blue work clothes walked down. Li Huamei had no choice; she gritted her teeth, rolled swiftly on the spot, and got under the base of the diesel engine.

The space below was narrow and covered in oil sludge. She lay flat on the ground, not daring to breathe loudly. The huge roar of the diesel engine covered the sound of her heartbeat.

The two maintenance workers walked to the side of the machine, checked the instruments, and touched various parts.

"Everything looks normal."

"Maybe I heard it wrong. This Changchai engine is old after all; it's inevitable for it to be a bit loose."

"Squad Leader, how much longer do we have to stay here? I'm almost suffocating from the heat."

"Bear with it. Once the fort ashore is built, we can go down to rest."

The two chatted for a few more words before turning to leave. Li Huamei waited until their footsteps disappeared before crawling out from under the machine. Her black night-travel suit was now covered in black oil stains, looking extremely wretched.

"Phew, that was close!" She wiped the cold sweat (and oil dirt) from her forehead. Although she didn't fully understand the principle of this "Changchai," she at least confirmed one thing: this "iron beast" indeed relied on "drinking oil" to exert force. As for how it turned oil into power, that was beyond her understanding.

"Australians are truly unfathomable." She sighed lightly, carefully retreated out of the engine room, and disappeared into the night.
