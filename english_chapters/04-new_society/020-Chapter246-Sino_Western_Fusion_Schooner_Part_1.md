# Chapter 246: The Hybrid Schooner (Part 1)

The assessment results were in. Fifteen or sixteen men with shipbuilding skills, including the clan head, were retained at Bopu as shipyard staff, to live with their families in the newly constructed Baitu Village. However, Wu De rejected their request to live together as a clan. Instead, he enforced strict regulations: all adult married men must establish separate households and register their residency individually.

Wu De refined the regulations further: within each household, a maximum of three generations were permitted. The first two generations were restricted to one couple each. When the third generation married, they must establish a separate household. Married brothers were strictly prohibited from remaining in the same household.

The separated households were then distributed into standard residential buildings, with a maximum of two families from the same clan permitted per building.

Remaining Lin clan members were relocated to the Bairen Commune residential area, scattered similarly, and assigned as general laborers. Thus the Lin family—once one of Baitu Village's two ruling clans—was effectively dismantled. Clan Head Lin Xianming lost his former prestige and could only work as a regular shipyard employee. Every household now owed the Transmigration Group sixty taels for housing—a sum many Lin members could actually afford, though none dared reveal their wealth for fear the "Short-haired thieves" would confiscate it.

While older Lin clan members, having witnessed official brutality, were submissive to Lingao's power, the younger generation harbored considerable resentment—particularly those from core branches who had enjoyed high status since childhood. They held deep grudges over their lost prestige. Most galling was that side-branch members who had held low status previously became salaried shipyard staff simply because they worked harder and possessed better skills.

Lin Gonglao naturally missed the staff ranks. Since unmarried, he remained under his father's household, but his status was reduced to "commune member," forcing him to do odd jobs for work points.

Staff members received monthly salaries and high income; commune members worked as coolies doing hard labor. He couldn't bear the disparity.

A cousin spoke up. "Big Brother, say something—what is Uncle thinking? Is our Lin family just going to scatter like this?"

"What else can we do?" A young man squatting with drooping head muttered. "They're capable—"

Lin Gonglao's brother, Lin Gongxun, kicked him fiercely. "You scum! Coward! How can you say such things?"

"But—" The beaten man seemed accustomed to being a punching bag. "Isn't it true we can't beat them?"

"Bullshit! They just have better weapons—some bird guns. In hand-to-hand combat, I can beat seven or eight of these softies alone!" Lin Gongxun said aggressively, stealing glances at a nearby sentry. The crowd seemed unsatisfied; seeing surrounding sentries and "cadres" not interfering, they cursed more vigorously.

"Exactly, Big Brother and Second Brother's kung fu isn't for show."

"Winning with firearms doesn't count as heroism!"

"One-on-one, we'd beat them until they look for their teeth on the ground!"

The defeatist scrambled away under punches and kicks.

Lin Guangding squeezed over and whispered, "Uncle Gonglao, tell everyone to stop cursing. Walls have ears."

But Lin Gonglao scolded him too. "You're also a wretch! A gutless coward. The Aussies are overseas barbarians—I'll curse them to their faces; they don't understand." He shouted obscenities in Minnan dialect at a "True Kun" in the distance. Sure enough, the other party showed no reaction, and the surrounding Lins cheered.

"Brother Gonglao is formidable!"

"The Aussies are wretches! Dare not even fart."

"The Aussies dare not offend our Lin family—shipbuilding depends on Great Uncle!"

Lin Guangding tried again. "Among the long-term workers are people from our place—"

"What's there to fear from traitors?" Lin Gonglao suddenly felt powerful. "I can crush them with one finger."

While he was bragging, Lin Xianming rushed over and hissed, "Are you seeking death! What nonsense are you spouting?" He looked around carefully. "Think our Lin family hasn't suffered enough?"

Lin Gonglao wanted to argue, but his father dragged him to a desolate spot.

"Speak less of such boundless talk in the future!" Lin Xianming instructed quietly. "This group of Short-haired thieves is formidable."

"Dad, sooner or later they'll be wiped out by the sea lords. Even if not, if we report to officials, the Imperial Court will suppress them—"

A heavy knuckle rap on his head. "Imperial Court? What does the Court have to do with us! Without it, we were living fine guarding our ancestral graves in Fujian!" Lin Xianming softened. "The Short-hairs are passable too. They provide houses, pay wages, don't make us work for free. We common folks—whoever becomes Emperor, we pay grain and taxes. Having food, clothes, and shelter is enough. Don't cause trouble!"

Seeing his son fall silent, Lin Xianming added, "When the time comes, I'll get you into the shipyard as staff. The Short-hairs still value your father."

Lin Gonglao muttered. His thoughts differed from his father's. Lin Xianming sought to lead the clan through troubled times peacefully. Lin Gonglao still possessed a young man's desire for power, constantly missing the days when the Lin family ruled Baitu and he could order people around.

The Lu family's backlash was much smaller. Their population was smaller, and Lu Youtian was a pragmatist with no doubts about transmigrator policies. He immediately had clansmen register separately; even his unmarried son registered a separate household. His only request was keeping his apprentice son by his side to continue training. He saw the Lin family's fate—unskilled descendants became basic laborers.

Since all Lu family males were blacksmiths, they were divided by skill level after assessment. Most were assigned to Bairen City's machinery factory; a few remained at Bopu as shipyard ironworkers. Those with insufficient skills entered apprentice teams at the shipyard and machinery factory.

Lu Youtian became master craftsman of the shipyard's ironwork workshop. Shipbuilding required numerous iron parts. Since Wen Desi couldn't master all European shipbuilding crafts, many Chinese techniques were continued.

Before the New Year, Wen Desi led mechanicalsspecialists to draw complete lines plans and structural drawings. Though rough, they provided construction basis.

Shortly after New Year's Day, the keel was laid under Wen Desi's guidance. The keel was placed on blocks in the dry dock; stem and stern posts were inlaid at both ends. This arduous task required the Construction Company's truck crane. Wen Desi then realized he hadn't installed hoisting equipment and rushed to build indigenous derricks.

Floor timbers were placed transversely on the keel, with the keelson atop them running longitudinally. All three were bolted together. The futtocks—curved ribs forming the ship's sides—were closely connected to floor timbers. Bending timber to design angles without structural damage cost Wu Kuangming considerable effort. Fortunately, the steam boiler made the process fast and effective.

All ribs were installed compactly, double-layered in the middle and near masts where stress was highest. Heavy planks (clamps) were arranged horizontally inside the ribs to support deck beam ends. Mast partners had reinforcement plates of sturdy ironwood inserted vertically between deck beams, while mast heels stood on the keelson.

During construction, scaffolding surrounded the hull. Outer planks were fixed to ribs with bolts. To prevent leakage, kapok served as caulking—this fiber was nearly water-impermeable with excellent buoyancy. All seams were sealed with traditional Chinese mixture of tung oil, hemp fibers, and oyster shell ash. Wood tar was applied to both hulls.

The internal structure followed Chinese principles with watertight bulkheads. Since this wasn't a dedicated warship requiring heavy broadside batteries, a full lower gun deck was unnecessary.
