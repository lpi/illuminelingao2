# Chapter 315: Acquiring Dachang

Immediately, Liao Daxing was summoned, and these matters were explained to him one by one. Liao Daxing said: "It is hard for the Masters to think so thoroughly! Shopkeeper Feng must be grateful knowing this in the netherworld. However, there is one point the Masters have overlooked—"

In any merchant family, financial affairs are managed by the head of the house. Once the head of the house dies, debts owed to others and debts owed by others must be cleared and settled immediately. This is a large sum. At such a time, collecting debts is very difficult, while creditors will come knocking immediately. Therefore, cash flow difficulties often occur, leading to the forced sale of family property.

Many businesses look prosperous while the head of the house is alive, but once he dies suddenly, it is equivalent to total bankruptcy of credit. After the funeral is done, the family also declines.

"Not to mention anything else, just take the warehouse receipt left by Shopkeeper Feng. The orphans and widow of the Feng family won't get the price of 3.8 taels per *shi*. Most likely, they will be forced to sell it cheaply to other sugar firms. If the other party has some conscience, they might offer 2.5 taels; if they are blinded by greed, selling for 1.7 or 1.8 taels would be considered good!"

"That dark?!" Everyone was surprised. Was there no professional loyalty left?

"It's not dark; it has always been this way."

"In that case, send his family three hundred taels of silver as a condolence payment. And—" Chang Shide thought for a moment, "The matter of settling accounts will be handled by someone sent by the Guild to avoid anyone having improper thoughts. If silver offers are needed for settlement, South China Sugar will advance it."

Liao Daxing nodded: "The Master thinks thoroughly! The lowly one will arrange this immediately. Only, the person representing the Guild—"

"Let your brother go." Chang Shide thought of Liao Diahua. Liao Diahua was also from a merchant background and was no stranger to auditing accounts. "He is the branch manager of Qiwei Escort Bureau; I'll give him a title of Guild Executive as well—having no conflict of interest while being able to intervene legitimately."

So the matter was settled. Sure enough, under South China Sugar's forceful intervention, all sugar firms harboring designs on Richangji withdrew their hands.

The first operation of the Leizhou Sugar Industry Guild showed its uniqueness. Behind this incident, many people saw that the new guild truly protected everyone's interests—helping orphans and widows hardly yields substantial returns.

Using this as an opportunity, Chang Shide carried out drastic reforms on the original trade guild.

All sugar firms participating in the Sugar Industry Guild held a director position and participated in deliberations. Daily affairs were run by the newly established "Standing Committee."

This committee consisted of five Standing Executives. Each executive was responsible for a specific matter, led by the "Secretary-General"—a role naturally assumed by Chang Shide.

The operating expenses were covered by guild dues. Each sugar firm shared the dues proportionally according to their capital. The total amount of dues was ten thousand taels per year.

The most obvious change under this system was the introduction of a completely modern financial system, ensuring the destination of every sum of money was clear. The transparency of this financial system caused quite a stir among the guild directors.

For Chang Shide and the others, this system was preparation for a future joint-stock company. Once locals gradually got used to the transmigrators' business model and concepts, forming the Leizhou Sugar Industry Joint-Stock Company would happen naturally. Then they would no longer need financial transfusions from Guangzhou and could openly leverage the capital of these sugar merchants for operations.

To speed up the acquisition speed, Wen Tong seconded a large number of skilled clerks from various sugar firms through the Sugar Industry Guild to help at South China Sugar; their wages and food during this period were all paid by South China Sugar.

"Although there are a thousand things to do right now, the shipment of sugar cannot stop for a day." Wen Tong said, "Don't forget the Guangzhou Station borrowed usury for us. The longer it drags on, the more disadvantageous it is."

"Mm, but we promised these sugar merchants 3.8 taels. What if Guangzhou can't sell at this price? Although we monopolize Leizhou sugar sales, if the demand is small, we are helpless."

"In Guangzhou, last week's market price was already 3.95 taels. The British are willing to pay four taels per *shi*; the price won't come down in the short term."

"There is also selling to Vietnam." Chang Shide was very confident. "Wu Yujia doesn't have silver there, but he has plenty of rice. We'll exchange it all for rice, then talk business with Boss Zhu of Dachang."

Bringing in Dachang Grain Firm as a partner was Chang Shide's idea. In his official document to Lingao, he argued: Although South China Sugar opening a wholly-owned rice firm would yield much higher profits, they lacked experienced and reliable managers to run it—that was one; secondly, South China Sugar was already "thunderous" in Leizhou. If they blatantly intervened in the rice business after securing the sugar industry, it would inevitably cause fear in the local business community, leading to boycotts—money can't all be earned; winning hearts is more important.

Dachang Grain Firm was the local merchant most friendly to South China Sugar from the beginning. Not that Boss Zhu Fusheng of Dachang had any foresight, but his sense of smell was sharper than other rice firms, and his capital was the largest. When the immigrants organized by South China Sugar first arrived, he scented the opportunity and came to sell grain, offering very good trading terms: South China Sugar could take grain at any time, settle accounts on the three festivals, and enjoy promotions like getting one *shi* free for every twenty bought. This solved the headache of organizing large-scale grain supplies for Wen Tong and the others.

To keep this big client, Zhu Fusheng did his utmost to satisfy every request from South China Sugar and contributed significantly during South China Sugar's confrontation with the Haiyi Guild—of course, he had selfish motives too, as South China Sugar still owed him several thousand taels in accounts payable.

With such a foundation of trust, cooperation would be relatively easy. Moreover, Liao Daxing himself had started as a clerk at Dachang, making it even more convenient to discuss cooperation.

However, Liao Daxing's first visit returned in failure.

Chang Shide felt strange and asked: "Why didn't it work?"

"Boss Zhu's family is having domestic trouble," Liao Daxing said. "It just seemed his mood wasn't good. He only said he was interested, but afraid he couldn't make the decision yet. Said to wait and see." Since there was domestic trouble, he naturally wouldn't be interested in cooperating with South China Sugar; whether to talk or not was irrelevant.

"First wife beating the mistress?" Wen Tong was curious.

Liao Daxing didn't know what a "mistress" (*Er Nai*) was, but understood the meaning. He shook his head: "No, Boss Zhu only has one wife. The lowly one probed a few times; it sounds like a matter between relatives involving the rice firm."

"I'll send someone to inquire immediately," Chen Tianxiong said.

The next day, he reported as follows: First, Dachang Grain Firm was a traditional Chinese joint-stock enterprise. The shares were divided into twenty-one and a half shares, originally one thousand taels per share; second, Dachang's shareholders were basically Zhu family clansmen or relatives—aunts, uncles, and the like; third, the recent domestic trouble was that the clansmen felt dividends were too low; fourth, Dachang's operating condition was quite good.

"Zhu Fusheng has a headache exactly because of this," Chen Tianxiong explained. "His clansmen aren't very progressive; they all rely on this rice firm. They cause trouble with him every few days." Their demands: either increase the bonus dividends or stuff their own kids in to draw a salary for doing nothing.

"Actually, the returns for Dachang shareholders over these years have been very good. The annual bonus is five or six thousand taels. One share can get two hundred taels—"

"Wait, it should be two hundred thirty taels per share," Chang Shide said.

"Dividends are distributed based on twenty-three shares; one and a half shares are labor shares for the shopkeeper and all the clerks."

"This return is considered very good, right?" Wen Tong remembered Yu Eshu saying that a middle-income family of four or five could live well on fifty taels of silver a year.

Chen Tianxiong nodded: "Yes, but human hearts are insatiable." He turned a page in his notebook. "I investigated the shareholder situation. Among all shareholders, Boss Zhu himself owns eleven shares. The remaining ten and a half shares belong to over ten large and small shareholders; the smallest share is only half a share."

It can be imagined that even if Boss Zhu welcomes South China Sugar's investment, the small shareholders won't want to give up their shares—Dachang Grain Firm's returns are so high, they want to share more money; how would they be willing to sell?

"This is a bit thorny." Wen Tong scratched his head.

Chang Shide was full of confidence: "It might have been difficult in the past, but ever since Zhu An was finished, we won't face any obstacles in whatever we do now. I'd like to see whose gall is so big."

"Although doing that is easy, it is harmful to our reputation after all. I have an idea, but we need to tip off Old Zhu beforehand. Like this—"

Before long, a terrible piece of news spread through the streets and alleys of Xuwen County: South China Sugar is to open a rice firm immediately! This news terrified grain merchants across Xuwen and even Leizhou. The Rice Industry Guild was in chaos; the executive on duty and major rice firm bosses all came to visit, trying to glean some news from Wen Tong.

Wen Tong's answer was decisive: No, South China Sugar does not plan to open a rice firm itself; there is no such thing.

But the street gossip discussed this topic with increasing enthusiasm—these rumors were all spread by Xiao Zhanfeng. What South China Sugar's next target was became a hot topic for the common people of Xuwen.

Terror signals appeared repeatedly: strange flat-bottomed ships brought three thousand *shi* of rice at once, unloading at Hai'an Street; Manager Wen was surveying wasteland everywhere, asking about land prices; Liao Daxing was inquiring in teahouses where rice industry clerks gathered if there were any unemployed rice firm clerks...

All this indicated that South China Sugar opening a rice firm was already a certainty. The grain industry in Xuwen was instantly plunged into gloom: they have money and power, and aren't afraid of you causing trouble. If they really open up, will there be any way for us to live?

In this tense and hesitant atmosphere, agents directed by Chang Shide easily bought ten and a half shares from Dachang's small shareholders at a price of one thousand eight hundred taels per share, instantly becoming Dachang's second-largest shareholder.

With shares in hand, the matter of opening a rice firm naturally evaporated. Wen Tong personally went to the Rice Industry Guild to clarify rumors and solemnly announced: South China Sugar will not open a rice firm.

Once this news came out, the rice bosses and clerks naturally breathed a sigh of relief. The people who sold their shares certainly beat their chests and stamped their feet, but the shares could not be bought back.

The silver for this acquisition was provided by Boss Zhu, and South China Sugar would provide twenty thousand *shi* of brown rice to Dachang Grain Firm at a discounted CIF price of one tael per *shi* as compensation.

Dachang Grain Firm was still managed by Boss Zhu. Boss Zhu was very happy—he had forever rid himself of his insatiably greedy relatives and clansmen, and obtained a cheap source of goods: as soon as the share transfer contract was signed, South China Sugar became his main supplier. Currently supplying at a CIF price of 1.2 taels per *shi*, this price was about the same as his own acquisition cost, but saved transportation costs and risks en route. Extremely profitable.

"It doesn't matter if we let Boss Zhu of Dachang earn some money. Let him be happy counting money first. We can just collect more personal income tax from him later."

"And consumption tax, mistress tax, servant tax..." Chang Shide laughed, "Finally, slap on a property tax. Long live the Transmigration State's taxes!"

"Old Zhu is very active. He says with such a stable and cheap source of goods, he can really spread his wings. He's preparing to expand branch offices." Wen Tong said with a smile, "We have to support him too. Cash crop planting in Guangdong takes up a lot of land and has already affected grain production; grain trade has great potential."

Chang Shide said: "Although Leizhou has sugar, it also suffers from sugar. Prices of everything are soaring. We not only need to obtain the financial source of sugar but also withdraw part of the silver by importing more livelihood goods to curb inflation." He thought for a moment, "I wonder if Indian cotton cloth can sell well here."

"Sources of goods can be organized. We just need to report the demand." Wen Tong said, "I want to buy up all the land near the South Gate Sugar Refinery to build shops for rent. The market here will get better and better."

The group discussed for a while longer before dispersing. Wen Tong returned to the courtyard and called Ah Zhu.

"Go take a shower!" This was the code for Wen Tong to sleep with her. Ah Zhu, who hadn't been visited by the master for many days, was originally somewhat fearful. Hearing the master's order, her heart rejoiced, and she hurriedly went to bathe.

That night, Wen Tong, who hadn't been intimate for many days due to being tied up with affairs, was both mighty and fierce. When he charged violently, he would always recall his image in the Haiyi Guild hall—calm and composed, commanding, unflappable... a series of idioms constantly surfaced in his mind. He felt full of vigor.

When the clouds scattered and rain ceased, and Wen Tong went limp all over about to rest, Ah Zhu cuddled up:

"Master, Ah Zhu begs you for a favor."

"What is it?" Wen Tong didn't mind.

"Ah Zhu has a sister, who was also from a fishing family in the past—"

"Did she become a pirate later?" Wen Tong thought of her background and teased. He didn't notice Ah Zhu's face had changed. She forced a smile:

"Master is joking. Her family was poor, so she was sold to a wealthy family as a maid since childhood. Recently she has nowhere to go and wants to find a place to serve a new master. She has good looks, a good temper, and is good at needlework..."
