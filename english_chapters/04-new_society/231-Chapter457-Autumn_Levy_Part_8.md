# Chapter 457 - Autumn Levy (Part 8)

By his calculations, the three hundred *mu* of paddy that the Tiandihui had helped cultivate would yield about fifty percent more per *mu* than in previous years. This achievement was enough to make anyone's jaw drop—no wonder everyone said the Australians possessed secret farming techniques.

"If not for this land survey business, this year's harvest would have been even more profitable," Liu Guangbiao said regretfully. "Third Uncle! Come spring, we should have the Tiandihui manage all our land..." He suddenly stopped, apparently realizing this was improper.

Liu Youren said nothing. Having the Tiandihui manage all their land meant the Australians would know exactly how much land the family truly held. He sighed—this really was a dilemma.

"Guangbiao, I actually think that if the land survey were conducted by the Australians themselves, it might be better."

"Third Uncle?" Liu Guangbiao didn't understand. Given the Australians' exacting standards and their terrifyingly efficient methods, probably not even half could be hidden—even the land falsely registered under their family's name might not escape.

"The Australians are strict in their methods, but more lenient in governance than the official yamen," Liu Youren said quietly. "Strict where strictness is needed, lenient where leniency is appropriate—what they call 'balancing severity with mercy.' In comparison, the government is actually somewhat haphazard..."

"Third Uncle!" Liu Guangbiao was startled. These words bordered on sedition. Remote though Lingao might be, the government's authority still held some weight. "You mustn't speak so carelessly!"

"Hmph, naturally this is just between you and me." Liu Youren said. For now, they would handle things this way. Once Chief Xun arrived, they could hear what he had to say before deciding on the next steps.

For over half a month, such negotiations and haggling continued in every major household across the county. A pall of tension and anxiety hung over each family. Those with any connections to one another traveled about constantly, gathering information. Households with ties to the Tiandihui suddenly became the county's focal point; visitors practically wore down their doorsteps. Even the parvenu despised by the major households—Lin Quan'an of the "Quanfu Trading House," who had made his fortune procuring goods for the Australians—suddenly became a hot commodity, receiving guests every few days. Some left gifts and immediately departed; others sat down to ramble on about nothing at all. Lin Quan'an hardly knew what to say.

Besides Lin Quan'an, there was also the "Runshitang" pharmacy. This shop's business suddenly boomed as members of major households all seemed to have "fallen ill," specifically requesting that the proprietor Yang Shixiang examine them personally. Since physicians and pharmacists were one and the same, he did practice medicine on the side, but he hadn't expected such a sudden epidemic.

Of course, no concrete information could be extracted from any of these people. Never mind Lin Quan'an and Yang Shixiang, who had nothing to do with land matters. Even Zhang Youfu, who supposedly had the closest ties to the Australians and the best access to information, couldn't reveal anything.

In contrast, the small grain households without wealth or power suffered no such alarm this time. They had no extra land to report in the first place; some even shouldered tax burdens for land that wasn't even theirs. Further squeezing wouldn't yield much. Of course, this wasn't because Chen Minggang had suddenly developed a conscience and spared them—clerks were the type who ate people without spitting out the bones and would squeeze oil even from pebbles. Rather, Chen Minggang felt the Australians were primarily targeting the major households, and going to great lengths to squeeze the small households would be pointless and wouldn't produce results. It might even provoke backlash from the smallholders. Chen Minggang sensed that the Australians' attitude toward common folk was entirely different from the Ming government's. If trouble erupted, he would certainly get the worst of it.

The major households' frequent networking and communications gave the Political Security General Administration an excellent opportunity. The Action Division's surveillance unit used this intelligence to compile a "Relationship Map of the County's Major Households." When Chinese people encountered difficulties, their first recourse was naturally to their relatives and friends. This exercise gave them a rough understanding of the degrees of closeness among these families.

Liu Dalin's household also became a center of the whirlwind. When Huang Binkun first visited, Liu Dalin had been noncommittal about his questions. In his view, the matter of clearing land records was legitimate—regardless of the Australian question, schemes like hiding land and false registration damaged the court's revenues.

Of course, from a personal standpoint, immediate interests had to be looked after. When individual interests collided with the government's, most people still chose to protect their own. The Liu family had once been of middling means, but ever since his father's generation obtained a degree, the official tax exemption had been enough to cover the entire household's grain levies. But one always had relatives and friends to look after—they were all close family and dear friends—and he wasn't a saint, so he'd agreed. Over time, the amount of land registered under the Liu family name had somehow grown to a thousand *mu*.

Regarding this land survey affair, Liu Dalin himself hadn't been troubled—Chen Minggang knew the Australians regarded this *jinshi* with great respect and had plans to make use of him. So, as in previous years, he hadn't even sent a grain notice. Even the customary visits to pay respects and angle for tips during this season had been dispensed with.

However, Chen Minggang still intended to cut this previously untouchable *jinshi* Liu down to size. He didn't send Liu Dalin a grain notice, but the landowners who had falsely registered under Liu's name weren't so fortunate. Chen Minggang had detailed records showing exactly how much land each family had sheltered under Liu Dalin's name. He sent grain notices directly to these landowners, requiring them to report their land holdings by the deadline in preparation for assessment.

With this, Liu Dalin's relatives and friends of every degree were thrown into an uproar. Everyone knew Chen Minggang was ruthless and difficult to deal with. They hastened to the county seat to see Liu Dalin and ask him for a solution. The gate of the Liu residence inside the county's west gate was suddenly crowded with sedan chairs and attendants.

Like all scholars, Liu Dalin preferred quiet over commotion. Since his legs had become immobile, he rarely went out. Now, suddenly descended upon by this crowd of relatives and friends, each demanding to see him, to get his opinion, to find solutions, to conduct negotiations—he was utterly at a loss. He could only instruct his steward to receive them while he himself retreated to his study.

Listening to the hubbub of voices from the front, Liu Dalin felt helpless. He felt both apologetic toward his relatives and friends, and annoyed with them—as if his help was something they were entitled to.

His family had been scholars for generations. His grandfather had no official degree but considerable literary reputation. His father had served as a prefect. He himself was a *jinshi*. They could fairly be called the most prominent gentry family in the county. In the past, any matter could be resolved simply by sending his card to the county yamen. Now, no matter how many cards he sent to the yamen, it would probably be useless—he'd have to negotiate with the Australians.

But dealing with the Australians was the last thing he wanted to do.

---

Given the deference and respect the Australians showed him, if he were willing to intercede, they would surely give him some face. Things could be negotiated. But he truly didn't want to get involved.

Although the Australians hadn't done anything particularly bad, they were ultimately foreign barbarians who didn't submit to proper rule. In Lingao, they had brazenly built cities and established their own system—practically a separatist regime. He had tried to keep his distance; how could he now freely engage with them? If the Baldies intended to use him, and he went to them seeking favors, wouldn't he be handing them leverage? His lifetime of good reputation would be ruined.

Yet he couldn't fail to give his relatives and friends some answer, or he'd earn a reputation for being "heartless"—and that he couldn't bear either.

Just as he was fretting, a maidservant who attended his wife arrived. Seeing his clouded expression, she didn't dare speak and just stood at the door, peeking in.

"What is it?" Liu Dalin finally noticed her. "If you have something to say, come in and speak."

"Yes, Master!" The maidservant hurried in. "Several uncles and aunts from Madam's side have come to see her. They're talking in the rear hall now. They all want to come see you, but Madam was afraid you might not be feeling well, so she's holding them back for now..."

"I understand." Liu Dalin waved his hand. "You may go."

The maidservant hesitated, then added, "Madam asks if you could perhaps look after her family's close relatives..."

"Go back and attend to Madam. I have my own plans for this matter."

The maidservant withdrew. "My own plans"—but in truth, he had no idea where those plans might come from. Liu Dalin suddenly realized he had no one around him to consult.

Friends—he certainly had them—but these friends were the type who could discuss principles of philosophy and moral cultivation, or compose poetry and essays, appreciate music and chess and painting. They were brilliant at such things, but when actual practical matters arose, they couldn't offer a single useful suggestion. Everyone flattered him as a man of "lofty virtue and pure conduct, luminous in purpose"—and indeed, he deserved such praise. But the current problem was not something that "lofty virtue and pure conduct, luminous in purpose" could address.

After much thought, the only possibility was the second young master of the Huang Family Village, Huang Binkun—the son of the old Master Huang. He had visited several days ago to ask how Liu Dalin intended to respond to this land survey business. Because the Liu family, since his father's time as an official, had enjoyed tax exemptions for two generations, apart from perfunctory dealings with clerks seeking tips during festivals, they had long been uninvolved in grain levy matters. He hadn't been able to give any coherent answer at the time.

Now, in retrospect, father and son Huang were people worth consulting. Though the Huangs were rural strongmen, they had exerted themselves strenuously over the years to defend their homeland. Liu Dalin had always taken an interest in county affairs and thus greatly respected the Huang father and son, exchanging visits on festive and solemn occasions. When Huang Binkun passed the county-level examination, Liu Dalin had personally called to offer congratulations, giving the Huang family tremendous face.

Thinking of this, he felt a glimmer of hope. He quickly wheeled his chair to the doorway and called for a servant.

"Go and tell all the gentlemen that I am aware of their concerns. Please ask them to return home for now; they will receive a reply in due course."

"Yes!" The servant was about to leave.

"Wait!" Liu Dalin knew this crowd had probably all brought gifts. "All gifts received are to be returned."

"Yes—"

"The guests from Madam's side as well—don't accept their gifts either. Give them the same message!"

Having issued these instructions, he called over a personal page and ordered:

"Go to the county school and invite Young Master Huang of the Huang family to come for a conversation."
