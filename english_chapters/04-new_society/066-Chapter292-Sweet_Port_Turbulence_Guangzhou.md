# Chapter 292: Sweet Port Turbulence – Guangzhou

Ma Qianzhu raised a concern. "Aren't there too many branches? How much manpower will that require?"

"Not much," Yan Ming answered. "Our plan is to rely on local natives as much as possible, dispatching only one or two operatives to manage each location. They'll simply appear as merchants."

Of course, penetrating deep into the Great Ming's heartland to establish branches demanded substantial capital. The transmigrators lacked that capacity for now. The current plan focused on opening a bank in Guangzhou.

"People generally resist new things," Yan Ming elaborated on the strategy. "At the outset, we can position it directly under the Guangzhou Station system. First, we absorb deposits through Purple Treasure Pavilion—it already possesses considerable credit, making deposit collection easier. Before long, Violet Sincerity Trading should be able to do the same. Deposits absorbed by these two entities will be allocated and deployed by the Guangzhou Bank. Going forward, financial dealings and capital flows of all merchants under the Guangzhou Station will be unified and processed through the bank. Credit accumulates gradually."

This arrangement effectively centralized the financial authority of the Guangzhou Station. The Executive Committee readily grasped the benefits. Zi Corporation's Guangzhou operations were thriving, the scope expanding daily, and dealings with local merchants multiplying. Financial problems had grown acute. Currently, the Guangzhou Station simply filled out requisition forms, registered expenditure purposes, and drew directly from accounts; cash collection and disbursement remained entirely self-managed; and supervision was lacking. Though quarterly financial audits existed, they merely reconciled inflows and outflows. Various discretionary expenses defied verification entirely.

"Unchecked power inevitably breeds corruption." To the Executive Committee, the Guangzhou Station now resembled a large state-owned enterprise operating without oversight. When operations had been modest, minor discrepancies mattered little. But as the enterprise grew, such matters demanded attention. If the four principals at the Guangzhou Station colluded to manipulate the books, the Finance Committee in Lingao would struggle to detect it.

Contemplating a future with multiplying overseas agencies made it worse—Guangzhou was merely the first. As locations proliferated, the tangle of threads would only grow. Moreover, once interest chains formed around embezzled funds, dismantling them proved enormously complicated. The prospect of lobbying campaigns targeting the Executive Committee, or bribery schemes to purchase votes among the masses... the mere thought kept the gentlemen of the Executive Committee awake at night.

With a bank established, all subordinate enterprises and partner businesses would be required to open corporate accounts. Various special funds could maintain separate ledgers. Every capital movement would be recorded, eliminating the chaos of everything mixed in a single undifferentiated pot.

Considered this way, operating a bank offered numerous advantages. Quite apart from remittance business, internal controls alone would vastly improve.

"Won't this excessively constrain enterprises? Those in charge might become overly cautious."

"Not at all," Cheng Dong explained. "Establishing a bank and requiring transaction records is simply part of a sound financial system. It has no bearing on who uses money or in what amounts, much less on interfering with specific operations."

"Enterprise financial autonomy remains intact. That won't change," Cheng Dong emphasized.

"In that case, Lingao should probably open a branch as well."

"Lingao currently has Delong Grain Trading House handling such matters. We simply carve out a section for concurrent operation. For all the enterprises and institutions we've established, we must gradually build financial systems, open corporate accounts, and strive to complete comprehensive bill-based and institutionalized financial operations within the year."

Thus the proposal to open a bank was approved. To avoid brand proliferation complicating management, the Guangzhou establishment would be called "Delong Bank." Administratively, it would report directly to the Finance Committee.

"Is there a suitable person to dispatch?"

"Yes—Meng Xian will do."

Everyone knew Meng Xian, though not for his financial expertise. They remembered him from his time as a shooting instructor during New Army training—his marksmanship was extraordinarily precise, befitting his sports school shooting background.

"He studied finance and accounting in America. It's his profession."

Wen Desi considered for a moment. "His appearance presents certain challenges."

The man stood 180 centimeters tall, weighed ninety kilograms, sported a full beard and curly hair, had small eyes, and possessed well-developed musculature. Standing on a Lingao street, he already looked conspicuously out of place. Sending him to Guangzhou would only amplify the effect.

"It hardly matters. I think his looks carry a distinctly exotic flavor. In a place like Guangzhou, where people from all directions intermingle, it actually serves as excellent cover." Cheng Dong advocated strongly. "Besides, he's trained as half an agent—extensive firearms experience."

Such a conspicuous figure, regardless of his marksmanship, could at most serve as an action operative. Intelligence gathering was clearly unsuitable. But since Cheng Dong pressed his recommendation, no one raised further objections.

"Very well—consider the matter settled."

As for the suggestion to borrow funds at high interest in Guangzhou for deployment in the Leizhou sugar market, the Executive Committee approved that as well—though risk was substantial, profits were essentially guaranteed. A telegram went immediately to Guangzhou: borrowing authorized.

Upon receiving the message, the Guangzhou team sprang into action. Everyone divided responsibilities. Shen Fan was instructed to accelerate deposit absorption, taking in whatever he could secure. Guo Yi and the others focused on borrowing. Guo Yi had already discussed the matter with Zhang Xin and Yan Maoda; though no definitive word had come from Lingao, the urgency demanded provisional action. They had already made contacts with families potentially willing to lend. The moment the authorization telegram arrived, execution began.

But matters proved less smooth than anticipated. The reason was simple: monsoon season approached, foreign ships would soon sail, and bulk export goods required substantial silver. Cash was tight throughout the city. Even a major merchant like Gao Ju found his liquidity constrained. After negotiation, Gao Ju promised only thirty thousand taels available for immediate transfer—and that only after having subordinates check accounts repeatedly and delay several payments to scrape together the sum. Guo Yi knew the Leizhou operation required at least another hundred fifty thousand taels beyond the fifty thousand already transported to guarantee victory.

Under normal circumstances, a hundred fifty thousand taels presented no great difficulty in Guangzhou city, but presently even heroes found themselves thwarted by a single copper coin. Though Shen Fan had proposed deposit absorption as a solution, distant water couldn't quench an immediate thirst. Moreover, Violet Sincerity Trading had cultivated an image of formidable resources. Appearing overly eager in borrowing would inevitably damage that reputation. Several months immersed in the commercial world had taught the Guangzhou team the traditional business mentality—regardless of actual circumstances, necessary appearances must be maintained, even if borrowed money funded the facade. The moment one displayed weakness, everything became difficult.

However, if today's meeting succeeded, circumstances might turn decisively.

The sedan chair had been specially ordered by Shen Fan for Guo Yi's recent use in visiting guests. Strictly speaking, commoners like him shouldn't ride four-bearer sedan chairs, but Guangzhou's long history as an open port had normalized such status violations. Four-bearer sedans were ubiquitous on the streets—hardly noteworthy anymore. The only remaining restraint was avoiding green woolen cloth. The chair itself was exquisitely crafted, with glass windows from Lingao inlaid on three sides—transparent flat glass was quietly entering the lives of wealthy merchants and gentry throughout Guangzhou. Colorful silk curtains hung inside; the sedan poles were copper-wrapped and polished to gleaming brightness. The interior accommodated covered tea bowls, fruits, snacks, and a water pipe—everything needed to while away a long journey. The spacious cabin could comfortably seat two.

Guo Yi had initially felt sitting in such a conveyance was excessively ostentatious. But Shen Fan persuaded him: in the jewelry and curio business, if the proprietor didn't project magnificence, people questioned his status, and the establishment lost face. A degree of luxury was simply proper.

Originally, Guo Yi had considered proposing that the Lingao Carriage Manufacturing Plant produce a batch of high-class carriages for the Guangzhou market. But after surveying local horse prices, he abandoned the notion—horses were shockingly expensive. A few carriages could certainly find buyers, but volumes would remain limited.

"Carriages, carriages... carts without horses won't do—" Guo Yi mused as his body rose and fell with the sedan's rhythm. The motion was familiar by now; he'd grown accustomed to the gentle swaying. His thoughts focused on how to persuade the potential lenders he was about to meet.

The scattered funds he could borrow piecemeal probably wouldn't exceed thirty thousand taels—still a hundred thousand short of the hundred fifty thousand target. Where to find that sum? Guo Yi had puzzled over it extensively, discussing with everyone, but no one could produce a concrete solution.

However, if today's meeting went well, there might be a breakthrough.

The sedan chair halted abruptly. An attendant lifted the curtain and whispered, "Purple Clarity Pavilion lies just ahead. Shall we carry you in—"

"No." Guo Yi knew Purple Clarity Pavilion had become Guangzhou's premier entertainment venue, frequented by numerous dignitaries. Being carried in would attract excessive attention. He wasn't here to parade himself. "Use the rear entrance."

The rear approach offered quieter access and a dedicated sedan hall. Guo Yi's chair was carried directly inside. The Purple Clarity Pavilion steward was already waiting.

"Has the guest arrived?" His first words upon alighting demonstrated how seriously the proprietor took this matter. The steward answered hurriedly, "Replying to Proprietor—not all have arrived yet."

"Take me to see Miss Pei." He hesitated slightly over the title, then accepted it—since she was maintaining a female persona anyway, consistency avoided future complications.

Pei Lixiu's private quarters occupied a small courtyard in the rear building. Flowers and trees grew sparse in the yard; it was a quiet retreat amid the surrounding bustle. Guo Yi was entering these chambers for the first time. No maidservants appeared, but a handsome youth came to greet him and assist with changing clothes.

A year ago, Guo Yi would have been thoroughly uncomfortable, refusing any such attendance. But months in Guangzhou had changed him. His cover identity was that of a major proprietor, and daily life necessarily differed from ordinary folk. As the saying went, environment shapes character. Keeping company with the veteran merchant Shen Fan, dealing constantly with either wealthy or noble personages, he had gradually cultivated the bearing of a prosperous trader. Even his Guangdong Mandarin had slowly shed its twentieth-century inflections. He was learning to inhabit his role.

Without self-consciousness, he let the servant help him change into casual attire and wipe his face with a hot towel. Then he seated himself in the main room. Someone brought clear tea and four plates of tea snacks.

Glancing around, he saw the room was luxurious enough: a complete set of Guangdong rosewood furniture that in another timeline couldn't be purchased for less than a million yuan. Calligraphy and paintings by notable figures hung on every wall—presumably gifts from patrons. Most conspicuous was a floor-standing redwood clock, unique in all Guangzhou. The clock's internal mechanism came from another timeline; only the casing had been crafted by local artisans.

Less harmonious was the kerosene lamp on the table. Though adorned with a handsome shade, the style clashed completely with the room's aesthetic. As for the row of rattan-shelled thermoses on the Fujian lacquered low cabinet—they produced a distinctly disorienting sense of temporal displacement.

The servant went to the curtain and spoke softly: "Proprietor Guo has arrived."

Pei Lixiu opened the curtain herself and emerged gracefully. Managing Purple Clarity Pavilion's numerous affairs had thinned her recently, bringing her closer to this era's aesthetic preferences. A lightly powdered face, eyebrows like brush paintings, eyes sparkling with suppressed animation—she possessed a distinctive exotic allure.

Upon appearing, she first offered a curtsy: "Lixiu greets the Proprietor."

This greeting formally acknowledged Guo Yi as her public employer. Though theater, it was entirely necessary—otherwise, a lone woman of obscure origins operating such a grand establishment would attract endless complications.

Seeing the master arrive, the servant and maids naturally assumed private words required privacy. Without awaiting instructions, they withdrew.

Guo Yi wasted no time on pleasantries and went straight to business, speaking low: "Whom are we meeting?"

"Several wastrel young masters." With no one present, Pei Lixiu abandoned her romantic, graceful manner and sat cross-legged. "I'm exhausted!"

"Watch your posture!" Seeing her reveal her true character, Guo Yi quickly reminded her.

"It's fine—I don't receive guests here. They wouldn't dare intrude." Pei Lixiu stretched. "Got any cigarettes?"

"Where would I find cigarettes for you? You need to be careful in this business—reeking of smoke would be problematic—"

"Hmph, *this business*?" Pei Lixiu turned away in mock offense. "Purple Clarity Pavilion is a respectable, legitimate establishment. How could you say such hurtful things..."

Guo Yi broke into a sweat. The affectation was unbearable; goosebumps erupted instantly.

"All right, I take it back. I don't have cigarettes. Can we discuss business now?"

"Mm." Pei Lixiu produced a linen handkerchief to dab her eyes—a new product from Lingao Textile Factory, woven from local linen blended with high-count long-staple cotton. Light and breathable, the hand feel far surpassed silk.

Luxury and consumer goods developed in Lingao typically went to Guangzhou first, with many receiving priority supply to Purple Clarity Pavilion for brand establishment. Once the wealthy took to them, the broader market would follow—in every era, the rich set consumption trends.
