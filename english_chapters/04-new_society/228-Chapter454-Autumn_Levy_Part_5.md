# Chapter 454 - Autumn Levy (Part 5)

"Third Uncle! This is definitely another new extortion scheme Old Eight has cooked up!" One of his clan nephews, Liu Guangbiao, couldn't contain himself.

Liu Guangbiao had studied business in the prefectural city. He could work an abacus, keep accounts, and understood all sorts of commercial practices—in Lingao, this made him quite an accomplished talent. So the Liu family had simply brought him back to serve as general accountant, managing the family's properties.

Liu Youren said nothing. That Chen Minggang was seizing this opportunity for extortion went without saying. The question was: did the Australians actually intend to conduct a land survey? Was this merely a ploy to intimidate everyone into paying more "Reasonable Burden," or did they genuinely want to ascertain the county's full land holdings and make a complete fresh start, as one would after a dynastic change?

The difference was enormous. If it was just intimidation, the countermeasure was simple enough: pay Chen Minggang a little extra bribe, let him report an additional hundred *mu* or so, and pay a bit more in taxes. But if it was the latter, things would become far more troublesome.

Liu Youren had always been a man of firm opinions, but now he found himself in a quandary. The Australians weren't like the government. They were a more efficient, decisive group that actually dared to get things done—he had seen this clearly long ago. Even "good officials" like Wu Mingjin, when they tried to accomplish something in the county, had never succeeded. The Australians, however, said they would do something and then did it, pushing through countless difficult undertakings. It wouldn't be surprising at all if they truly intended to conduct a thorough county-wide land survey and population census.

The old methods of dealing with officials and bandits wouldn't work on them. Taking a hard line—the Australians weren't afraid of massacring entire households, and would probably welcome the opportunity. Taking a soft approach—the Australians were remarkably incorruptible, immune to monetary bribes.

What exactly did the Australians want? Liu Youren pondered. If they really intended to survey the land, perhaps the wisest choice was to honestly report his family's landholdings. As for the land registered under his family's name on behalf of others, that could wait. But if this was all just bluster, his candor would only benefit the clerks while earning him ridicule—and that embarrassment, he couldn't afford.

"What did Master Zhang say?" he asked. Master Zhang referred to the middleman Zhang Youfu.

"He said he went to inquire, but Chief Wu, who's handling the matter, wasn't home. Nobody else is managing it, and nobody knows anything."

"Not at home." Liu Youren chewed over these words. "Really not at home?" he murmured. These people truly were unfathomable.

"The Tiandihui's—agri—agri—"

"Agricultural technician," Liu Guangbiao supplied.

"Right, has Master Xun arrived yet?" Master Xun was Xun Suji. Because agricultural specialists were in short supply, and he had good expertise in vegetable growing, the Tiandihui had hired him as a part-time agricultural technician—after special training, of course. The Tiandihui people now carried a mystical aura in the eyes of Lingao's common folk, so Ye Yuming preferred to use even half-trained transmigrators rather than native agricultural technicians for now. It was like how, in the early days of Reform and Opening Up, everyone especially trusted foreign goods.

"He only comes on the third days."

Liu Youren calculated—still seven or eight days until his next visit—and felt somewhat disappointed. If this Xun Suji came, he could try to find a way to probe for information about what was happening on the inside, to catch some hint of their intentions.

Unfortunately, ordinary inducements held no interest for them. Liu Youren sighed once again over the transmigrators' bulletproof dedication to honest governance. Officials with authority who didn't accept bribes—this truly took getting used to.

Liu Guangbiao was sharp; he knew the family head was fretting over this matter. He had long had an idea in mind and now felt the moment was ripe.

"Third Uncle!" Liu Guangbiao said carefully. "Meilan from the Fourth Branch is getting on in years. She's tall and sturdy, and hasn't been able to find a suitable husband—"

"Oh!" Liu Youren naturally understood what his nephew was getting at. If the path of money was blocked, perhaps women could work. He had long heard that women were scarce among the Australians, and many of them had no recourse but to watch "secret shadow plays" to relieve themselves...

Liu Youren had previously considered giving Master Xun a maidservant as a token of appreciation. But reflecting on the maidservants of Liu Family Village—unlike the bondmaids of wealthy urban households, these were of peasant origin, toiling all day, with rough hands and feet and sun-darkened skin—Master Xun had never shown the slightest interest in any of them.

In comparison, it would be better to marry off one of the clan's own daughters. A maidservant was ultimately an outsider; once married, she'd have the status of a slave, with no position or respect. But if they actually became in-laws with Xun Suji, he would have to look after his wife's natal family.

Liu Meilan was a girl from the Fourth Branch who, because she had grown tall and robust, had always been mocked—utterly lacking any feminine charm. At nineteen, she still had no suitor. This clan grandniece was worth considering. Her branch held a low position in the clan; even if they were unwilling, they wouldn't dare refuse.

Liu Youren nodded. The cost would be minimal: Meilan's family was from a distant branch. Even if the Australians were later defeated by the government, the main family wouldn't be too heavily implicated. She was a pawn they could afford to sacrifice.

"Good. Go speak with her father!" Liu Youren made up his mind.

"Yes." Liu Guangbiao was secretly pleased. He had another, darker agenda. Liu Meilan had once offended him over a matter involving the collection of memorial rice, and he had long wanted revenge.

"Hmph, this time I'll throw you into the fire pit to taste hot wax." Liu Guangbiao had heard from a native at the East Gate Market who had seen the Australians' "secret shadow plays" that they were extremely depraved in the bedroom: they liked to tie women up like rice dumplings and subject them to various tortures, even dripping hot candle wax or oil onto their naked bodies...

Liu Youren knew nothing of his nephew's dark thoughts. After deliberating a while, he said, "Prepare a visiting card tomorrow. Invite Zhou Qi over."

"Not invite Eighth Master Chen himself?"

---

"I fear I can't command his presence these days." Liu Youren said. "Zhou Qi is his senior apprentice—his word carries the same weight."

"See Eighth Master Chen out." Huang Shoutong called.

"Oh no, no, please don't trouble yourself, Master Huang—" Chen Minggang's face was wreathed in smiles as he left with his retinue.

Huang Shoutong watched them exit through the courtyard gate, then addressed his steward. "Have his underlings all been taken care of?"

"Yes, Master," the steward replied. "Each received three hundred *wen* for 'shoe money,' plus a meal and wine."

"Good, you may go." Huang Shoutong coughed. His second son, Huang Binkun, hurried over to support him. Since being wounded in the counter-attack battle last year, Huang Shoutong's health had declined considerably.

"It's nothing." He waved it off and asked, "Why haven't you been attending lessons at the county school lately?"

"Your son isn't a stipendiary scholar—I was never required to attend regularly anyway."

"That won't do." Huang Shoutong shook his head. "You're still a *xiucai*. You should at least earn a *juren* degree to bring glory to the family."

Huang Binkun smiled bitterly. "Father, you know as well as I do that in the two hundred and some years since the founding of the Great Ming, this entire county hasn't produced ten *juren*. Your son probably doesn't have that kind of fortune."

Huang Shoutong shook his head. "Although luck counts for much in the examination hall, you mustn't grow too dispirited." He returned to the hall in the inner courtyard and sat down. "Right now the county is in turmoil because of the Australians, and everyone is distracted from their studies. The more it's like this, the harder you must work on your lessons, lest you let them go to waste..."

Huang Binkun had expected his father to discuss the Australians' land survey and autumn levy with him. Instead, the opening was a lengthy lecture about studying diligently—he couldn't help wondering if his father was becoming a bit senile.

"Father!" he couldn't help saying. "This autumn levy matter—what do you intend to do?"

"Hmph, these Baldy-bandits—their treasonous hearts are fully exposed." Huang Shoutong struck the table angrily. "A land survey—is that something they're qualified to conduct?!"

"Father, how should we respond?"

"There's something mysterious going on here." Huang Shoutong said. "What kind of Australian enchantment has Old Eight swallowed to make him so eager to stir things up for the Baldies?" He snorted. "Does he think the realm now belongs to the Baldies? Have all principles of Heaven and law ceased to exist?"

"These clerks and runners are nothing but profit-seekers. Father needn't get angry over them."

"The land survey business is just a feint on Old Eight's part." Huang Shoutong said. "He has no real intention of surveying any land. He's using this pretext to pressure everyone into paying more taxes, so he can both please the Australians and make himself a tidy profit."

"Yes, that's my thought as well. The Baldies were probably talked into it by Old Eight, thinking they could collect more grain. Today, Old Eight was quite flexible in his talk. I was thinking of offering him a bit more private benefit, adding a few dozen *shi* to the Reasonable Burden allocated to our village..."

"No, the land survey may be a feint, but the matter isn't that simple." Huang Shoutong waved his hand dismissively. "Do you think the Baldies are people who would be manipulated by the likes of Old Eight?"

"Then what are they after?"

"Grain and taxes are probably not their main objective," Huang Binkun said. "Think about it—how much profit can Lingao really offer? Besides, if they wanted to levy grain, they could just have the liaison officer give the word, and what village would dare refuse? Why go through Old Eight and add extra complications? Their true intentions lie elsewhere."

"Could they be using this opportunity to—"

"Kill the chicken to frighten the monkey!" Huang Shoutong's face was grim. "Using this land survey as a chance to establish their authority! I reckon the small households will get off easy this time—not only easy, but they'll probably even benefit. For major households like us, though, this hurdle won't be easy to cross."

Huang Binkun immediately grew tense. Speaking of which major household in Lingao the Baldies hated most, his own family and Liu Dalin were probably tied for first place. In the past, when opposing the Baldies, one had schemed while the other had personally charged into battle. The Baldies must have long harbored bitter resentment. But Liu Dalin had the distinction of being "the county's only *jinshi*," with extremely high prestige—even the Baldies had to give him some face. The reopening of the Jasmine Pavilion Academy showed that Liu Dalin was a key target for their wooing efforts. In contrast, his own family made an excellent target.
