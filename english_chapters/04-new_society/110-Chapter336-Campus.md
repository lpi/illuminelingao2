# Chapter 336 - Campus

"Not bad," Hu Qingbai laughed. The Ministry of Education's office building was located within the park—a small two-story building with red bricks and red tiles. Moving out of the government compound meant they could strictly possess their own office building without crowding into a few prefab offices.

As soon as one entered the school gate, there was a large stone pedestal, empty on top. Several National School students were climbing on it; seeing "Chiefs" coming, they jumped down one after another and slipped away.

"This is the pedestal for a statue," Mei Wan said. The Ministry of Education originally planned to erect a statue of a great man—but since there was still debate on exactly which great man, it was simply left blank.

The playground was large, a standard 400-meter track field. Equipment like horizontal bars, parallel bars, and climbing poles were all available. A football goal made of wooden frames and fishing nets was also erected. Surprisingly, there was also a basketball court nearby, not only having basketball stands but also made quite decently. Xiao Zishan admired Wu Kuangming, who was in charge of forestry and wood products—standards were getting higher and higher.

However, the students were just walking around, fighting, and playing with equipment on the playground; no one was playing football or basketball.

"No basketballs or footballs?"

"There are a few, found a few from the ship..." Hu Qingbai was about to say "all taken by the General Office," but remembering the person who came was the Director of the General Office, he swallowed the words back. He said, "—Not quite enough. We wanted to make them ourselves, but Mo Xiaoan said applying for rubber reserves to make footballs and basketballs would definitely be rejected."

"Didn't they say ancient China also had football? Gao Qiu was very good at kicking this. Can't we make the Song Dynasty version of football?" Xiao Zishan didn't take the matter of "football equipment" to heart.

"Not the same thing." Hu Qingbai thought to himself that this Director of the General Office was quite good at random associations.

"Can't inflate, no elasticity." Xiao Zishan suddenly thought that the Army often played American football on the training ground as a kind of confrontation training. Last time he went to Yanchang Village, he also saw young people in the village playing American football. For American football, the requirement for the ball wasn't high, and the degree of confrontation was even more intense.

"We can teach everyone to play American football, mm-hmm," Xiao Zishan said. "Xi Yazhou promoted it well in Yanchang Village. And baseball! The equipment isn't hard to make."

"Is the confrontation in American football too intense?" Bai Yu expressed concern. "Children get injured easily."

"American children also play American football." Xiao Zishan waved his hand. "We want to build a 17th-century America!"

This nondescript analogy left everyone speechless. Thinking carefully, actually, the Transmigration Group also had such an intention—World Hegemon, who wouldn't like this title?

So it was decided to list American football and baseball as school sports items. American football would be taught by the Army, and baseball by the Special Reconnaissance Team—Xue Ziliang, as a second-generation Chinese-American, was naturally no stranger to the most popular sports in America.

The whitewash on the newly built teaching building hadn't dried yet, so it hadn't been put into use. The whole buildings were quiet. The level of facilities in the classrooms, in Xiao Zishan's view, was similar to the primary school he attended as a child. The windows opened very wide, installed with glass panes to utilize natural light as much as possible. However, because wooden windows were used, the glass area was on the small side, so the lighting efficiency was slightly weaker.

"No electric lights installed?" Xiao Zishan noticed that positions were reserved on the roof beams and ceilings, but they were empty.

"No, we don't have the technology to manufacture light bulbs. Now light bulb usage control is very strict. The Industrial and Energy Committee said that carbide lamps can be used at night in the future—they can handle this."

Blackboards, desks, and chairs were of standard styles. Except for the front and back blackboards being painted black, all desks and chairs maintained the raw white finish of unpainted wood. However, Xiao Zishan felt it was already very good that Wu Kuangming could make a group of 17th-century migrant workers produce 20th-century furniture.

In the blank space above the blackboard, some slogans very familiar to transmigrators had already been painted on the snow-white plastered wall with ink: "Study Hard, Improve Every Day," "Cultivate One's Moral Character," "Knowledge is Power"... Numerous and varied.

Classroom numbers were nailed to the door of the classrooms. Hu Qingbai said that to increase the utilization efficiency of classrooms, they didn't adopt the one-class-one-classroom mode, but practiced something similar to universities, going to different classrooms for different classes. This could squeeze the utilization efficiency of classrooms to the maximum.

"This significance isn't great, is it?" Xiao Zishan asked. "Leaving aside universities, primary and secondary school students are in class at school from 07:00 to 17:00. Except for time at night, classrooms have almost no free time to utilize."

"No, our education system implements pragmatism." Hu Qingbai was confident. "One-third time for cultural classes, one-third for labor practice classes, one-third for military and physical training classes. So every class will probably have about half the time not using the classroom."

This "Three-Thirds" education system received extremely high praise from Ma Qianzhu. He stated many times in meetings regarding education: "The Fangcaodi teaching experience best embodies the spirit and superiority of the Transmigration Group," "It is a perfect combination of theoretical study and social practice," "It is a good model for cultivating new people with the 'Three Haves'—Ideals, Culture, and Discipline."

The so-called labor practice class was naturally not making paper models with scissors and glue or kneading plasticine, but going to fields and factories to work as real unskilled laborers.

The campus itself also had bases for labor practice: a small farm, including vegetable plots, livestock farms, and a quite sizeable biogas pool—using biogas to cook rice was one aspect; the other purpose was to harmlessly treat the large amount of human waste and organic garbage produced here. Turning it into fertilizer and returning it to the fields on the spot saved the trouble of dealing with large amounts of sewage and filth.

By the riverside of the farm, there was even a simple wind-powered waterwheel for lifting water irrigation. There also stood a row of large and small bamboo sheds of frame structure designed by Bing Feng.

"Many facilities of the farm were built with students' own participation," Hu Qingbai said. "Not only this internship farm but students also participated a lot in the entire campus construction—originally these children attended class in the open air and read books in dormitories; now being able to move into houses, they are all overjoyed, and their labor enthusiasm is high!"

It seemed Hu Qingbai himself was also infected. He said dancing with joy, "Take this simple waterwheel for example; it was made by several students themselves—not bad, right?"

"Indeed not bad. But the waterwheel isn't turning—" Xiao Zishan took a look. The water volume of this branch of the Wenlan River was not large, so the waterwheel didn't rotate.

"It'll be useful when the dam is built later." Hu Qingbai was in high spirits. "This vegetable garden allows students to grow vegetables. The livestock farm is prepared to raise pigs and sheep; feed will use swill from the cafeteria—"

"Swill?" Xiao Zishan had seen indigenous people eat. Judging by their degree of cherishing food, it was hard to say there would be much swill left over—this wasn't a 21st-century university.

"There is still some. Students can supplement feed by planting pigweed and sweet potatoes and cutting hogweed. Raising sheep is even simpler; students just need to cut grass." Hu Qingbai said, "The harvest of the vegetable garden and breeding farm will all be used to subsidize the meals of teachers and students, which can improve the self-sufficiency rate and reduce dependency."

"What about this bamboo shed?" Xiao Zishan walked into a bamboo shed. This shed was almost two stories high, using wholly moso bamboo as the frame and bamboo strip reed mats as walls. The ground was compacted with a mixture of clay and sand. But one couldn't see what use it had.

"This is the location of the school-run factory," Hu Qingbai introduced.

"What does the school-run factory produce?"

"Without power machines, we have to do manual work first. Accept some outsourced processing—Wu Kuangming said to outsource part of the rattan and straw weaving processing to us, and the machinery factory also agreed to help us manufacture a few hand-cranked knitting machines. Making safety helmets and straw hats; what else can be done will be coordinated at meetings."

The next shed was much shorter and smaller. Inside, shelves like bookshelves had been made, arranged neatly.

"This can't be a library, right?" Xiao Zishan couldn't figure out what use this place was prepared for—it was too short and crude for a library.

Everyone laughed. "Preparing to grow some fungi. Oyster mushrooms, wood ear, shiitake, etc... Huang Dashan provides spawn and technical guidance."

"Aren't you afraid of causing technology proliferation?"

"It doesn't matter if cultivation technology proliferates; one can even say the more it proliferates, the better. Just control the spawn. This is Huang Dashan's patent."

"Let's go to the library now."

To Xiao Zishan's surprise, the library was actually a luxurious two-story small building with a reinforced concrete structure and a pointed roof. The grey reinforced concrete structural beams and columns seemed particularly abrupt inlaid in the red brick walls of the house. From the outside, the house was heavily guarded; not only were iron bars installed on windows, but there were also iron sheet-clad shutters. The door was also clad with iron sheet and installed with modern locks.

"The things here are particularly valuable, that's why it's so luxurious." Mei Wan unlocked it while speaking. "Otherwise I wouldn't agree to build with reinforced concrete."

This was a building serving as both library and laboratory. The library was located on the well-ventilated second floor. The reading room was bright. In the spacious stacks, rows of newly made bookshelves were temporarily still empty, only containing some thread-bound books bought from Guangzhou, classics and histories, and a portion of newly printed textbooks and monthly bound volumes of *Lingao Times*. Textbooks were a big problem. Zhou Dongtian was still researching with people from the chemical department to solve the printing press ink problem for large-scale book printing. Once solved, the books here would be replenished quickly.

The first floor consisted of four laboratories for Physics, Chemistry, and Biology, completely configured according to middle school laboratory standards, and related equipment storage rooms. What shocked Xiao Zishan especially was that there was actually an Electrical Laboratory! Xiao Zishan didn't manage the Planning Committee's work, but he also knew how precious the electrical equipment installed in the laboratory was to the transmigrators now.
