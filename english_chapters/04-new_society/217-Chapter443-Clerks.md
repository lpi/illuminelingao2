# Chapter 443 Clerks

Lingao's commodity economy level was very poor. There was little silver circulating in the market, so silver prices were relatively high, while grain prices were low. Collecting taxes in silver inevitably meant collecting much more grain. The price difference between incoming and outgoing seemed minute, but when accumulated, the figures became very large.

The total taxable official land in Lingao was 1,660 *qing* and 98 *mu*. Levying 9 *li* per *mu* meant roughly 15,000 taels of silver. Although some land was taxed at 4 *li* and some was exempt, the total would still be nearly 10,000 taels. For such a small county town, the burden of surcharges was almost unbearably large.

So when it came time to collect grain, the silver price would rise very high. This was not only a huge burden for grain-paying households but also not easy for the county. In the past, without surcharges, paying grain tax was somewhat easier. Since the first surcharge at the end of the Wanli reign, the county yamen had to urge grain tax collection and collect silver, running themselves ragged.

What made it most difficult for Wu Mingjin and others was that Lingao was far from the emperor's reach, and the county yamen's authority was very limited. Not to mention the county gentry, even ordinary local landlords who built forts for self-protection paid taxes quite arbitrarily. The government simply couldn't ask too many questions. As for the countless "hidden fields" reclaimed privately, they were impossible to count.

However, in the past, relying on Wu Mingjin's methods and Wang Zhaomin's running around, Lingao's autumn tax could finally be completed on time. Last year, although the Australians came, the other party didn't interfere much with the autumn tax collection, so this task was managed. Later, although a "reasonable burden" was implemented, that had nothing to do with the county yamen.

This year's situation was somewhat subtle. The Australians openly reclaimed wasteland and planted crops themselves. Wang Zhaomin had a great hidden worry.

What hidden worry? This brings us to "proxy registration" (*guiji*). Some families, to evade government taxes, often adopted the method of bringing their land to "cast themselves under a master," registering under the name of a landlord with an examination degree or power. Actually, tax exemptions in the Ming dynasty had clear regulations—officials of certain ranks were exempt for so much, *juren* for so much, *shengyuan* for so much. But in actual operation, it often greatly exceeded the set rules. In Lingao, there was no lack of such examples. There weren't many gentry with degrees in Lingao, but there were many powerful landlords. "Proxy registering" under powerful landlords wasn't legally exempt from tax, but for the county yamen, a basic principle for local officials was not to offend the county's big households. They often had to turn a blind eye to the collected figures. Generally speaking, both sides managed to get by.

Now the Australians were considered the top powerful household in Lingao County. If they openly refused to pay a single grain of rice, and the county yamen was helpless about it, many small and medium landlords or independent farmers who were watching might cast themselves under their door. Lingao's autumn tax collection would shrink significantly. This was a very bad omen for both Wu Mingjin and Wang Zhaomin—it not only concerned Wu Mingjin's performance evaluation but also both their pockets. For local officials, the benefits of floating collection and surcharges on taxes were a reliable and risk-free income.

After much thought, Wang Zhaomin proposed that the only way was to negotiate with the Australians and ask them to set an example. Judging by the Australians' performance over the past year, they didn't want to be enemies with the Great Ming government and were sometimes even willing to spend money to buy a good image. So as long as the price was right, the other party wouldn't necessarily refuse sternly.

How could Xiong Buyou know his calculations? He was pondering what the other party actually meant.

"This county's grain tax is very light," Wang Zhaomin said quickly, seeing him pretending to ponder. "The official levy is only three *dou* five *sheng* per *mu*. For your several thousand *mu* of land, Bairen Village just needs to start with a tax for five hundred *mu*."

Xiong Buyou shook his head: "Private Secretary Wang, I have to report this matter to the Executive Committee before I can give you a reply."

"Naturally." Wang Zhaomin was overjoyed to see there was room for discussion, thanking him repeatedly. If he didn't already know clearly that these Hair Bandits were impervious to oil and salt, he probably would have promised him a heavy benefit.

Xiong Buyou hurriedly reported to Wu De after returning. This matter immediately aroused Wu De's high attention, so the Executive Committee immediately held a meeting to discuss it.

"This is a good thing delivered to our door!" Wen Desi beamed with delight. "I was thinking about how to persuade them, but they delivered themselves to our door!"

"That's not the same thing, is it?" Ma Qianzhu immediately sang a different tune. "He wants us to pay grain tax, not asking us to farm taxes."

"Although it's not the same thing, Wang Zhaomin has exposed his bottom," Wen Desi used a vulgar metaphor.

"Originally we didn't know how much pressure Lingao County faced regarding grain collection. Now it seems their pressure is huge." Wen Desi analyzed, "Judging from Wang Zhaomin's request, it at least exposes serious difficulties in the Lingao County Yamen's grain collection."

Since there were difficulties in grain collection, the Crossing Group had much to work with.

However, they were still completely in the dark about exactly where the difficulty lay. Before taking the next step, they had to figure out the county yamen's cards.

For this kind of thing, naturally, asking the clerk of the "Revenue Section" in the county yamen was the most direct way.

But this wasn't easy. In the county yamen, there were the so-called "Three Classes and Six Rooms." The heads of these three classes and the clerks of the six rooms were not easy to deal with. Only the clerks were familiar with the grassroots affairs of yamen large and small. This was their "capital." The true situation, as well as keys and tricks, were secrets not passed to outsiders. So although there was no written rule for "hereditary" clerks, invisible father-to-son transmission formed a hereditary custom. These people were all seasoned old clerks, familiar with official business to the extreme, and also well-versed in worldly wisdom and officialdom philosophy. Transmigrators couldn't control or buy them off at all, so the Executive Committee's policy toward this group was to first appease them for use, and thoroughly purge them once the time was ripe.

The clerk of the Revenue Section in Lingao County was named Chen Minggang, a local. It was said his ancestors had been clerks in Lingao County since the Song dynasty. His family held many secret books passed down, and he was extremely familiar with county affairs. Everyone had to give him face; he was a figure who could really get things done locally. Gou Da and Gou Er ran wild in Lingao, and Chen Minggang had received huge benefits—actually, in Ran Yao's view, gangs like Gou Da and Gou Er might seem clamorous and powerful for a time, but eradicating them wasn't hard; once they fell, they scattered. Figures like Chen Minggang, deeply rooted and intertwined, were the true "invisible black hands behind the scenes."

In the county, he was also an indispensable favorite. That Wang Zhaomin could collect the autumn grain every year owed much to Chen Minggang. In fact, whether one could establish a good cooperative relationship with the county Revenue Section clerk directly affected whether the Magistrate's tenure would be smooth.

Therefore, even Wang Zhaomin, a powerful figure in the county, had to affectionately call him "Old Eight" when seeing Chen Minggang—Chen Minggang was the eighth in his generation, implying familiarity without standing on ceremony.

Because the Revenue Section clerk concerned the entire county's taxes, he was an extremely critical figure. Wu De had always wanted to win him over, sending Xiong Buyou to socialize with him several times, and Lin Baiguang had also gone out to face him, but the results were unsatisfactory.

Chen Minggang wasn't an upright person, nor could he be said to have a stance. his attitude was slippery to the extreme. Towards the Transmigrators, he tried his best to be perfunctory. Whatever request or matter, he never delayed, nor did he demand various customary fees. It could be said he gave 120 percent face. But when it involved critical issues, especially land quantity and tax burden, he always played dumb, saying half and hiding half, sometimes simply rambling with obscure terminology, leaving the Transmigrators confused.

In the Political Security Bureau's dossiers, Chen Minggang had a lot of black materials. It could be said he was one of the clerks with the greatest popular indignation in the county, even more guilty of heinous crimes than the clerk of the Punishment Section. Zhang Xingjiao also hated this person to the bone—after all, his family's ruin started precisely from the Revenue Section colluding with Gou Da and Gou Er to play the trick of "property gone, tax remains."

But now, the Transmigrators still had to use him for a stage. Xiong Buyou immediately had someone prepare a card inviting Chen Minggang to a chat at the teahouse in front of the county yamen.

Generally speaking, the street in front of the county yamen was always the busiest place in the county, and there were always a few businesses like teahouses opposite the yamen. Here, there were "scribes" specially issued "stamps" by the government to write petitions and complaints for people as a profession, and also experienced pettifoggers who hooked three sides, all customarily nesting in the teahouse in front of the yamen waiting for customers or looking for business opportunities. Yamen clerks, runners, long-term attendants, and private secretaries of all kinds also mostly used this place to communicate news, negotiate, collude in fraud, and haggle with the outside world. To get things done at the county yamen, this was the best window.

Lingao County was a small county without so many tricks, but the general situation was about the same, just on a smaller scale. So although the teahouse was small, it existed.

Xiong Buyou was already a "celebrity" in this county. Who didn't know he was the big boss of the Australians specialized in contacting the county? So as soon as he arrived at the shop, a waiter immediately led him to a private room in the back.

Though called a private room, it was extremely small, just holding a table and a few chairs, and the tea wasn't necessarily high quality. Anyway, people came to drink tea mainly to discuss matters; drinking tea was secondary.

When Xiong Buyou dealt with county clerks, he generally met here, mainly because it was an environment familiar to the clerks, enough to make them feel at ease. Additionally, the Executive Committee had another layer of concern: they didn't want to call clerks directly to Bairen City for secret talks, to avoid outsiders thinking the Crossing Group had too deep a relationship with local clerks. Talking in this place for "eating negotiation tea" and "talking terms" was more suitable.

Not long after, Chen Minggang arrived. He was near fifty, with a dark face and a slightly stout figure. constrained by status, his dress wasn't very splendid, but the material and workmanship were very exquisite. He held a Sichuan fan in his hand.

The waiter led him in. Chen Minggang's attitude toward the Transmigrators could be described as respectful and submissive; he bowed every time they met.

"No need for ceremony, sit! Sit!" Xiong Buyou greeted.

*(The following is beyond 3000 words, not charged)*
*Notes:*
*1. Liao Supplies surcharge in the 2nd year of Chongzhen was 9 li, though it varied slightly by region. Not delving into details.*
*2. I couldn't find the exact Liao Supplies surcharge for Lingao. Calculating directly using Lingao's taxable acreage here is definitely inaccurate. I found a figure for Yancheng County in Huai'an Prefecture: Liao Supplies in the 3rd year of Tianqi were 23,000 taels. Yancheng wasn't an economically developed area, but certainly much better than Lingao.*
*3. The tax of three dou five sheng is the average level in the Ming dynasty. Checking Qiongzhou Prefecture's levy standards, there are eighteen grades. Three dou five sheng is the most common. So I used this figure.*
