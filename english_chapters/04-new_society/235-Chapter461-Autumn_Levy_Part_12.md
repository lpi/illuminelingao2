# Chapter 461 - Autumn Levy (Part 12)

Though he spoke these words, the hatred in his heart grew ever stronger. This was almost certainly the work of the Baldies colluding with people in the county yamen! His heart was now filled with hatred not only toward the transmigrators, but toward the entire county.

"Wu Mingjin, just you wait!" he gnashed his teeth. "You worthless traitor who colludes with the Baldies!"

The Lai brothers didn't dare make a sound. They understood perfectly well how important the *xiucai* title was. Without this protective umbrella, the young master was now nothing but a common "grass-folk."

---

After encountering Gou Chengxuan, Huang Binkun's emotions were in turmoil. Gou Chengxuan had returned to the county seat to take revenge on the Baldies. By risking exposure to reveal himself, he had clearly calculated that Huang Binkun wouldn't betray him—the scoundrel's ability to read people's hearts was quite accurate!

His purpose in appearing was obviously to ally with him against the Baldies. Whether to join forces with him, Huang Binkun couldn't quite decide. But recalling the recent revocation of Gou Chengxuan's *xiucai* status, he began to perceive the underlying connection—the Baldies were determined to eliminate Gou Er and his son at all costs. The two sides were irreconcilable enemies. If he got entangled with Gou Chengxuan and the matter came to light, Huang Family Village would become the second Gou Family Manor!

At this thought, Huang Binkun broke into a cold sweat. Though he didn't understand concepts like "antagonistic contradictions" versus "contradictions among the people," he at least understood that hatreds came in different levels. For now, there was no need for him to martyr himself for righteousness.

In the end, he decided to ignore Gou Chengxuan for the time being. Since he was in the city, he could always be found if needed. Besides, regardless of whether they joined forces, Gou Chengxuan would inevitably cause trouble for the Australians.

While Huang Binkun was busy campaigning, Chen Minggang and his gang hadn't been idle either. By the time the second deadline passed, they had already negotiated terms with most of the county's major households. Naturally, this process was filled with threats, promises, and bribes...

Chen Minggang reviewed the account books his grain runners had submitted and felt quite pleased. This time, not a single gentry family or major household had dared refuse their demands. There was bargaining, of course, but all within the range he was willing to concede. Chen Minggang had been careful not to squeeze the major households too hard—how long the Australians would stay was still uncertain, and this was only his first time working for them.

This "land survey," without lifting a finger, had added nearly ten thousand *mu* of assessable land. Not counting tribute rice, just based on the government's standard basic rate of three *dou* five *sheng* per *mu*, this meant an extra three thousand and several hundred *shi* of grain out of thin air. This substantial gift would surely delight the Australians beyond expectation. His contract for next year was as good as secured!

His own take was equally rich. The one *dou* per *shi* surcharge alone would net close to a thousand *shi* this year! This was a fortune beyond anything he'd dared imagine before. In the past, major households often didn't pay their full tribute rice—some even evaded the basic levy. This time, not only was the tribute rice collected in full, but no one dared openly refuse the additional *dou*. Let alone all the various benefits collected in connection with negotiating land reporting amounts. The oil-shiny faces of the grain runners told him everyone had made a killing—though naturally, he had gotten the most.

However, as Chen Minggang flipped toward the back of the ledger, his expression gradually darkened. He finished the book, sat in his chair for a long time, brow furrowed as if pondering something. His young page servant under the eaves knew this was the prelude to a tantrum and quickly moved out of harm's way.

Just then, Umbrella-Shop Little Hu arrived. Chen Minggang glanced at the accounts he had submitted and praised him a few times. Little Hu's face was wreathed in smiles. Despite his lame leg, he bowed repeatedly and lavished flattery on Chen Minggang.

Though Umbrella-Shop Little Hu had a limp, his wits were sharper than most. He had apprenticed at an umbrella shop from childhood, then ingratiated himself with a grain runner and learned all the tricks of the trade. Being a grain runner required, first, ruthlessness—orphans and widows kneeling before you in supplication couldn't stop you from taking their last *he* of rice; second, physical stamina—collecting taxes meant traveling the countryside, braving the elements, sleeping rough, and sometimes getting into bloody fights. Someone without a strong constitution couldn't handle this work. Little Hu was at a disadvantage physically. Ruthlessness alone couldn't earn him a place in this profession. His ability lay mainly in "knowing the numbers"—no matter how irregularly shaped a plot was, a skilled grain runner could size it up at a glance and know exactly how many *mu* and *fen* it was, assess the condition of the rice, estimate the yield. This skill came only from hands-on experience, plus some basic geometry and arithmetic. Most grain runners lacked this ability.

Having apprenticed in business from childhood, Little Hu had some foundation. Combined with his diligence, he had become known in the trade for "knowing the numbers." Even Chen Minggang admitted his field-assessment skills were superior.

Perhaps because of his disability, Little Hu harbored an especially intense desire to climb higher. Of course, in the grain runner profession, upward mobility was virtually nonexistent. No matter how skilled you were, everyone was just a lackey of the Household Clerk. Little Hu's goal was to become the foremost lackey—in other words, Chen Minggang's confidant.

Chen Minggang's most trusted people were naturally his apprentices. But among these apprentices, Little Hu knew that only Zhou Qi had any chance of inheriting the mantle; the others were merely errand boys. Umbrella-Shop Little Hu's objective was to dislodge Zhou Qi.

Zhou Qi had been serving Chen Minggang since childhood; master and apprentice had deep ties. He couldn't be easily toppled by a few slanderous words. But ever since Chen Minggang had taken Qiuhong as his mistress, Little Hu knew his opportunity had come. He was savvy about tactics—ordinarily, he would only drop cold water at critical moments, seeming casual but ensuring Chen Minggang took careful notice. Add to this the fact that Zhou Qi had never been in good standing with his master, with no hope of inheriting the clerkship, and occasionally let slip some complaints. Some of these words had reached Chen Minggang's ears. Gradually, Chen Minggang had begun to distrust this apprentice.

Noticing Chen Minggang's displeased expression, Little Hu's mind stirred. "Eighth Master! Is something the matter?"

"Hmph," Chen Minggang's face immediately darkened. "Secretly currying favor! Did he think I wouldn't find out?!"

---

Umbrella-Shop Little Hu now understood exactly what was happening. Lately, there had been rumors on the streets that Zhou Qi had been lining his own pockets during this "land survey" farce—the major households were obviously willing to give him benefits because he had gone easy on them during the negotiations. Chen Minggang was probably fuming over this.

So he feigned ignorance. "The major households have all been crying and complaining, saying this 'land survey' is flaying them alive..."

"Flaying? Pulling a few hairs off them and they cry to high heaven." Chen Minggang was dismissive. "And now I haven't even managed to pull a few hairs! He actually dares deceive me! A good-for-nothing who can't accomplish anything but can certainly ruin things."

Now he was one hundred percent certain this was about Zhou Qi. He affected an alarmed expression. "Eighth Master, all of us work honestly and would never dare deceive you. If there really is someone so treacherous as to betray his master, none of us would tolerate him!"

Originally, Chen Minggang had only been angry about Zhou Qi selling favors behind his back. Now, with Little Hu's phrasing—"betray his master"—his fury intensified. Remembering the recent street rumors, especially the gossip about Zhou Qi and Qiuhong, his disgust for this apprentice grew even deeper.

"Mm!" Chen Minggang nodded and said, "You may go now!"

"Yes!" Umbrella-Shop Little Hu, seeing Chen Minggang's expression had darkened considerably, knew his poison had been administered at just the right dose. Secretly pleased, he quickly withdrew.

Zhou Qi remained completely oblivious. His generous treatment of major households during this "land survey" was indeed fact. For all these years, he had run about on Chen Minggang's behalf, and in the end he hadn't even gotten himself a wife. He had little savings. Moreover, his master was now suspicious of him over the Qiuhong affair—though the truth was, nothing had happened between him and Qiuhong. Touching his master's woman was beyond Zhou Qi's nerve. Years ago, a county hoodlum had been tied to a rock and drowned in the river just for flirting with an itinerant actress that his master had fancied.

Qiuhong or no Qiuhong, Zhou Qi wasn't particularly interested—though the woman did have an alluring look about her. As for silver, this land survey had brought him plenty of benefits. What Zhou Qi worried most about was his future.

His master had three sons. Unless they all suddenly died, the clerkship would never come to him. Chen Minggang's eldest son had already come of age, and his attitude toward Zhou Qi was merely cordial, not warm. This young master of the clerkship naturally had his own circle of hangers-on. When the time came, Zhou Qi might not even be welcome to curry favor.

He was past thirty—halfway through his life by any measure. Whether he could even beg for scraps from this junior apprentice-brother in the future was uncertain. The junior apprentice-brother was indifferent to him, and the master's wife even more so. Having always helped the master with his womanizing, the master's wife had long despised Zhou Qi and never showed him a friendly face. Thinking of the Zhang brothers from the mistress's family, Zhou Qi's prospects seemed even bleaker.

If he wanted to continue making a living in Lingao after his master passed on, Zhou Qi had resolved to maintain good relations with the major households. They had been here for generations. Good relationships with them meant he'd always be able to eat, no matter what he ended up doing.

Of course, he had also considered ingratiating himself with the Australians. But Zhou Qi felt the Australians might not stay long—if they blew through like a typhoon and were gone, all his efforts would be wasted.

For this reason, during this land survey, he had done his best to accommodate the major households. The figures his master had given him always settled at the minimum threshold. He figured that since the threshold had been set by his master, meeting it should satisfy him without any complaints. The grateful gifts from the major households had been generous as well.

With the task more than half done and proceeding smoothly, Zhou Qi felt quite pleased. With some cash in hand, he made a special trip to the East Gate Market to relax—eating, drinking, and calling on a girl to ease the weariness of these busy days.
