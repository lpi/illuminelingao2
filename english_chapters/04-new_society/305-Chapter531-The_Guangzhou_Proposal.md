# Chapter 531 - The Guangzhou Proposal

"Where exactly do we get this 'sand' from? Being an escort requires specialized training; you can't just round up any refugees to do the job," Zhang Yuchen asked.

"Not ordinary refugees, of course—proper personnel trained in Lingao," Yan Maoda said. "Isn't there an escort from Rising Power named Zhou Shizhai, currently serving as a guest adviser in the Public Security department? Boss Sun speaks highly of him; he knows all the tricks of the escort trade. Let him handle the professional training. The men we train will gradually be inserted as we establish 'external counters,' and eventually we'll break up that little Jiangxi clique inside Rising Power Escort Agency. Some of them should ideally be absorbed into other departments in Lingao."

"No need to worry about Rising Power getting ideas. We control the finances right now. What good does their solidarity do? The moment Delon freezes their accounts, Rising Power shuts down," Meng Xian said, unconsciously stroking the whiskers he had just begun to grow. As the increasingly prominent chief manager of Delon Bank in Guangzhou, he had to look more mature—lest major clients find him too young and unreliable.

"Who freezes their own account?" Zhang Xin laughed. "Old Yan, are you being paranoid? Rising Power today is nothing like the old Rising Power. Without our management, Sun Kecheng probably can't even keep track of all the enterprises under Rising Power's name, let alone run them."

The "external-counter" properties under Rising Power's banner—inns, restaurants, warehouses, logistics, shipping—were now under Yan Maoda's control. Escort agencies traditionally operated ancillary businesses like warehouses and mule-and-horse inns, but neither their business philosophy nor their management could compare with modern people. As the Guangzhou Station continuously expanded its investments, this segment had been completely taken over by Yan Maoda. Sun Kecheng did not mind—after all, he and his people were martial-arts men, with little aptitude for commerce. As long as the Australian managers were willing to invest and expand Rising Power, he could sit back and share in the profits while finding decent jobs for his townsmen, relatives, and fellow disciples. Why not?

"Exactly!" Meng Xian said brashly. "Financial and managerial authority are both in our hands. Sun Kecheng only controls the escort corps."

"I never said Rising Power would get ideas. Old Sun is very reliable. But local cliques are harmful to the whole," Yan Maoda said, picking up a water pipe. In Guangzhou's wealthy households, fashionable paper cigarettes were already in vogue, but Yan Maoda had gone native and switched to a water pipe. This one alone was worth over fifty taels: the finest white copper, engraved with intricate patterns, inlaid with small pearls, crystals, and agates—all crafted by the jewelers of Purple Treasure Studio for their own boss. Since it was winter, a delicate Eight-Treasure openwork embroidered silk cover slipped over it—painstakingly stitched in imitation of palace patterns over a month by Yan Maoda's chambermaid.

He took up a paper spill, hand-rolled by the maidservants and scented with jasmine, lit it from a candle, and lit the pipe himself—outside, a young servant would handle this task; in the mansion, a personal maid; but in the safe house, no one could put on airs; everyone did things themselves. He took a few puffs, exhaled smoke, and continued:

"Rising Power's situation has to be resolved. This whole crew of escorts is now deployed across our various enterprises for security work. Whether they're reliable is critical." He took another drag. "There's another consideration. We sell so-called 'Australian goods'; our connection to Australian merchants—or that we ourselves are Australians—is already an open secret among Guangzhou's wealthy. The moment Lingao clashes with the Great Ming, Rising Power's stance becomes uncertain! If they turn on us—though Boss Sun and his core brothers are honorable, the agency's scale has expanded so fast that too many new people have come in; there's no telling if a few rogues have slipped in—or if Sun is forced to distance himself from us, our entire network in Guangdong is finished."

The other three nodded. This was indeed a worrying matter. Zhang Xin said, "I think we need to standardize a few talking points. First, we are not Australians—that must be stated categorically."

This needed no elaboration; everyone knew the stakes. Besides, they now had formal Great Ming household registrations. To continue claiming to be some kind of overseas person would only invite trouble.

"Second, regarding the source of the Australian goods—there's no need to hide it; it comes from Lingao. The news of Lingao's great iron ship and the Gaoguang Shipping runs between the two places is no longer much of a secret in the Guangzhou area."

Guo Yi said, "We've all thought about this. I wonder if we should split Rising Power up a bit, rather than hanging everything under its banner. Rising Power's ties to the three Purple-family enterprises in Guangzhou are too close; any observer can see our special relationship with them." He sipped his cold tea. "If the Guangzhou Station ever has to go underground or withdraw, Rising Power will certainly be implicated."

Yan Maoda nodded. "Right! Going forward, our national expansion should not use the Rising Power name either. Once we've openly broken with the Great Ming, we should quickly take Guangdong and Guangxi, but pushing further north won't happen overnight."

The group pondered how to reorganize Rising Power. Zhang Xin said, "Why don't we submit a reorganization proposal for Rising Power at the General Assembly?"

"That's off-topic," Meng Xian waved dismissively. "The Assembly is for electing a new Executive Committee and setting grand policy. What grand policy does Rising Power Escort Agency count as? That's operational detail."

"Whether it counts or not, bringing a few proposals is better than arriving empty-handed," Guo Yi said. "It shows we take the General Assembly seriously."

Yan Maoda smiled. "Actually, we have a much better proposal." He paused. "It's about Xiao Guo's status—and the other people swept in by accident. They can't stay 'temporary' forever; there should be a formal ruling."

Zhang Xin nodded repeatedly. "Yes, yes—now that's a major issue."

Meng Xian said, "I absolutely support Guo Yi receiving the same treatment as everyone else: voting rights and shareholding. Anyone who disagrees can go screw themselves."

"Xiao Meng, that's not appropriate…" Hearing Meng Xian curse on his behalf, Guo Yi feared he might let it slip at the Assembly and seriously damage his own reputation.

"Given the Guangzhou Station's record over the past year and more, everyone can see. If someone with such great contributions still can't be called a comrade, who can?" Yan Maoda said. "Anyone who opposes your equal rights, I'd say, is thoroughly rotten."

Pepi parted her cherry lips: "Xiao Guo is the best. Why shouldn't he get equal treatment? If anyone makes trouble, I'll go find Director Ma!" With that, she swayed her slender waist and struck a pouting pose.

Zhang Xin laughed. "Exactly. Xiao Guo has long deserved this qualification. In my view, the two from ATF and the four members of the Ming family should also have equal rights. Never mind the size of their contributions—we all came on the same boat. As long as someone isn't actively sabotaging, in this timeline we should all be in the same boat. There's no reason to artificially distinguish 'permanent' from 'temporary.'"

Zhang Yuchen said, "I agree. We've crossed into another timeline—are we really still going to have regular workers and temporary workers?"

Guo Yi was momentarily touched by his comrades and offered a few words of thanks. Then he said, "What worries me is that some people at this General Assembly may try to make an issue of our living standards. Does anyone have a strategy for that? If someone raises questions at the Assembly, we need an answer."

Everyone around the table fell silent. In terms of creature comforts, the Guangzhou Station staff were probably the best-off among all transmigrators—including the newcomer Meng Xian. Because they all posed as major merchants, their lifestyles naturally could not appear shabby, and all the necessary trappings were in place. As for the woman problem—the issue causing the greatest uproar—in Guangzhou it was not even an issue. Apart from Guo Yi, who was relatively cautious and had taken in only one chambermaid, Yan Maoda and Zhang Xin had each taken two chambermaids. Meng Xian, young and vigorous with strong appetites, had already taken in four maids and concubines. Zhang Yuchen, having feelings for Zhang Yu, had secretly taken in only one.

"According to Zhang Yu, Chang Shide in Leizhou has become a target for many people—just because he has several women around him," Zhang Yuchen said. "Some are accusing him of embezzlement—buying women with public funds, using public position for private gain, and so on. The fire is intense. Someone has already proposed a hearing, demanding he explain the matter in person. When the Assembly convenes, he'll have a tough time getting through."

"To be honest, Old Chang's situation is nothing!" Zhang Xin was indignant on his behalf. "How much could a few women have cost him? Besides, opening a station in Leizhou was always going to require buying some servants for housework—it's just incidental. I'll say something that doesn't sound nice: if you don't sleep with a woman a few times and 'break her in,' she'll feel you don't trust her."

Meng Xian nodded vigorously. "Shiba! (This is a Korean exclamation.) Exactly right. Take my maids—before I bedded them, they were all like wooden dummies…"

Pepi wrinkled her brow. "Too vulgar. All this 'bedded' talk—can't you men talk about something else?"

"That's the point," Zhang Xin said with a careless wave. "Even where we came from—if a couple dating reaches a certain point and doesn't go to bed, can you really say there's feeling?"

"Old Chang is like us. Having women around is normal; not having them would be strange," Yan Maoda said. "I think this is something we should remind the new leadership about—don't split hairs on this issue."
