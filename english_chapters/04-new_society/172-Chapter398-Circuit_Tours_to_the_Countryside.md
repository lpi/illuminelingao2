# Chapter 398 - Circuit Tours to the Countryside

Fortified compounds like Liu Family Stockade were common in Lingao and throughout contemporary China. These strongholds had strong independence—paying taxes and grain levies in full to government, but government could barely manage internal affairs. When the transmigrator collective convened the Political Consultative Conference, Liu Family Stockade likewise sent representatives and elected liaisons; delivering grain and providing laborers, they appeared very compliant. When comprehensive rural bandit suppression began, Liu Family Stockade politely refused work team residence, but cooperated well with suppression—whether summoning militia for duty or providing supplies, they responded instantly. Work teams and the Army conducting suppression found nothing to criticize.

But such compliance didn't satisfy the transmigrator collective—their ideal social form was absolute grassroots control. Though these strongholds wouldn't oppose any ruler's demands, they were subjects with zero loyalty, closing gates to rule themselves. Whether bandits, Imperial troops, or transmigrators, all received the same treatment. This had positive effects for local stability. The downside: once situations changed, they'd switch sides faster than turning pages. Rulers could hardly view them as stable rear-area foundations.

"Without securing rural strongholds, we're just Sengoku daimyo." Wen Desi stated at the Civil Affairs work meeting. "These stronghold masters are outwardly obedient but secretly may be colluding with bandits, pirates, and government. At the slightest disturbance, they'd immediately turn against us!"

Now that Liu Youren had personally come for training, Wu De decided immediately after consulting Wu Nanhai: send the most capable people into Liu Family Stockade for agricultural guidance and social work. Break through from this angle, gradually winning over these semi-independent rural strongholds to ally with the transmigrator collective.

"We've also opened an agricultural supply store for everyone. Interested parties can visit the first floor and see what's needed." Wu Nanhai said mysteriously. "Just received a batch of farm tools..."

The training attendees immediately emptied the classroom—Lingao iron tools were scarce goods. Besides, these were Australian tools, renowned for quality and craftsmanship. Getting one was not only useful but impressive among neighbors.

The Heaven and Earth Society agricultural supply store occupied the Society's first floor, door facing the street, neatly organized. Various agricultural supplies were displayed—all recently produced by the Machinery Factory and Woodworking Factory for the agricultural promotion campaign. Nothing yet counted as "game-changing"—only familiar items were displayed. But modern industrial manufacturing's advantages in quality, appearance, and design still mesmerized indigenous customers.

"Same hoe, but the Australian one looks so refined." Fu Buer marveled.

"So refined—might not be durable though?" someone doubted.

"Not durable? Australian goods' quality and toughness are famous."

"Right—look at this steel edge. Much better than Blacksmith Li's hoes in town—his hoes are so brittle! They chip right away."

"I'll take this one, and this, and this—"

"Never mind—I'll take three of everything." This from someone wealthy.

Some without money could only hang back watching, faces full of envy, pockets empty. Such fine goods surely weren't cheap—even Blacksmith Li's crude ironwork wasn't cheap, let alone these.

"This batch totals only fifty pieces. Each household limited to four, one of each type." Ye Yuming said.

A collective sigh of disappointment.

"Four it is then. How much silver?"

"No silver." Ye Yuming said. "This store only accepts Lingao Grain Circulation Vouchers."

Everyone was dumbfounded. Circulation vouchers—they all knew about these. Australian paper currency. Outside East Gate Market and surrounding areas, nobody used them—a piece of paper as money felt unreliable.

"Can't use silver?"

"No—vouchers only." Ye Yuming smiled warmly.

Murmuring below, then someone proposed exchanging silver for vouchers.

"Silver can't be exchanged for vouchers, but grain can." Ye Yuming said. "Visit Delong Grain Exchange—one *jin* of rough rice equals one yuan."

Immediately some ordered servants and hired hands to hurry home for grain to exchange at East Gate Market. Not everyone had silver, but grain was plentiful for medium-small landlords and rich peasants. Iron tool prices weren't cheap—store prices ranged from 50 to 100 yuan.

For those who couldn't immediately produce rice for vouchers—like Lu Da's group, and some whose land was adequate but circumstances had created cash-flow problems—Grain Exchange Manager Yan Ming, waiting nearby, immediately promoted Delong's micro-agricultural loans. Fully considering farmer ability and acceptance, Yan Ming's loans were unsecured, charged monthly interest at 2%, with principal and interest due in one lump sum after autumn harvest.

Such interest roughly matched current Lingao rural lending market levels—middle-to-low range. Yan Ming believed this interest wouldn't burden planting-plan participants with heavy repayment pressure.

Delong lent vouchers and collected vouchers. If borrowers lacked vouchers for repayment, they'd first need to exchange grain for vouchers at Delong. This extra step was actually the Finance Department's strategy: using lending to forcibly expand voucher circulation. Even having vouchers pass through indigenous hands for a few minutes gave them experience and confidence using vouchers.

Yan Ming talked himself hoarse for five or six minutes, but still no response below. This sudden good fortune left everyone uncertain. Nobody dared be the first to try—borrowing from Shorn Bandits couldn't be the same as borrowing from neighbors. Everyone had such concerns.

Finally, unable to resist iron tools' temptation, with Yan Ming's repeated guarantees and Zhang Youfu's pledge that there were absolutely no tricks—plus the transmigrator collective's carefully cultivated credibility in Lingao—the remaining people finally took loans. Yan Ming was exhausted and sweating.

"Xiao Ye, your Heaven and Earth Society really isn't easy." Yan Ming felt deeply.

"Actually much better now. After all, we have some foundation. This past year, we haven't broken faith with the people."

"I say we should put effort into intensive collective farms." Yan Ming looked at his pile of freshly fingerprinted loan documents. "So complicated. Just force all these farmers and landlords into bankruptcy, then hire them as farm laborers."

"You're ruthless! But we still suffer from too few people. The Agricultural Committee started this Society plan precisely to cultivate a batch of private intensive farms to handle agricultural production, so we don't have to do everything personally—we just need to control the superstructure."

"I see!" Yan Ming nodded. "I'm beginning to understand the Executive Committee's thinking."

Fu Buer returned from training extremely excited. At training, he'd not only learned many new farming methods but toured the farm—rarely accessible to indigenous people—in short, eye-opening.

Only his wife brought more trouble. The several hundred *jin* of grain spent on farm tools earned him over an hour of tongue-lashing. Enraged, Fu Buer beat his wife soundly, then ignored her. He ordered household tools organized, oxen washed and fed grain, preparing for the agricultural technician's arrival to begin serious work.

His daily anticipation finally brought his longed-for high-yield seeds and technician. When a young Shorn One appeared alone at the village entrance carrying a large pack, all Meiyang Village was in uproar—Shorn Bandits had never come to Meiyang Village! Young women were called home. Fu Buer's elder, the village's richest man Fu Yousan, simply pretended illness and hid.

This young Shorn One didn't know he'd caused such commotion. Cursing, he extracted mud-caked feet from field-ridge paths. His Liberation shoes had become two large mud balls. He wore standard "Australian clothes": green front-buttoned jacket, colonial-style rattan bamboo pith helmet with rear neck flap. This was Wan Lihui.

Wan Lihui's beautiful dream of becoming Governor of Japan hadn't materialized—not only no governorship, but no freely playing with guns either. He'd been issued one pistol for self-defense with only six bullets. The farm had SKS-D semi-automatic rifles, but aside from monthly military training's five-round allowance, he couldn't touch them.

Wan Lihui and his recruited brother Wan Lihuang worked as stockmen on the farm, tending animals daily. Plus composting and processing rotting fruit continuously arriving from everywhere as earthworm feed. One or two boats of jackfruit arrived daily from Leizhou—this fruit was everywhere in Xuwen. Ancient distribution was poor; vast quantities couldn't be shipped out, rotting in fields. Leizhou Sugar Company dispatched people to buy cheaply, shipping boatload after boatload to Lingao.

This dripping, rotting, foul-smelling stuff arrived by the basket at the farm for the brothers to process. Handling this daily, despite masks, Wan Lihui smelled that sickly-sweet stench everywhere he went, losing his appetite.

Hearing the Society was assigning him as circuit agricultural technician for countryside tours, Wan Lihui nearly cried with joy—finally no more composting and earthworm-raising!

"Brother, the livestock farm is in your hands now." Wan Lihui solemnly told his masked, strongly-odorous brother. "This concerns new agriculture's great cause. You must do well, bring honor to the Wan family! Future Japanese Governor-General's Secretary General will be your job!"

After these pompous words, Wan Lihui quickly escaped.

The Society's agricultural circuit tours used rotation—each technician covered five or six villages, staying several days in each, cycling continuously through the production season, ensuring timely problem discovery and resolution.

Wan Lihui received his field kit, configured per Field Exploration Department recommendations. For water-safety issues, his luggage included pharmaceutical factory's self-produced water-purification tablets and packets of bleaching powder. The Health Department had given circuit technicians basic medical-hygiene training, equipping them with medicine kits containing basic drugs—including several well-received Chinese patent medicines recently produced by Runshitang.

"You agricultural technicians are not only modern agricultural technology's instructors, modern science's sowers, but also our transmigration enterprise's propagandists! Every second outside the Green Zone requires this awareness!"

Ma Qianzhu spoke thus at the farewell banquet for circuit technicians. The technicians felt uncomfortable—this really was too much responsibility!

Circuit technicians' villages were mostly within 40 kilometers of Bairren—the Blue Zone. After continuous suppression and routine patrol establishment, this area had become quite safe. Internal Affairs Committee believed solo technician visits posed no security problems, requiring no soldier escorts. Thus Wan Lihui came alone to Meiyang Village. Patrols delivered him five kilometers from the village, pointed the direction, and let him proceed alone.

Those mere five kilometers took him two and a half hours. Rainy-season field paths weren't just muddy but extremely sticky—every step required great effort to pull free. Wan Lihui had always prided himself as a true farmer's son, but 17th-century Lingao countryside conditions still shocked him. This unremarkable footpath alone showed how vast the several-century gap was.

Wan Lihui despairingly watched his feet sunk in yellow mud. His boots constantly threatened to separate from his feet—losing combat boots was an irreplaceable serious loss! Wan Lihui pulled hard, then simply removed shoes and socks. He tied shoes together by laces and hung them around his neck.

Walking barefoot on mud paths was indeed much more comfortable. Wan Lihui had never walked barefoot. In modern time-space, even in countryside, ground was always littered with glass shards and rusty metal scraps.

Wan Lihui entered Meiyang Village looking like this.

Fu Buer's Meiyang Village was one of many small villages scattered along Wenlan River, situated on a small hillock. The small village was surrounded by thorny bushes as defense against bandits, with a small river encircling it—even a simple drawbridge. Since recent security improvements, the strongmen previously guarding the bridgehead had been withdrawn. Only women remained at the river landing washing clothes and rice.

Now the women had also vanished. Only Fu Buer stood at the bridgehead with his household servants, welcoming this "Chief." Fu Buer was not only a Society customer but the village's "liaison"—transmigrator countryside visits to Meiyang Village were his responsibility to host. Women and curious children stood watching in the distance, ignoring family warnings, observing and discussing his clothes and appearance.

Wan Lihui heard the laughter and comments occasionally emanating from the women's group. His face reddened involuntarily. This made the women chatter even more enthusiastically.

Wan Lihui exchanged pleasantries with Fu Buer, then followed him home. Most village houses had bamboo-slat walls and straw roofs—poor people's dwellings. Several prosperous households were visible. Village layout was casual; with only thirty-odd households and small population, it wasn't crowded. Dirty water and garbage covered the ground; pigs and chickens wandered leisurely in the mud, occasionally rooting through garbage for food.

"This environment!" Wan Lihui thought, recalling all his vaccinations and the medicines he'd brought.

"This is it." Fu Buer led him to a compound's main gate. Fu Buer's household was among the village's better-off. Inside was a large courtyard; center stood a three-room brick-and-tile main building, flanked by wing buildings—all residential. A side courtyard housed livestock, stored tools, and lodged hired hands.

Fu Buer had cleaned out one wing room for Wan Lihui's accommodation. Wan Lihui judged the overall environment reasonably clean and decided to stay.

Just after opening his large backpack, he heard a woman in the main building rapid-firing Lingao dialect—rising and falling shouts—then pig-slaughter-like screams and wailing. Wan Lihui was momentarily confused.

"The master is beating his wife." The speaker was Fu Buer's household servant girl, called Fu Xi—a teenage girl of thirteen or fourteen, dressed somewhat raggedly but very neatly, with two black braids. She carried a teapot in. Seeing Wan Lihui, she first curtsied.

"You speak Mandarin?" Wan Lihui was surprised. Fu Xi's Mandarin wasn't standard but at least communicable—better than his Lingao dialect that even locals might not understand.

"A little. I attend Fangcaodi."

"School? You're a Citizen Academy student then."

"Yes, the master sent me to study." Fu Xi helped organize his luggage while talking. "Master said you were coming, and the household needed someone who understands Mandarin, so he called me back."

"Oh, will you return to school after I leave?"

"Of course. The Citizen Academy is much more interesting than here—better food, not dirty." The girl pursed her lips. "Only our household is somewhat clean in this village. Master became cleanliness-obsessed after returning from the prisoner camp last year."

"Your master is quite enlightened, willing to send a girl to school." Wan Lihui said.

"He just didn't want to lose Fu Qing and Fu Xiang's labor. So he sent me to learn reading, abacus, and bookkeeping. Also wanted me to learn spinning or something."

Fu Buer's household had four total house servants; besides these three, there was one called Fu Fu, somewhat older. He'd been sent to serve the transmigrators during the spring conscription.

"Apparently he's serving in the Security Corps." Fu Xi said. "Once enlisted, hearts grow wild. Master was counting on his military salary, but didn't get a single coin—made him curse up a storm." She giggled at this, apparently finding it satisfying.
