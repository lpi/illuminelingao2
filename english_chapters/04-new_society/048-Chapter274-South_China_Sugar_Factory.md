# Chapter 274: South China Sugar Factory

"It should be real. Many sugar industry books say so." Wen Tong was also quite nervous. Never mind himself—even the elders in his family who had worked in the sugar industry their whole lives had only ever worked in modern factories and never seen this traditional method.

Yet the effect that followed was indeed like magic. After pouring the yellow clay water and waiting a moment, they looked at the sugar in the *wa liu* molds—it had indeed turned snow-white. Of course, this "snow-white" was relative. Compared to the refined white sugar from modern times, its color was still slightly dull and yellowish. It didn't quite reach the "exceptionally pure" level described in the books.

The top layer of the *wa liu* held the whitest sugar, while the bottom had a slight yellow-brown tint. Both could be considered white sugar, though the former commanded a higher price.

Wen Tong shook his head. He knew very well why the sugar treated with yellow clay water wasn't especially white: the sugar liquid hadn't gone through a centrifuge, so there was still a lot of molasses residue. He wondered if the Machinery Department could manufacture a centrifuge.

The output efficiency of this process wasn't high either. The sugar in the *wa liu* was stratified—the whitest at the top, getting darker toward the bottom. The sugar at the very bottom was quite dark. He weighed it: of the ten kilograms of sugar from one *wa liu*, only about sixty percent could be considered "white sugar." The rest was yellow or brown sugar. The process was cumbersome and the yield rate low. In ancient times, such a process could still turn a profit, but once modern sugar enterprises appeared, rustic sugar mills went bankrupt one after another due to cost factors.

What they'd produced so far was only large, irregularly-shaped chunks of sugar. To truly make fine powdered white sugar like "sugar frost," they needed an additional "recrystallization" step. The white sugar had to be melted again and slowly boiled over low heat. Fine sugar powder would gradually crystallize on the surface of the pot. It had to be scraped off promptly with a bamboo scraper to prevent scorching and discoloration. This process was similar to boiling salt. In factories, specialized evaporation-crystallization tanks were used. Wen Tong had to experiment himself. Chang Shide helped tend the fire, assisted by Wen Xiu and Wen Qing. To avoid disrupting the normal production of the sugar mill, Wen Tong had a small sugar shed constructed on the estate to serve as a sugar-making laboratory. The four of them crowded into this temporary structure, surrounded by smoke and flames. Wen Tong checked the heat one moment and watched the pot the next, growing so dizzy he nearly fell into the boiling sugar.

Reality proved that a person strong in theory might not excel in practice, especially in such primitive, crude conditions. With a furnace burning sugarcane leaves and bagasse, the heat was simply not something that could be controlled by someone accustomed to adjusting a gas stove with the turn of a knob. After one fuel addition, the flames surged, and the sugar on the pot's surface immediately scorched.

"This won't do. There's no way to control the temperature in this furnace. The heat is too difficult to regulate," Wen Tong said dejectedly. In rustic sugar mills, the stoker's wages were second only to the sugar-boiling master's. He wasn't being paid for nothing.

To regulate the heat uniformly, they couldn't use such a firewood stove. They needed fuel that burned steadily and released heat evenly—various gas fuels, charcoal, or coal briquettes could all achieve this. Or, like in factories, they could use steam heating. But none of these were available in Xuwen.

Wen Tong racked his brain for half a day and finally thought of the water bath method. By heating the vessel containing the white sugar liquid indirectly through a water bath, the temperature became even, eliminating the problem of scorching. After several days of experimentation, he finally harvested his first batch of five kilograms of fine white sugar.

With white sugar, making rock candy was a simple matter. The traditional rock candy process required melting white sugar and adding chicken or duck egg whites as a clarifying agent. Wen Tong felt this was too costly. The so-called egg whites were just protein, after all. He decided to use soy milk as a substitute. Wen Tong simply had a mill built on the estate and instructed a migrant who had previously made tofu to produce it daily, meeting the workers' needs while keeping soy milk readily available.

After clarifying with soy milk, freshly cut bamboo was split into strips of various sizes and placed in the sugar liquid. The liquid would crystallize around the bamboo strips, slowly forming large pieces of rock candy. When harvesting, they only had to break the rock candy and pull out the bamboo. This method had been in use since the Song Dynasty.

"The look is quite nice—" This rock candy, though not as pure as the single-crystal rock candy of later generations, was decent enough. Selling it should make it a hot commodity.

The next step was to scale up white sugar production. Wen Tong had people order the water bath vessels. Meanwhile, he hired craftsmen to build a new workshop by the river specifically for refining white sugar. To ensure cleanliness and quality, high standards were implemented in the construction.

The white sugar workshop was built according to modern factory specifications. Though wooden beams and columns were used, the entire building was brick and tile, with no thatch or sugarcane leaves covering the roof. The windows were large for good lighting—to avoid attracting too much attention, they were covered with paper rather than the planned glass. The workshop floor was paved with square bricks and had covered drainage ditches with grates for easy cleaning. Fifteen sugar-boiling stations were arranged in a row, which was space-saving and convenient for operation. The fire-stoking and ventilation openings were all set outside under a covered veranda—this allowed operation during rain and prevented the indoor air and floors from being polluted by ash.

All the equipment was newly made. Wen Tong also had several wells dug by the river to avoid using the polluted river water directly. He spent lavishly to build a warehouse entirely of brick and tile, specifically for storing sugar products. In addition to white and brown sugar, there were vast quantities of molasses. Liao Dahua had many large vats custom-made at a local pottery workshop specifically to store this stuff—though he had no idea what Shopkeeper Wen planned to do with such sludge.

The workers in the new sugar factory were all selected from among the migrants. Wen Tong personally trained them in all the operational procedures and established a complete set of production rules and regulations.

"Wen Qing!" Wen Tong said. "From now on, all management of the South China Sugar Factory is entirely your responsibility!"

In truth, both Wen Tong and Chang Shide were worried about entrusting such work to a servant. But they had no choice. Apart from these two servant boys, very few of the migrants were literate.

"Yes, Master! Thank you for your trust!" Wen Qing gave a deep bow. "This humble one will do my utmost!"

"I have a complete set of production rules and procedures here. You must supervise them to carry everything out exactly according to the system. No private modifications are allowed. If the workers have any ideas, you can relay them to me, and I'll consider them."

"Yes, Master!"

"Even if I walk into the workshop and see a single grain of sugar on the floor, I'll hold you accountable!" Wen Tong assumed the posture of a stern master.

Wen Qing looked at him uneasily. How had this usually affable master suddenly become so severe?

"Yes, this humble one understands. I won't break a single rule."

"Go on then. Take your workers and learn the regulations. Everyone must have them memorized within three days. Anyone who can't recite them won't get meat serves on the weekend."

"Then they'll memorize them even if it kills them." Wen Qing laughed.

"Hmph." Wen Tong finally cracked a smile. Of the two servant boys, he preferred Wen Qing. Though he was a bit slower in anticipating his master's needs, he seemed more reliable. "You need to study hard yourself, too. Have you been reading the book I gave you?"

The book was a *Training Manual for Indigenous Industrial and Commercial Management Cadres*, jointly compiled by Wu De's Civil Affairs Committee and the Intelligence and Archives Committee. It was based on several months of accumulated experience, combined with ancient and modern management systems. It covered basic management models, workload calculations, wage and benefit formulas, accident protocols, and more. Like the *Handbook for Civil Affairs Administration and Organization*, it was part of the *Indigenous Work Series*, currently still in the "Draft for Comment" stage.

"This humble one studies it hard every night. There are some parts I don't understand—I'll need to ask the Master for instruction."

"Anything you don't understand, you can come ask at any time in the evening," Wen Tong said earnestly. "You're a servant by birth. Though you know a few characters, the workers won't readily obey you. Only by having real skills will you command authority. You can't rely solely on your master's power to suppress them."

"Yes! This humble one thanks the Master for his teaching."

After sending Wen Qing off, Wen Xiu came over with a tea tray.

"Master has worked hard. Please have some tea." After learning that neither of these shopkeepers was interested in "the Southern Wind," and seeing that the honest Wen Qing had recently been favored, Wen Xiu knew he had to change his approach. He put away the coquettish manner that used to slip out constantly and appeared much more dignified.

"Mm. Where is Master Chang?"

"He went to Hai'an Street."

Hai'an Street was Leizhou's sugar export port. Though not a county seat, it was more prosperous than the county capital, Haikang. There were over thirty sugar trading houses on the street alone. The first time Wen Tong visited, he was truly impressed by its grandeur—after seeing enough poverty and desolation in Lingao, arriving at such a flourishing Ming commercial center was a shock no less intense than a Lingao villager visiting East Gate Market.

Wen Tong was somewhat surprised. Though Hai'an Street was only about ten kilometers away, they usually informed each other before going far. Had he snuck off to find women? Wen Tong immediately realized: Hai'an Street, with its gathering of merchants and thriving markets, was always a prime location for brothels.

"So he *did* go hunting for wild game!" Wen Tong gnashed his teeth. *Old Chang, you're holding out on me. You could at least have told me so we could go have fun together.* Now Chang had gone off with Liao Dahua, and Wen Tong didn't dare wander off alone. He could only fume silently and go teach the worker training class: three hundred basic simplified characters, simple math, and statistics. Once the sugar factory's scale expanded, these workers could be promoted to management.

While Wen Tong was grinding his teeth in frustration, Chang Shide was strolling through Hai'an Street accompanied by Liao Dahua. Their destination: the human market.

Chang Shide had originally planned to go straight to a brothel. As for the threat of sexually transmitted diseases, he was prepared—he'd stuffed several boxes of condoms in his luggage. But after being introduced by Liao Dahua to several so-called high-end brothels, he became reluctant. These establishments had decent facilities and the women were passable even by modern standards, but there were too many pretentious rituals—first hosting tea, then listening to music and drinking wine. Even after all this, they couldn't get down to business immediately. They had to come back two or three times before they could get near the bed. This was way too much trouble. Even "high-end clubs" in modern times didn't have procedures this complicated.

What Chang Shide didn't know was that high-end brothels in this era also served a social function. Dignitaries, gentlemen, and wealthy merchants came here primarily for socializing and cultural fulfillment. The higher class the courtesan, the more she sat and discussed philosophy rather than performing bedroom techniques.

Seeing that the Master didn't seem interested in this, Liao Dahua guessed his thoughts. These sea merchants, having drifted on the ocean for so long, naturally had no patience for foreplay. So he led him toward the back alleys—where there were more practical "private establishments."

However, after observing the makeup of the women soliciting customers at the doors and catching the smell drifting from a distance, Chang Shide concluded that if he wanted women in this world, it was best to raise them himself. Though Liao Dahua specifically recommended several places where the women were supposedly particularly skilled, Chang Shide declined.

Liao Dahua figured these women didn't meet the Master's standards. Thinking that Australians all seemed to have a hygiene obsession and probably found prostitutes unclean, he led him to the human market.

The so-called human market was just an open lot. A few traders sat in nearby thatched sheds drinking tea and chatting. These were the ones selling higher-end merchandise. If anyone showed interest, they would take the customer to a nearby room to look at the goods—mostly young women, though there were also boys. The prices were substantial. Outside, some people were selling themselves, with grass tags stuck in their hair, at low prices.

Chang Shide walked around, looking at the traders' stock and the self-sellers. None suited him. The traders' merchandise was clean and presentable, but the asking prices were exorbitant. Even eleven- or twelve-year-old girls cost fifty taels. Chang Shide had no interest in raising little girls, nor in little girls themselves. Besides, he didn't have that much silver—though he'd accumulated tens of thousands of work points.

Seeing the displeasure on Master Chang's face, Liao Dahua followed silently, unable to gauge his thoughts.

After another circuit, a new stall suddenly caught their eye. Several runners from the *yamen* stood there, guarding five or six women of various ages sitting or kneeling on the ground. The oldest was over thirty, the youngest only twelve or thirteen. Though disheveled and dirty, their nutritional condition looked fairly good. Strangely, no one was approaching to inquire. Chang instructed Liao Dahua to investigate.
