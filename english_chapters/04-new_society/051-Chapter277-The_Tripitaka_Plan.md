# Chapter 277: The Tripitaka Plan

Speaking of intelligence gathering, the network the Guangzhou Station had laid in Leizhou could already collect most of the information—there was no concept of confidentiality here. Given enough time, nearly anything could be found out. Why had the Executive Committee sent Bei Wei, and also this mysterious Chen Tianxiong? Were they really going to occupy Leizhou?

Putting his doubts aside, Chang Shide was in no position to ask directly. With people from "the center" present, he couldn't exactly call the women to his room these past few days. For Chang Shide, who had gotten used to nights of revelry, the abstinence was proving rather difficult to endure.

That evening, Bei Wei joined Chen Tianxiong, who had been staying out of sight with his team in the compound.

"We've indeed come to Leizhou with a mission," Chen Tianxiong said, getting straight to the point.

Chang Shide and Wen Tong both nodded. Wen Tong stood up, went out to check the courtyard, and said to Zhou Shizhai, who was resting with eyes closed under the veranda:

"Keep watch. Don't let anyone come over."

Zhou Shizhai gave a slight nod. Wen Tong returned to the room.

"Go ahead. What's this about?"

"This plan is still in the evaluation phase. Bei Wei and I are actually both here for the same task: to conduct on-site reconnaissance of the plan's feasibility and gather operational intelligence. As for the content of the plan, I can tell you—" He paused. "The plan is codenamed 'Project Tripitaka'."

Project Tripitaka?! Wen Tong and Chang Shide were both stunned. Was this some kind of joke?

Seeing their expressions, Chen Tianxiong explained: "Do you remember the first tribulation in the story of Tripitaka's origins?"

"The story of Jiang Liu'er—" Of course they'd all read *Journey to the West*, and they racked their brains to recall the plot around Tripitaka's birth.

Chang Shide's face changed color: "You mean we're going to become river pirates?!"

"That's right." Chen Tianxiong nodded.

A member of the Intelligence and Archives Committee, while compiling *Historical Reference Materials*, had happened to notice a story in the *Leizhou Gazetteer*.

During the Chongzhen reign, an official who had been appointed to serve as Prefect of Leizhou was traveling to take up his post with his family when he encountered a band of mountain bandits. The official and his family were killed. What made the story remarkable was that the bandits' leader, using the official's credentials, actually came to Leizhou and took over from the previous prefect, duly serving as a proper official.

This bandit served as an official in Leizhou for two full years—and with a good reputation, at that. It wasn't until the real official's son came to Leizhou seeking refuge and discovered the bandit's identity, then reported it to the local Brokerade Guard, that the truth came out. The *Jinyiwei* arranged a banquet and lured the bandit to an ambush site, where he was captured. The bandit confessed to the entire affair.

This "curious tale" unearthed from old documents sparked limitless imagination in the intelligence departments. The *Leizhou Gazetteer* was a local historical record; its reliability as a source was quite high.

What if the person who took over the post wasn't a bandit, but a member of the transmigrators?

This idea was so fantastic and bold that it met with opposition from many in the General Office and Intelligence Committee as soon as it was proposed. But supporters raised the most powerful argument: if an ordinary bandit could occupy the position of Leizhou Prefect for so long and earn a good reputation, a transmigrator from the 21st century should be able to do the same. Not to mention that the transmigrator would have the entire Transmigration Collective as backing.

The objection raised by opponents was that a Ming Dynasty bandit could impersonate a prefect only because he exploited the information asymmetry of that era. Whatever the case, a bandit was still a person of that time. His understanding of all aspects of Ming society was far deeper than that of 21st-century visitors. Sending someone from a completely different era to impersonate an official was pure fantasy.

"Our people, when standing among the indigenous population, display differences that are just too obvious!" Ran Yao strongly opposed. "If you asked me to impersonate some county-level city mayor or party secretary in the 21st century, I might have a chance. After all, I've never eaten pork, but I've seen pigs run. But now you're asking us to find a white Anglo-Saxon to serve as a city leader. Is that possible? And the gap between us and Ming Dynasty people is even greater than the difference between modern Americans and Chinese!"

His argument was sound, but the potential benefits were simply too attractive—the entire Leizhou Prefecture would effectively fall under the transmigrators' control. Although there were officials at various levels under the Leizhou Prefect, the transmigrators had no doubt that under the combined pressure of economic and military soft and hard power, all of them would submit. Ultimately, they could create a "Red inside, White outside" style local government.

Minor benefits like facilitating commercial infiltration by the Transmigration regime were one thing, but the key was that they could legitimately enter the Great Ming's bureaucratic system, participate in its operations, and obtain government information directly. This would be far more timely and reliable than the Guangzhou Station's method of bribing *yamen* clerks to pass on messages. Controlling Leizhou would effectively add a buffer zone for Qiongzhou. If someday the Great Ming decided to mount a military campaign against Lingao, Leizhou, right across the strait, would inevitably be a major transit area for troops. Whether for intelligence gathering or harassment operations, they would have a reliable base.

"If taking over one official position brings such huge benefits, why don't we just assassinate the Prefect of Guangzhou directly, then replace the incoming official on the road?" Someone raised this challenge.

"Because the mountain bandit in Leizhou actually succeeded in history, whereas an attempt to replace the Prefect of Guangzhou never happened. Right now, we only need to replace the bandit, just as we're preparing to replace the Manchus," Chen Tianxiong, who warmly supported this plan, said.

So after several internal discussions, the proposal was submitted to an enlarged meeting of the Executive Committee for discussion.

"I object. This is a critical period for the development of our government. The knowledge possessed by every transmigrator is extremely precious. I oppose doing something this dangerous!" Wu Nanhai firmly objected.

"So we're not going to do anything revolutionary because we're afraid of dying?" Xi Yazhou, who had been "recuperating from illness" for many days, reappeared at the meeting. Only his waistline had expanded—the somewhat lean and capable look he'd developed over the past year had reverted to his military-otaku appearance. "I firmly support this proposal. It will be of great help for future development."

"Send a relatively loyal indigenous person to do it. With how we speak, and our poor handwriting, impersonating a Ming Dynasty prefect would be way too hard." Xiao Zishan offered a cautious opinion.

"Do you think the bandit's handwriting was any good? Maybe he was illiterate, and he still served as an official for two years and governed quite well."

"Who says bandits are uneducated? Maybe he was cultured but had fallen on hard times."

"Or maybe he was one of our predecessors... Unfortunately, cut down before achieving his ambitions..."

"Attention, please don't go off topic." Ma Qianzhu, who was chairing the meeting, was deeply disgusted by the habit of "derailing threads" at every meeting.

"On this point, I agree with Commissioner Xiao," Wu De said. "It's not just about speech and handwriting. In many lifestyle habits and mannerisms, we're completely out of sync with the indigenous population. We might fool ordinary people—at most they'd think us eccentric. But what's truly dangerous is encountering colleagues, subordinates, superiors, and gentry. Those people wouldn't be so easy to hoodwink."

"I think we should select a relatively loyal indigenous person to do it," someone suggested. "Like Zhang Xingjiao, for example. He's educated, can speak Mandarin, and should be suitable."

"Comrade, revolution is not a dinner party. This task, though dangerous, is extremely critical. If we don't send one of our own to take charge and rely only on a few recruited indigenous people, can you guarantee reliability? Zhang Xingjiao is reliable now, but what if he gets a taste for being an official and decides to trade our heads for a real position?" Xi Yazhou retorted bluntly.

"Then we don't necessarily have to have a transmigrator be the prefect. We can use a puppet and control things from behind the scenes," Wu Nanhai said.

"That's even less secure. Don't forget, we're sending someone to infiltrate the court. The most important thing is the position itself. With a puppet, how would it be any different from just collecting information from among the common people?" Wei Aiwen said dismissively. "What can you expect from a civil official? So afraid of dying."

"How can you say that? Without us administrative personnel, where would your Army get its weapons and food?" Wu Nanhai jumped up like his tail had been stepped on, pointing at him.

"And what about the Army providing you free labor every day? It's all unpaid!" Wei Aiwen clearly intended to settle accounts with the Agriculture Department.

"Without our military protection, it would be questionable whether the Transmigration Collective could even survive," Le Lin, the representative for the naval meeting, fired off a remark. The naval firebrand Li Haiping and most of the senior officers had gone to sea, so this role fell to the Hong Kong military enthusiast who dressed like a movie star. Though the navy and army's young hotheads were at odds over competition for resources and manpower, they were even more at odds with the administrative personnel who controlled the Transmigration government's economic purse strings.

"Alright, everyone calm down." Facing the potential outbreak of civil-military conflict, Director Wen intervened in time: "The Leizhou Prefect position is very important to us. My view is that we should try to take it if possible. As for whether this Leizhou Prefect should be a transmigrator or an indigenous person, we can discuss that later. Let's vote first on whether to execute this proposal. All in favor, raise your hands." He raised his own hand first.

The resolution passed by an overwhelming majority.

"Alright, actually there's one issue we've overlooked," Wen Desi said slowly. "What year does this happen? Chongzhen reigned for seventeen years, after all."

"According to the *Leizhou Gazetteer*, it was in the year 1632."

"So that means there are still three years," Wen Desi said. "Three years is enough time to do a lot. The first thing we should do now is send people to Leizhou to conduct on-site reconnaissance of the terrain and social environment, and evaluate the difficulty of this plan."

"That's right with those who are so enthusiastic about this—let me remind everyone that executing this will be extremely difficult." Ran Yao reminded them. "What's this incoming official's name? Where's he from? What route is he taking? What date does he enter Leizhou's territory? None of this is written in the book."

"Need you ask? He's definitely sitting in a sedan chair, with people in front holding signs like 'Silence' and 'Make Way'..."

"Stop joking around. The man hasn't even taken office yet," Yu Eshui said. "Ran Yao is right. Without clarifying these details, how can you expect the Special Reconnaissance Team to intercept him? And there's another thing—we have to act before the bandit does. I think finding this bandit is much harder than finding the official."

Xiao Zishan said: "True. An official taking up a post at least leaves a trail. This nameless bandit—we don't know where he's holed up. Leizhou is so big. It's like looking for a needle in a haystack."

"That's not a major problem—" Xi Yazhou said. "The key is still the official. If we can find him, we can find the bandit. Even if the bandit acts first, it doesn't matter. As long as he hasn't received his seal of office, we can still take him out on the road. From that perspective, neither the bandit nor the official really matters. What's important is getting the official's luggage and credentials."

Once the plan was decided, the Executive Committee authorized the Intelligence Committee to formulate "Project Tripitaka." The plan had two parts. One part was recruiting future infiltrators from among the transmigrators. The recruitment prerequisite was that losing this person wouldn't affect the Transmigration Collective's enterprise. And they had to be volunteers. After recruitment, they would receive Intelligence Committee training to quickly master Ming Dynasty customs and learn official Mandarin—while practicing their calligraphy. At the same time, the Civil Affairs Committee received instructions to search among the population under the Transmigration regime's control for potential minor intellectuals who could be selected, given preferential treatment and indoctrination, to serve as backup personnel.

The other part was large-scale intelligence gathering in Leizhou to prepare for and evaluate Project Tripitaka. Considering that the South China Sugar Factory was actually a factory and wasn't very convenient as an intelligence-gathering point, the Executive Committee decided to use them only as a support unit. Chen Tianxiong was dispatched to Leizhou as a dedicated intelligence operative, to fully utilize the network the Guangzhou Station had laid in Leizhou for intelligence gathering.

After hearing Chen Tianxiong's briefing, Wen Tong and Chang Shide finally understood. Chang Shide said excitedly: "This is really thrilling! Replace everyone from top to bottom, hahaha... Better yet, let's replace the Xuwen County Magistrate too!"

"The idea is nice, but the Leizhou Prefect is in Haikang County. The prefectural and county governments share the same city. This fake prefect probably won't be easy to impersonate, right?" Wen Tong expressed concern.

"That's why Bei Wei is here," Chen Tianxiong said.

"This trip is a reconnaissance journey for Project Tripitaka." Bei Wei nodded. "To thoroughly survey the terrain, landscape, and urban environment of the entire Leizhou Prefecture, so we know it by heart."

"Good. Whatever you need, just ask. We'll do everything in our power to support the intelligence work."

"Find me reliable guides," Bei Wei said. "People who know the local situation well."

"Sure. Liao Dahua, the Qiwei branch manager, is good. He knows the upper and lower social strata well. But he doesn't know martial arts..."

"That's fine. We're here to reconnoiter. We plan to disguise ourselves as small peddlers and wander around looking."
