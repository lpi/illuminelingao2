# Chapter 449 Abuses

"However, the Capital Warehouse Official Rice doesn't all need to be shipped to the capital," Wang Zhaomin explained. Originally during the Hongwu reign, autumn grain really had to be transported thousands of *li* to the capital. The "Grain Chiefs" in the *Lijia* system were responsible for grain transport. The manpower and material resources consumed were obvious. Grain Chiefs often went bankrupt because of this burden.

Later, considering local needs and reducing losses from round-trip transport, regulations changed so that part of the money and grain was shipped to the capital, part was directly transferred to where money and grain were needed in the prefecture, and part was kept in Qiongzhou Prefecture granaries for reserve, only entered into the Board of Revenue's accounts.

"That is indeed much more convenient." Wu De nodded. If sent to Qiongzhou Prefecture, whether by land or sea, the distance was very short. Even at Ming dynasty levels, it shouldn't be too difficult.

"Where is there such a good thing!" Wang Zhaomin shook his head. Having served as a private secretary for over a decade, he had never seen grain collection and payment in a county be an easy matter. He couldn't help but deliberately show off to display his skills—somehow, Wang Zhaomin now viewed the Australians' opinion of him as increasingly important.

"Just within the quota of this Capital Warehouse Official Rice to be shipped to Qiongzhou, one thousand five hundred seventy-nine *shi* one *sheng* nine *he* is transferred to Changhua as provisions, and two thousand one hundred eighty-one *shi* nine *dou* two *sheng* five *he* is turned over for Prefecture official and troop provisions. So the county has to transport grain to five places: Qiongzhou Prefecture, Changhua County, Danzhou, Wanzhou, and Lingshui County. The expenses in shipping and acceptance tallying are uncountable." Wang Zhaomin pretended to worry about the country and people. "It disturbs the people extremely!"

*Still have to go to Changhua?* Wu De thought. *This is actually on the way. Since the round-island sailing and the construction of Changhua Fort and Yulin Fort, we've opened regular round-island shipping routes. Transporting grain to Changhua is a piece of cake.*

"Why also go to places like Danzhou and Wanzhou?"

"Because these places all have Prefecture Granaries."

The official granaries of Qiongzhou Prefecture were not all in the prefecture city. In the Ming dynasty, Qiongzhou Prefecture had five granaries. Four were established in outer counties, such as the Guangji Granary in Wanzhou and the Nanfeng Granary in Lingshui.

The dispersed grain storage locations were mostly in critical strategic areas, especially locations with danger of "Li unrest," facilitating nearby grain access for punitive expeditions once conflict arose.

The brown rice payable by each county had to be transported to these granaries for tallying. Wang Zhaomin said: Lingao had to hand over one thousand *shi* to Danzhou, one thousand two hundred *shi* to Wanzhou, and nine hundred *shi* to Lingshui. The provisions transported to Changhua for the Changhua Thousand Household Post were one thousand five hundred *shi*. Only the remainder was transported to the Qiongzhou Prefecture city.

"Transporting grain thousands of *li* is secondary; there are also various tricks during acceptance tallying at the granaries." Wang Zhaomin said. Whether it was a military granary or a prefecture granary, the managing officials were all "unranked" petty officials. But let alone such unranked petty officials, even the tallymen and head granary laborers inside, if not greased properly, would cause endless trouble during grain payment acceptance. Either picking fault with the rice quality or insisting the weight was insufficient. If the acceptance period passed, a penalty for missing the deadline was unavoidable.

"So that's how it is!" Wu De nodded. It seemed the Crossing Group undertaking the county tax was still a challenging job. Just grain transport and acceptance had such tricks; the tricks in other links could be imagined.

One thousand three hundred *shi* was kept in the county for officials' salaries and daily administrative expenses. From this, provisions for the county garrison troops—five hundred seventy-two *shi* and two *he*—and provisions for the Bopu Port Inspection Station—seventeen *shi* eight *dou* six *sheng*—had to be deducted. In reality, even for a small county like Lingao, this bit of grain kept in the county was completely insufficient for expenses. Besides maintaining basic administrative operations, the county basically couldn't do anything it wanted.

Wu De thought, *Undertaking grain tax seems to need a batch of natives familiar with local conditions to help. This Wang Zhaomin needs to be key target to win over.*

Thinking of this, he nodded: "Thank you, Mr. Wang, for teaching me."

"Not at all, not at all." After showing off, Wang Zhaomin saw this Australian big boss listening with rapt attention and a grave expression, and his spirits immediately lifted. "Just a bit of superficial views."

"Regarding this grain collection matter, we still need Private Secretary Wang to give more guidance." Wu De said. Seeing the night was deep and there was still much to talk about, he ordered supper to be prepared.

Originally, Wu De intended to win over Wang Zhaomin, so this supper wasn't made by Zhang Youfu's maidservants. The stove, utensils, condiments, and food were all provided by the Women's Cooperative Restaurant in East Gate Market. The two cooks were originally refugees from Guangdong with good skills; after training by the Crossing Group, their skills had improved further. Hearing it was a big boss banqueting a noble guest, they summoned one hundred and twenty percent of their spirit to cook delicious food.

The things made weren't rare in the modern space-time, just Cantonese morning tea dim sum. Lingao didn't lack seafood locally, and the Tianchu Sauce Garden provided various modern condiments, so the tea points made didn't differ much from modern space-time. But in this space-time, these things became extremely rare "delicacies."

Because of the lack of wheat flour, these "Cantonese Dim Sum" weren't sold publicly, used only for Transmigrators' own use and entertaining native noble guests. Wang Zhaomin naturally hadn't eaten them. Seeing the semi-transparent dumplings served wrapping red shrimp meat and emerald green peas, he was already somewhat stunned. Putting one in his mouth, Wang Zhaomin closed his eyes to savor it carefully, unable to speak for a long time.

Because it was a late-night snack, no wine was prepared, but the cigarettes and tea were top quality. After the meal, Wang Zhaomin smoked a cigarette, pondering for a long time before smiling: "I really can't understand you people!"

This was relatively deep talk, different from the polite remarks spoken all along. Wu De knew Private Secretary Wang's psychological defense line had loosened somewhat. He intentionally created a relaxed atmosphere precisely to talk deeply with Wang Zhaomin and see if there was a possibility of subduing him for their own use.

"How so?"

"With your food, clothing, and expenditure, Australia must be a good place with rich people and a wealthy state. Instead of staying well in your own hometown, you insisted on leaving your native land to come to this remote, poor backcountry of Lingao. What exactly is the reason?"

Wu De laughed dryly a few times. *I can't tell you right now it's to 'Unify the Six Directions and Gather the Eight Desolations'; you'd think I'm crazy. Even a smaller goal—entering the Central Plains—would scare you to death.* He could only say: "Not enough to tell outsiders."

Wang Zhaomin, however, thought: *Probably this group were dignitaries in Australia. Either they lost in domestic factional struggles or failed in palace infighting, so they had to lead their followers and kin to cross the sea and flee to the Great Ming. Seeing them build roads, construct houses, and dredge river ports, they verify have the intention to live here long-term.*

*If so, I could persuade them to write a memorial to show submission ('Internal Attachment'). With their intelligence and various exquisite Australian goods, if they campaign in the capital beforehand and then present it before the Emperor, the Court probably wouldn't refuse. If the Court allows them to settle in Lingao, it would solve an immediate trouble.*

"Having arrived in the Great Ming, does the Noble Group plan to stay in this corner of Lingao for a long time?"

"What high views does Private Secretary Wang have?"

Wang Zhaomin spoke his views. Wu De disapproved inwardly—this kind of amnesty/recruitment thing was out of the question right now. seeing him uninterested, Wang Zhaomin could only sigh and stop speaking.

Wu De, however, shouldn't chill his heart, so he said: "Private Secretary Wang, it's not that we don't know what's good for us. Although our learning is shallow, we still know 'A common man is innocent, but complying treasures is a crime.'"

Wang Zhaomin was startled, knowing what he said made sense. With the things the Australians possessed, if the Court knew, not to mention the Emperor, wouldn't the officials high and low view them as a big piece of fat meat? The various difficulties, exploitations, and extortions then could be imagined.

"Yes, yes, the Noble Group's worry is correct."

They stopped discussing this issue and continued talking about details of grain collection. Wang Zhaomin's main purpose this time was to discuss "Private Fees," which was the customary benefit the Magistrate had in the grain collection process.

This benefit wasn't only for the Magistrate; the Assistant Magistrate, Jail Warden, and other auxiliary officials in the county all had to moisten their lips a bit, but the bulk was for the Magistrate. As for Private Secretary Wang, there was also a benefit, customarily around one hundred taels of silver.

In the past, although there were Tax Farmers, they didn't monopolize everything. It had to be aggregated at the county, and Wang Zhaomin customarily presided over how to distribute the shares. Now since the Australians monopolized it, this fee had to be made clear beforehand.

This benefit naturally came from "Floating Collection." According to Wang Zhaomin, Lingao's customary Floating Collection was an additional 3 *dou* to 3 *dou* 5 *sheng* per *shi* of the principal quota, depending on the harvest year.

Within this Floating Collection, 1 *dou* was "Private Fees," the benefit for county officials, normally around 800 to 1000 *shi*.

Wu De nodded. This figure was quite different from the numbers obtained by the Social Investigation Team; it seemed lower. He would have to tell the Social Investigation Team to conduct another focused sample survey later.

"Although the customary wastage rice is 3 *dou* per *shi* of principal quota, in reality, bitterness and joy are uneven." Wang Zhaomin reminded. "Some grain households don't pay even one *he* of wastage rice, while some have to pay seven or eight *dou*. To pay or not, to pay more or less—these tricks are all in the clerk's hands. His benefits are also found here."

"I accept the matter of Private Fees." Wu De agreed on the spot. "When grain collection ends, it will be presented together." Saying this, he got up and went to the next room. His accompanying guard took an envelope and returned to the room, handing it to Wang Zhaomin with both hands.

"What is this?" Wang Zhaomin feigned surprise.

"A Letter of Appointment." Wu De said extremely sincerely. "We have just arrived and are people from overseas, knowing nothing about these tricks. Since we are appreciated by the county to undertake the tax monopoly this time, we still need Private Secretary Wang to guide and support us more. This is the Letter of Appointment for an 'Advisor'."

"No need, no need, where is the need." Wang Zhaomin declined very politely, thinking *how can I casually accept this thing? Wouldn't it become evidence of accepting a 'puppet office' later?*

But seeing Wu De insistent on giving it, fearing refusal would anger the other party, he had to accept it first, thinking he would just burn it upon return.
