# Chapter 250: Launching

Bopu Harbor, colorful flags fluttering.

On the temporarily erected shipyard viewing platform, the high officials of the Transmigration Regime were all dressed in bright clothes: all the committee members had changed into the more presentable clothes found in their luggage. Although they still looked bizarre to the common people, at least they were more colorful and had better fabrics than the clothes they usually wore.

Regarding the issue of official uniforms for transmigrators, some bored individuals had already issued a proposal on the internal BBS a few days ago. Currently, it was entering the preliminary discussion stage. According to Wen Desi's experience, this kind of discussion would not have a result for two or three weeks.

"Ship Zero" stood silently in the dry dock. The scaffolding on all sides had been removed, and the hull construction was fully completed, leaving only deck facilities like masts and sails uninstalled. The dock's steam engine was driving the water pump to fill the dock with water. As the chief designer of the ship, Wen Desi harbored mixed feelings about actually being able to guide the construction of a real seagoing vessel: he was both proud and uneasy.

Fortunately, Zhang Jiqi, the boatwright, was there. Wen Desi glanced at Zhang Jiqi, who couldn't stop smiling. As the shipyard's Master Shipwright, he sat side by side with the head of the Lin clan on the viewing platform. Compared to the latter, he could simply be said to be riding the crest of success—the successful completion of Ship Zero meant that his status in the eyes of the Short-hairs had risen greatly, and he even received an extra bonus.

The technical personnel of the transmigrators, led by Wen Desi, originally lacked confidence in shipbuilding. Although they knew a lot of theory, many practical engineering and technical problems encountered during the process were actually solved by the shipwrights using traditional methods. The transmigrators mainly contributed the overall concept and modern management methods, resulting in a great integration of ancient and modern technologies and ideas.

A few days before the launch, after dismantling the scaffolding, the shipbuilders conducted a general cleaning of the cabins, clearing away wood scraps and scattered loose tools to ensure there were no superfluous objects inside the hull. Immediately, thick hawsers were used to connect the dock walls and the hull to prevent the hull from shaking after water injection.

To reduce the weight of the ship and facilitate floating during high tide, most facilities on the ship were not installed, including masts, cannons, and all ballast; these would wait until after the launch to be installed.

As the water pump poured more and more water into the dock, wood scraps floated up, and the ship began to sway slightly, but because it was moored by hawsers, the amplitude of the swaying wasn't large. The ship had completely floated up. The transmigrators watching around the dock couldn't help but burst into a cheer—the first large ship self-built by the Transmigration Regime finally launched. The native craftsmen didn't know why this group of Short-hairs was so happy, but they laughed along too.

"Cast off port line number one!"

"Cast off starboard line number two!"

...

"Cast off stern line number ten!"

Following Li Di's command orders through the loudspeaker, nine of the ten hawsers on the ship were untied in sequence, leaving only the number zero line at the bow, which was tied to the bollard under the viewing platform. It waited to be finally cut for the launch.

The dock gate slowly opened, and the rising seawater began to pour in. The ship floated further up, reaching the design draft depth.

Accompanied by a din of drums and music, Mund, the representative of the Maritime Department, arrived at the ceremony platform with incomparable excitement. He was wearing a borrowed snow-white British Royal Navy summer dress uniform, complete with a golden sash, and even hung a Victoria Cross (a high-quality replica borrowed from a certain medal enthusiast).

Mund began to read the ship naming certificate with a voice trembling with excitement:

"Warship *Zhenhai*. Construction started February 1, 1629. Completed today. Hereby named, April 9, 1629. People's Commissar of Maritime Power, Chen Haiyang."

The naming of this first self-built warship had caused a small-scale discussion. Many people hoped to name it according to the "Four Great *Yuan*" style (*Dingyuan*, *Zhenyuan*, etc.). But the Navy internally disapproved of this: the Four Great *Yuan* ships themselves had no victories; what they had was a history of humiliation involving defeat, sinking, surrender, or capture. If they were selected merely for the sake of being "tragic and heroic," then the future Transmigration Fleet would be nothing but a tragedy.

Besides this debate, most people didn't know that Li Mei had specifically sought out the Executive Committee, hoping to name the ship "*Women's Cooperative*"—the price being that the Cooperative would be responsible for providing the food expenses for the ship's sailors for three years. She further offered suggestions, saying that future ship naming could be done through bidding, allowing local merchants to purchase naming rights; the winner could name the ship for one year.

This proposal made the Executive Committee laugh and cry. Chen Haiyang jokingly said:

"Then the Navy would be in a mess. Changing names every other year, who could keep it clear?"

"It doesn't matter, just keep the hull number unchanged. No. 111 will always be No. 111. Government departments register by hull number; the name is just a label, change it as you please." Li Mei's train of thought was indeed not just a spur-of-the-moment idea; she had even thought out the details, worthy of being a market veteran.

Finally, the Executive Committee selected *Zhenhai* (Sea Suppressor), a very ordinary traditional name, mainly to correspond to "*Fubo*" (Wave Suppressor). Although one was Chinese style and the other Western style, and their structures were vastly different, their operational positioning was similar: limited armament, balancing transport.

Next, a ceramic vase flew towards the bow. The person throwing the vase was Li Mei. After her paid ship naming plan was rejected, she pestered and pleaded until she secured the job of smashing the bottle. Of course, she provided part of the sponsorship—the meals for all personnel attending the ceremony were provided by the Women's Cooperative's asset, the most luxurious restaurant in East Gate Market, "Half the Sky"—the banners of the Women's Cooperative and Half the Sky were almost pulled onto the viewing platform. Even Ms. Du Wen, who usually appreciated everything the Women's Cooperative did, couldn't stand it anymore—how could such corrupt commercial habits be used on such a solemn occasion?

As the vase smashed into pieces, Wen Desi gave the order to flood. Under the whistle command of flooding director Li Di, workers immediately cut the last mooring rope. The Bopu coastal battery fired a salute, then a motorboat acting as a tugboat carefully towed the ship slowly out of the dock. The entire launch ceremony was completed.

The newly launched *Zhenhai* had no ballast yet and was carefully towed to the side of a self-propelled flatbed barge. This flatbed barge would serve as a floating pier for fitting out the ship. Its broad deck was piled with equipment and materials, and derricks were set up to hoist large equipment like masts and cannons.

Before the smoke of the salute had dispersed, craftsmen swarmed onto the new ship to begin the fitting-out work—the Executive Committee was pressing very hard, and the ship was urgently needed for exploration. To save the shipbuilding cycle, the concept of sheathing the hull bottom with copper sheets was also cancelled. They naturally had copper sheets, but Wen Desi didn't know how to sheathe them onto the hull properly, so this craft that required a lot of time to figure out was abandoned.

"Fitting out can be completed within a week, and then it goes to sea. Hell, what is this?" Wen Desi watched the bustling scene and felt a small piece of sharp porcelain shard from his hat. "Too dangerous. Where is Li Huamei?"

"In the Commercial Hall. People from the Foreign Affairs Ministry, Trade Company, and General Security Bureau are talking to her," Ran Yao reported.

"How are the sailors on her ship?"

"Ten people in total. Except for taking turns watching the ship, they spend their free time drinking, shopping, and whoring in East Gate Market. No special circumstances."

"Hmph, doesn't she have a maid or something by her side? A lone woman at sea with this group of people on a ship for months..."

"It seems this woman is very tough. Fit and very agile. Ordinary sailors probably wouldn't be her match," Ran Yao stated.

"Those guys in the Navy, were they drugged? I don't think this chick looks that great, yet they are all bewitched."

"In my opinion, it's because this woman fits their imagination very well, right? A female pirate, and shares a name with Li Huamei from the glorious *Uncharted Waters*. A bit of romanticism. Also, I think this woman's appearance and words are very modern, fitting everyone's taste quite well."

Wen Desi nodded. "What you said makes sense. How was her visit to the *Fengcheng* yesterday?"

"Could tell she was shocked, but—"

"But what?"

Ran Yao recalled the scene accompanying Li Huamei on the ship yesterday—considering there would inevitably be many questions after boarding, they specially hypothesized potential questions and unified the answers. The navy crowd closest to Li Huamei were called one by one to the office of the Political Security Bureau for individual talks and safety awareness education. Everyone was told that even if they couldn't remember what the standard answer was, saying "I don't know" certainly wouldn't be wrong.

Li Huamei's performance after boarding the ship, however, really gave them no cause for suspicion: running around on the deck, touching the huge anchor chain with her hands, asking what the constantly rotating thing at the top of the mast was, and finally insisting on climbing the mast to take a look, but giving up after being persuaded by accompanying personnel that it was dangerous up there. She was very interested in the two fully enclosed lifeboats tethered to the ship and specially crawled inside to take a look... Naturally, she also wanted to know why such a big iron ship could float on water instead of sinking, and what the iron ship relied on to move forward.

In general, Li Huamei fit all the behaviors of an ordinary person of this era under such circumstances: curiosity, shock, envy, and delight. In Ran Yao's view, Li Huamei's performance couldn't be more normal; it was so normal that no fault could be picked.

"But she showed no special interest."

"What do you mean?"

"What Li Huamei is interested in is the ship itself, not other things. Many questions she raised were quite professional; she knows a lot about navigation."

"That's right, she is a captain. If she didn't know, she wouldn't have been able to sail the ship here, right?"

"Is her purpose in coming to Bopu for trade?"

"Yes, the Navy report specifically mentioned this point. She is very interested in our products."
