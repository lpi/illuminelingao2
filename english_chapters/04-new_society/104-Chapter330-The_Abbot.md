# Chapter 330 - The Abbot

"The method is quite good," Wen Desi said. "But what if Lu Ruohua harbors ulterior motives and uses this hatred to build his own faction of clergy?"

"That depends on Bai Duolu and the others keeping a close watch. Also, we need to mix sand in," He Ying offered a plan. "I think we can select a few particularly loyal people from the school to proactively enter the monastery and serve as the first batch of grassroots clergy in the future."

"That is naturally the ideal way. Selecting indigenous students to enter the monastery is fine, but they are too young and easily influenced. Just a few months of brainwashing may not be enough."

"Then send someone in to control the monastery."

"For the Abbot, isn't Bai Duolu suitable?"

"He has to keep an eye on Lu Ruohua and can't pull himself away." Wen Desi shook his head. "Moreover, he is a believer. Although his faith doesn't seem firm enough, he has faith..."

He didn't finish the sentence, but the implication was clear. The church Wen Desi prepared to establish was typically *sui generis*. Calling it "heretical" wouldn't be an exaggeration.

He Ying pondered: "How about we recruit someone and send them in?"

"Good. Let's select someone later—then I agree to run the monastery. But the location must be in Bairen, not in Daolu Village. In addition, entrants to the monastery must be reported one by one, with clear resumes, for your approval." Wen Desi instructed.

Here, a recruitment notice for a religious professional was posted on the BBS, and someone indeed came to apply. The applicant was surnamed Wu, named Shimang, about thirty years old, slightly chubby, looking all smiles, and not very talkative.

Wen Desi picked up his file to review:

Transmigration Political Security Bureau Personal Assessment of Transmigrator Wu Shimang (Top Secret):

"Born X Month X Day, XXXX. Joined the Transmigration Cause in X Month XXXX. Han ethnicity. Political inclination: No obvious inclination, follows the crowd politically. Personality—relatively introverted, adaptable, not picky about the environment, but will improve it manually when possible. Ruthless to enemies. Noble character, no bad habits, clear social relations. Specialties: Personnel Training (Expert), Combat (General), First Aid (Roughly proficient). Performance—active and motivated, has an urgent desire to serve the organization..."

Wen Desi studied it: *Personnel Recruitment and Training Supervisor—that means he can talk well and hoodwink people; knows some combat skills—no problem going on trips to the countryside, can protect himself; knows first aid and bandaging—useful skills, with some training, he can also coordinate with 'sending medicine to the countryside'.*

"Quite suitable." Wen Desi said, "But to be this Abbot, you have to learn many basic doctrines and go preaching. Do you think you can do it?"

"My learning ability is very strong. As for preaching, it's a piece of cake. I often do training. Even if the organization wants me to do pyramid schemes, it's not a problem."

"Mm, but this position belongs to the clergy; it might involve baptism and taking vows..."

Wu Shimang smiled: "President Wen, you aren't really that pious, are you?"

Wen Desi smiled slightly; it seemed this person's comprehension ability was indeed very strong.

He said: "Formalism is still needed." After all, most Chinese still hoped to see religious professionals upholding an image of poverty and abstinence.

"What are the benefits?"

Wen Desi said: "The church currently only has Bai Duolu alone..."

"Hehe, good, good, good." Wu Shimang beamed with joy. He started talking immediately:

"President Wen, is this a monastery for men or a convent for women—"

"There are both monasteries and convents. There is also the task of raising children. Things won't be few." Wen Desi said, "You'll be busy."

"Nun *MMs* (pretty girls)." This guy's expression started to look wrong.

"It's Nun Grannies." Wen Desi corrected him, then explained the relevant work content to him.

"...The focus is brainwashing, *do you understand*?"

"Understood, understood." Wu Shimang nodded repeatedly. He put forward his own view: "President Wen, I think we shouldn't give the Chinese version of the Bible to Father Lu. In my opinion, it's best if believers cannot see the original text of the Bible."

"Mm," Wen Desi was quite interested in his view. "Why?"

"With the Chinese version of the Bible, wouldn't ordinary believers also master the doctrine?" Wu Shimang voiced the idea he had considered for a long time. "If the official doctrine we promote is different from what the Bible says, wouldn't that give certain people ready-made ammunition?"

"Go on." Wen Desi became interested.

"Well, I don't know much about religious history, but I remember a key thing Martin Luther did during the Reformation was translating the Latin version into German—he certainly didn't do it for amusement. He obviously regarded letting ordinary people master the content of the scriptures as a weapon."

"Going a step deeper, with scriptures, will it cause disputes over doctrinal ambiguity? This is a common occurrence. A word, a sentence, how should it be interpreted? What if believers fight over certain details? If we brainwash them too well and create a group of fanatics who chop each other up first, that would be putting the cart before the horse."

Wen Desi was secretly surprised. He originally thought this Brother Wu was just an opportunist willing to be this religious professional to mix into the upper echelons, but he didn't expect him to have quite some ideas!

"Finally, the matter of Hong Xiuquan cannot be ignored. Back then, Hong Xiuquan created the God Worshipping Society with just a Christian propaganda pamphlet. Now with the full Bible, if any ambitious person uses it to create another God Worshipping Society, things will be troublesome."

"What is your plan then?"

"Recall the Chinese Bibles." Wu Shimang said, "Stipulate that only clergy above a certain level can possess them. Collect the right of interpretation of the doctrine." Seeing Wen Desi listening attentively, he drank some water and continued to elaborate:

"Ordinary believers don't need the Bible. We can compile a few pamphlets like 'Collection of Scriptures' or 'Catechism', publishing some basic doctrines and scriptures used for prayer on various occasions. As for the stories in the Bible, we can select a suitable part and publish a 'Story Collection' specifically." He paused, "Only publish 'Quotations', not 'Selected Works'."

"We possess the final right of interpretation." Wen Desi summarized.

Wu Shimang nodded repeatedly: "That's the meaning. Without the original Bible, any meaning loses its basis. The church can declare unstable elements as 'heretics' at any time and place." He thought for a moment, "We'd better set up an arbitration tribunal enjoying the final right of interpretation of the doctrine. No one is allowed to question it. Finally, grasp all bishop appointment rights in our own hands."

"Mm." Wen Desi was noncommittal. "Not bad. You go get your transfer order first. Then discuss again when Bai Duolu comes back."

After he left, Wen Desi knew clearly that what Wu Shimang said was in line with their ultimate interests. However, they hadn't reached the time to truly show their hand with the church. For now, it was better to maintain low-key cooperation. Let these missionaries lay a solid foundation for brainwashing first.

Wu Shimang took office. His external position was Abbot of Bairen Monastery, and his internal position was Deputy Director of the Religious Affairs Office, same as Bai Duolu. Having become Deputy Director, Wu Shimang asked Wen Desi to send a telegram to Bai Duolu, asking him to manage those Chinese versions of the *Bible* well and strictly prohibit their outflow. So Bai Duolu quietly sent the box full of books back to Bairen for Wu Shimang to keep, of course ostensibly fearing the books getting damp.

Wu Shimang was very enthusiastic. He first went to the Lingao Construction Company and flashed his newly obtained letter of appointment. Under his perseverance and pestering, Mei Lin had to agree to start the construction of the church. However, he stated in advance that he could only provide building materials and some skilled workers; unskilled laborers were in short supply now. Wu Shimang agreed readily, saying unskilled labor would be solved by the church itself.

While busy with infrastructure work, Wu Shimang got quite a few religious books from the Grand Library to study—otherwise, when Lu Ruohua came back, wouldn't his cover as "Abbot" be blown if he knew nothing? Moreover, plans had to be produced for the revision and establishment of doctrines in the future.

"Help me find some pictures." Wu Shimang found the human search engine Luo Duo.

"What pictures?"

"Christian pictures, propaganda posters, and the like," Wu Shimang thought for a moment, "Preferably localized ones."

"Localized—" Luo Duo thought, "Do you mean figures with Chinese styling?"

"Right, exactly that kind. Western style is okay too, but preferably with features not too obvious. Don't want those painted with golden hair. Little Jesus doesn't need to be localized; a chubby white doll is definitely likable."

Luo Duo queried and actually found quite a few. Wu Shimang selected some better-looking ones and found transmigrators who could draw to redraw them. Quite a few paintings were made.

Two young indigenous personnel were also sent from the General Bureau of Political Security. They were two of the orphans taken in from Guangdong. With relatively introverted personalities, after undergoing sufficient brainwashing, they accepted the task, preparing to participate in catechism study as soon as Lu Ruohua returned, then get baptized and enter the monastery.

Lu Ruohua, however, hadn't returned. Although his achievements were remarkable, he knew these new flocks couldn't be said to have much faith yet. So he was busy touring various villages every day to strengthen their faith. That day he just returned from an outer village and saw a strange Australian in the team headquarters sitting and resting, with the new Village Head Liu Si attending diligently on the side.

Lu Ruohua could clearly distinguish who were Australians, who were their indigenous subordinates, and who were the local ordinary natives—the differences in mental state and physical appearance among the three were great.

This person who came, although wearing a local blue cloth shirt, a bamboo hat, straw sandals, and carrying a rattan basket on his back, was tall, physically strong, and fair-skinned. His gestures were full of spirit and high-spiritedness. He was a typical Australian image.

"May the Lord bless you." Lu Ruohua crossed himself. "Are you here to see Ms. Du?"

"Yes, Father." The visitor was very polite. "I am here to deliver medicine."

The visitor was none other than Liu San. After Liu San received Du Wen's letter, because he was busy tending his herb garden and concocting some common medicinal powders according to the needs stated in Dong Weiwei's telegram, he set off a few days late. When he arrived, the entire Thirteen Villages area was already a scene of peace. Dressed in Ming Dynasty attire and disguised as a herb gatherer, he didn't use guards and was quite free and unfettered. Liu San arrived at the team headquarters but missed them; Du Wen and Dong Weiwei were not there. Only Liu Si was there. Hearing his name was Liu San, Liu Si insisted on calling him Big Brother. Actually, Liu San was only 26, younger than Liu Si.

Hearing he was a doctor, Lu Ruohua was very interested. At that time, missionaries who came to Asia and Africa to preach all mastered one or two skills: some astronomy, some technology, some medicine, and some art. They used these specialized skills to penetrate local society.

Medicine was the most effective technology among them. Only in China did the missionaries' medical skills seem very unpopular. Lu Ruohua knew Chinese people had their own unique medical theory and herbalogy, completely different from Europe's. He wanted to take this opportunity to understand—he was most interested in acupuncture. When Dong Weiwei performed acupuncture on locals, Lu Ruohua watched for a long time, always wanting to know what theory acupuncture relied on to cure pain.

Hearing him ask about acupuncture, Liu San thought this foreigner knew his stuff. In the other timeline, the thing about Traditional Chinese Medicine that was most popular in the West was also acupuncture. He began to talk from the theory of Yin-Yang and the Five Elements of the body and meridians. Actually, as a modern Master of Traditional Chinese Pharmacy, Liu San was quite skeptical about this set of traditional, almost shamanistic theories, but acupuncture was purely empirical medicine, and so far there was no scientific theoretical basis to speak of.

Unexpectedly, although Lu Ruohua listened with half-understanding, a look of fascination appeared on his face. Liu San thought to himself: *I don't even understand this stuff very well myself; could this foreign monk understand it?*

"Acupuncture, is it piercing a certain position of the human body with a needle to guide 'Pneuma' directly into these places to generate more 'Vital Spirit'?"

Liu San was tongue-tied, not knowing what he was talking about. Actually, Lu Ruohua was speaking of standard traditional European medical theory, namely Galen's "Pneuma" theory. He had to ask Lu Ruohua what "Pneuma" meant.

"The great physician Galen said: The human body has three kinds of spirits, which are the elements of life. Residing in the liver is the 'Natural Spirit', the center of nutrition and metabolism; residing in the brain is the 'Animal Spirit', the center of sensation and activity; residing in the heart is the 'Vital Spirit', the center of regulating body heat." Lu Ruohua was obviously very familiar with these theories and spoke with fervor, "Pneuma comes from the 'World Pneuma' in the air through breathing..."

Liu San didn't know whether to laugh or cry. It turned out Western medicine also had such shamanistic sayings. He previously only knew the Humorism theory and already thought it was very charlatan-like. He didn't expect there was this even more mysterious "Pneuma Theory," which was comparable to TCM's Yin-Yang and Five Elements.

Originally, he wanted to suggest to the health department to recruit some European doctors from Macau through the church or merchants to absorb local experience. Now it seemed superfluous. Lu Ruohua was obviously an intellectual in Europe too. If intellectuals all trusted this medical tune, it was better to respectfully decline Western medicine in 1629.
