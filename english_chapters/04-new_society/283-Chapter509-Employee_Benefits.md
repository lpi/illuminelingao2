# Chapter 509 - Employee Benefits

"That's right," Xiao Zishan nodded. "You'll be posted out there alone; you can't have no one looking after your daily needs. And even with a computer, leisure time is pretty dull."

Xiao Zishan understood the transmigrators' recreational life all too well. Apart from a handful of technical fanatics who spent every day holed up in their workshops, offices, or laboratories, most people passed their free time using their limited power rations to play games, read novels, or watch pornography on their computers. Hormones were being produced in abundance, but the organs that should be putting them to use were not. Over time, this was bound to affect their health. Recently, the Ministry of Health had reported a rising incidence of non-bacterial prostatitis. Xiao Zishan knew this was mostly the combined result of "holding it in" and "self-relief." So when organizing this deployment, he had specifically requested that the mine director be assigned a "personal secretary."

"This isn't like being posted to Guangzhou or Leizhou, or even Qiongshan. Those are cities, at least—food, drink, and entertainment are decent, and as long as you're not too picky, you can always buy a few soft girls to enjoy," Xiao Zishan mused, thinking of Chang Shide and Wen Tong—those two scoundrels. "Jiazi Coal Mine is in the middle of nowhere; you won't see so much as a female monkey. Providing a woman will help maintain our deployed comrade's physical and mental health."

Xiao Zishan took a document from his drawer.

"I've already handled the paperwork. Go to Hu Qingbai's office and pick one out yourself." He smiled. "Though anyone sixteen or older is eligible, I'd suggest not picking someone too young—you're counting on her to actually work, after all."

"Thank you for the organization's concern!" Tang Menglong's hormones immediately surged; he felt a certain part of his body beginning to react. He quickly added, "Thank you to the Executive Committee for its concern."

"There's also an increased personal-enjoyment allowance." Xiao Zishan handed him another form. "The storage batteries and hand-crank charger you requested are listed. Take a look and see if there's anything else you need; we'll try to arrange it."

"I have nothing more to say." Tang Menglong was practically moved to tears. This was truly thoughtful.

Tang Menglong arrived at Hu Qingbai's office and grandly placed the document on his desk.

Hu Qingbai seemed to have been expecting him: "Ah, Tang Menglong, right? Everything's ready. I'll call her in—"

"Wait!" Tang Menglong cut him off. "Xiao Zishan said I could pick."

"Well," Hu Qingbai sighed, "you should know that the actual selection is rather limited…"

"Who do you think you're fooling?" Tang Menglong said indignantly. "There are plenty of female students in the National School. Don't think you can hide all the good ones and fob off your leftovers on me."

"That's not it at all! Absolutely not." Hu Qingbai protested his innocence and produced a document. "Take a look—this is the Executive Committee directive on the secretary matter."

He explained that, according to the Committee's guidelines, any female student undergoing specialized vocational training could only be selected as a secretary by personnel from her relevant department; personnel from other departments were ineligible. This was to avoid wasting talent. In other words, female students in the nursing program could only serve as secretaries to Ministry of Health personnel.

The problem was that there were currently very few female students not in vocational training. From this pool, one had to subtract those under sixteen, top performers slated for middle school, those in poor health unfit for remote assignments, and those whose appearance was frankly "safe"… By this reckoning, only a small number of female students were available for Tang Menglong to choose from. Based on the conditions at the mine, Hu Qingbai had concluded that the most suitable candidates were from the administrative training class, and he had picked one.

Seeing the document, Tang Menglong had no recourse. Hu Qingbai simply laid out the files of all eligible candidates, and the facts showed that the one he had chosen was indeed the most suitable and the most pleasing to the eye.

"Fine, I'll take this one," Tang Menglong said, still somewhat reluctant.

"Don't worry—a personal secretary's primary job is, after all, to work," Hu Qingbai encouraged. "Besides, the Executive Committee never said you could only have one personal secretary." He rang a bell and said to the administrative intern who entered, "Go fetch Jiang Wenli."

Ten minutes later, a dark-skinned young woman arrived. Her file said she was sixteen, though she looked of indeterminate age. Her build was sturdy. Tang Menglong scrutinized her critically. Her face was plain—passable at best. Her figure was decent: a waist was a waist, a bottom was a bottom. Her one defect was a somewhat small chest—a fairly universal shortcoming among women of this era, owing to a lack of adequate protein in the common diet.

While Tang Menglong was selecting his woman, Dugu Qiuhun was at the sexually transmitted disease quarantine station outside Bairen Fortress, recruiting twenty prostitutes who had passed their STD screenings for the Jiazi Coal Mine. These "stray warblers" who had come to Lingao from the mainland seeking business were now informed: the Australians would soon build a coal mine in the mountains with four or five hundred miners; those willing to go would have plenty of work. Moreover, the Australians would supply rations and clothing to those who went and guarantee each woman her own room.

"…The contract term is one year. At the end of the year, anyone who wishes to stay can renew for another year; anyone who doesn't can return. It's entirely up to you," Dugu Qiuhun announced through a megaphone.

He had no trouble recruiting the necessary prostitutes. With hundreds of hale and hearty men gathered in the remote wilderness, eating their fill and performing heavy labor every day, failure to provide an outlet could easily lead to trouble. Even if they didn't go around stealing chickens, having the camp turn into a "comrades' barracks" was not an outcome the Executive Committee wanted to see.

There were over four hundred workers, all recruited from among the immigrants. Those with prior mining experience could be paid according to their skill level starting immediately. Wu De signed them to one-year contracts at quite generous compensation.

For that year, the coal miners could not return home, could not leave the mine site, and had to eat, sleep, and recreate entirely within the mine compound, subject to strict military discipline:

Without the mine director's consent, no one could leave the mine area. Unauthorized departure would be treated as desertion and punished by summary execution; those captured alive would be returned to Lingao for permanent labor reform. Miners engaging in collective disturbances or refusing orders would likewise be deemed deserters. Inside the living quarters, miners were forbidden to carry knives or any weapons without permission, to prevent brawls. In the event of a fight, anyone who killed would pay with his life; if no deaths occurred, the offenders would have their service extended by one year—without pay.

The mine director wielded enormous power. When Tang Menglong saw the management manual issued to him, he was startled. He was not merely the Jiazi Coal Mine's production leader but its supreme ruler. Only he had the authority to approve suspension of work or departure from the mine for any miner or soldier. He had the power to order the imprisonment, punishment, or execution of any indigenous laborer at the mine. He could increase or reduce rations at will. In short, calling Tang Menglong the "local emperor" of the Jiazi Coal Mine was no exaggeration.

Finally, he possessed unlimited rights of self-defense. If the mine's continued existence was at stake, he could order the killing or capture of any local indigenous person—man, woman, or child. Under the same conditions, he could order the burning or plundering of any local village or settlement. Without his permission, no one in the mine area could engage in trade with local indigenous people, nor could they have any private dealings.

"This looks just like the wicked colonial governors I read about as a kid…"

"Exactly. This regulation is essentially preparation for future colonial outposts," Wu De said. "You'll be managing the mine alone; without some thunderbolt methods, you won't last."

"I understand that, but casually killing people—that I can't stomach…"

"It only means you have the power to kill; it doesn't mean you must. But on key issues, you must stand firm. Never indulge in womanly compassion—when someone needs to die, he dies. Let one person go and you may invite endless trouble." Wu De coaxed gently, inwardly fretting. Judging by Tang Menglong's demeanor, it was unclear whether he could harden his heart when the time came. Fortunately, transmigrators did not have to do their own butchering; there were people to do that for them. Perhaps that would make things easier.

The security team was a platoon of infantry under Huang Xiong's command. Their tour of duty at the mine was also one year, with additional field-duty and meal allowances. Tang Menglong was skeptical that thirty men could adequately protect both the mine and the dock. Wu De thought it was enough.

"The miners themselves constitute an armed force. Four hundred robust men—even if each only held a club—would be a force to reckon with in Qiongshan County. Look at the local gentry in Lingao who called themselves 'strongmen': having one or two hundred able-bodied tenants, household guards, or hired hands was enough to dominate the countryside," Wu De said. "Huang Xiong will help you drill the miners. The Army will also issue you weapons—definitely better than what the Ming regulars at Baisha are equipped with."

Besides the personnel dispatched to the Jiazi Coal Mine, a contingent was sent to the Hai family dock to manage operations and run the machinery—a projected staff of thirty, under Lin Baiguang's direct leadership. They also planned to hire local laborers, for coal transport was grueling work. As for security, no Lingao Security Regiment soldiers would be deployed there—although the area was remote, it was not far from the Baisha naval garrison. Lin Baiguang intended to hire escorts from Qiwei and train some local indigenous people himself. Organizing local militia was commonplace throughout the Ming; with the Hai family's backing, it would be even easier.

Miners and security troops traveled to Qiongshan on the third voyage of *Qionghai Coal*, then proceeded in batches to the mine site via transport boats—the flotilla now numbering twelve vessels.

*Qionghai Coal* also delivered an engineering squad led by Pan Da, along with over a hundred barrels of gunpowder. Completing mine development and road construction within a short timeframe would be impossible without explosives.

The miners, of course, had no idea they had slept atop a colossal powder magazine during their voyage to Qiongshan. Having signed their contracts, they now wore brand-new work uniforms and rested their heads on newly issued oversized duffel bags stuffed with personal supplies. Their weapons and tools traveled in large crates packed separately.
