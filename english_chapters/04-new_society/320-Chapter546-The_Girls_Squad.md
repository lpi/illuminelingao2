# Chapter 546 - The Girls' Squad

The side courtyard contained rows of rooms. The structure and layout were similar to Lu Cheng's accommodation in the quarantine camp, except each room housed only eight people—a far cry from the large rooms of twenty-plus people in the quarantine camp. Since there were only six female cadets out of the forty-plus total, they were all assigned to one dormitory.

Having lived in dorms at the quarantine camp, everyone was already trained. As soon as they put down their backpacks, they hurried to organize their personal housekeeping: arranging cups, hanging towels, making beds, and folding quilts. Then came the election of a dorm head—no one wanted this responsibility-heavy, thankless job, so Lu Cheng, the only one not from Bairen Commune, became the dorm head.

The roommates were all girls from Bairen Commune. In fact, besides her, only women from Bairen Commune had signed up for this recruitment.

The members of Bairen Commune were the indigenous people who had attached themselves to the transmigrated collective earliest. Whether local villagers or immigrant refugees, they had been most deeply influenced by the transmigrated collective, so it was not surprising they were the pioneers in social trends.

Lu Cheng felt these girls looked down on her a bit. Hearing she came from the newly established Jialai Commune, their tone became quite a bit more superior.

"What's there to be haughty about?" Lu Cheng thought to herself. Then the Bairen girls began discussing which scent of the Cooperative's latest soap smelled better—jasmine or rose. One girl even proudly claimed she had used transparent soap.

Lu Cheng felt she was indeed very rustic; she understood nothing of what these girls were discussing. She knew soap—sometimes the Commune assigned work for women to wash bedding and clothes, distributing large blocks of soap—but she had never heard of scented soap, let alone transparent soap.

Next, a girl took out a few paper-wrapped candy balls from her pocket to share. This girl was named Yao Yulan. Her parents worked in the food factory; her father was a technical backbone in the bean-products workshop, earning a high income, so naturally, her consumption level was a cut above the rest.

"It's top-grade fruit candy!" Yao Yulan haughtily gave Lu Cheng one.

Lu Cheng didn't know what fruit candy was. Imitating the others, she peeled off the paper. She had never seen such beautiful confectionery—a crystal-clear yellow candy that seemed to conduct light.

"Eat it!" Yao Yulan was very satisfied with her reaction and said triumphantly.

The fruit candy was indeed delicious, sweet with a palatable tartness and a faint fruit fragrance. Lu Cheng couldn't help but say, "It's good."

The girls all laughed. Lu Cheng had an easygoing nature and laughed along, which reduced the estrangement significantly. Among the six girls, Yao Yulan was the only non-indentured servant—her family originally ran a small tofu shop in Foshan. Later, due to the war in Liaodong, bean prices soared, and seeing the business failing, her father was moved by Liu San's recruitment of artisans to Lingao with excellent benefits. Yao Yulan's father signed up. Finding life in Lingao good, he quickly moved his family and remaining assets there.

Because of this, plus her family's good conditions and loose spending money, Yao Yulan generally looked down on everyone.

There was also one named Yang Cao, the oldest. Everyone was surprised when she said she was twenty-three—a woman that age was usually either a widow or married.

But looking at her appearance: a full figure and eyebrows devoid of fine downy hair, she was clearly no virgin.

This immediately piqued everyone's interest. Under the girls' pressing questions, Yang Cao hemmed and hawed before admitting she used to be an opera singer. She had been sold into a troupe since childhood, and the troupe leader never allowed her to marry.

"To make money for him—" Yang Cao said in a dull voice. "If I married, I couldn't make money for him." Yao Yulan clamored for stories about the troupe, but Yang Cao ignored her, silently organizing the items in her issued backpack.

Lu Cheng had honestly followed the resident police officer's instructions and brought nothing but the clothes on her back. Yao Yulan, however, had brought a small satchel. The satchel was old and showed signs of mending, but Yao Yulan treasured it—Lu Cheng knew this was exclusively for "cadres." She had seen it on the resident police officer in her village, and the village head and militia captain also wore them proudly when going to meetings.

Because of this bag's specific nature, it became a status symbol. People specifically sought out eliminated, old bags for their own use, turning it into a fashion.

This bag was likely a hand-me-down from some cadre. Lu Cheng knew that to get such a bag, one either had family or relatives who were cadres or had special "connections" and some spare cash.

Most of the girls had brought some private items, like candy, soap, rouge, handkerchiefs, combs, and similar trinkets girls liked.

For a while, the dormitory seemed to be hosting a noisy exhibition. The girls showed off their things while Lu Cheng had nothing and could only stand blankly to one side. She coveted their items; everything was so exquisite and beautiful. Her family's income wasn't low, but expenses were cut drastically for her brother's marriage, and Jialai Commune had no shops selling such things. She felt a bit melancholy. Especially Yao Yulan—just a "Tofu Beauty"! She herself had once been the young miss of a fabric shop, after all.

A while later, a female cadre entered the dorm. Her clothes were ironed crisp and stiff, but she looked very childish, seemingly younger than all the girls in the room. Lu Cheng knew this cadre was an indigenous person, not a Chief—female Chiefs were pitifully rare. Lu Cheng had seen a female Chief inspecting the quarantine camp: a tall woman, looking particularly sturdy, with very white skin, feeling a bit different from Great Ming women.

"Attention!" she shouted. The girls hurriedly stood up and automatically formed a line.

"I am He Chun," the female cadre introduced herself. Though she spoke loudly, her nervousness was visible. "Political Security NCO Cadet, and also your Squad Leader." Her gaze swept the room. "Who is the dorm head?"

"I am—" Lu Cheng hurriedly raised her hand.

"Why didn't you shout 'Attention' when you saw me enter?"

Lu Cheng was flustered, freezing for a moment, not knowing what to say.

"I am your Squad Leader now!" He Chun tried hard to project "official authority." In truth, before being transferred here as Squad Leader, she had been scolded again by Zhou Dongtian—Zhou thought she was too thin-skinned to handle preliminary interrogations and kicked her back to await reassignment.

Being returned for reassignment was serious for an intern; it meant a "incompetent" remark on the performance evaluation. As a Political Security NCO cadet, He Chun understood the importance of evaluations better than anyone. She viewed this Squad Leader assignment as a good chance to turn things around. He Chun fully recalled everything she had seen, heard, and suffered when she was a refugee and a cadet, and she had even gone to the army training camp to learn from their experience. One could imagine what these girls were about to encounter.

"You are now cadets of the First Short-Term Training Class of the General Political Security Bureau!" He Chun tried her best to look severe, reciting a modified version of what she had heard during her own training. "Throw your civilian habits aside! This isn't a place for you to muddle your way into becoming cadres; it's a place for you to be reborn! This work requires a high degree of discipline and self-sacrifice. From now on, all actions must obey commands—first and foremost, my commands! Now, inspection of housekeeping!"

Then began the housekeeping inspection. She unceremoniously dumped everyone's bag upside down, scattering items all over the beds. Personal items that violated regulations were thrown directly onto the floor. A handkerchief Yao Yulan brought was not only thrown down but deliberately stomped on. Yao Yulan was so angry she shed tears.

The next day, training officially began. The training class was organized under the lead of the Military-Political Academy. Zhao Manxiong listed the curriculum for each class and personally supervised its implementation. Each short-term class focused on specific professional training. Although the duration was short, the training was strict, even harsh.

"Left—face!"

Over forty cadets repeated simple movements on the drill ground: left face, right face, mark time, forward march… For every ten people, a corporal was in charge. Eyes wide, carrying a rattan stick, he walked back and forth along the line. A wrong turn or a mistaken movement earned a lash of the stick or a kick to the ground.

"Idiot! Fool!" Besides commands, the corporals shouted nothing but such verbal abuse.

Lu Cheng held a dummy gun inlaid with iron bars—this was a training rifle, 20% heavier than the standard Minié rifle used by the army. Even a man would find it heavy, let alone a woman. Her arms were so sore and numb they were losing sensation, but she stood straight, struggling to grip the gun—if the gun tilted, Yang Cao, who was crying and trying to crawl up at her feet, was the best example of the consequences.

It was still early spring, but sweat had turned their blue cotton fatigue uniforms black.

The first item of the training class was military drill. The girls' squad received no preferential treatment—not in training rifles, time, nor content. The only privilege was that He Chun, as a young girl, was embarrassed to shout the fluent profanities used by the corporals. But in exchange, the rattan stick waved more frequently. Lu Cheng's buttocks and thighs stung with pain; she didn't know how many hits she had taken. But she was better off than Yao Yulan—who was lying on the ground unable to move. No matter how He Chun beat her, she wouldn't get up, until she was dragged aside and doused with a bucket of cold water.
