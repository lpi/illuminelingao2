# Chapter 456 - Autumn Levy (Part 7)

Zhou Botao's subordinates had proposed a crude but direct method: simply drug Zhou Qi unconscious and toss him into Qiuhong's bed, then lure Chen Minggang over. Though rough, it would certainly be effective. Even if Chen Minggang knew it was a setup, for the sake of his reputation he'd have to expel Zhou Qi.

However, this approach would have severe aftereffects—Chen Minggang would immediately realize someone was targeting him, putting him on guard. Moreover, after a site inspection, Zhou Botao felt the operation wouldn't be easy. Six or seven of Chen Minggang's men were stationed around Qiuhong's residence keeping watch, with another four or five servants inside the courtyard. Too many people were involved. Chen Minggang wasn't a fool.

Operating outside was equally difficult. According to the surveillance reports, Qiuhong seldom went out—Chen Minggang generally didn't allow her to leave anyway. She wasn't a local and had no acquaintances in the county to visit. Lingao was a small place with no decent temples—even the common leisure activity of making temple offerings, typical for women in ancient society, was unavailable.

With her secluded like this, there was nothing to be done. They couldn't get in, and they couldn't draw her out. Unable to devise a better plan, Zhou Botao could only have the Special Propaganda Team continue spreading rumors and gossip.

Zhou Qi himself remained completely oblivious. After the autumn levy began, he was extremely busy. Chen Minggang had delegated most of the work to him. Zhou Qi took this as a sign of his master's trust—he had been anxious about the incident with Qiuhong being beaten, but now felt somewhat reassured that his standing with his master hadn't diminished.

Although this year they had played the "land survey" card, his master had already briefed them that the key was to "negotiate terms" with the major households.

"Our own share of benefits—that must be negotiated first," Chen Minggang instructed him. "But we must also keep the Australians happy. The major households need to cough up some of the land they've previously underreported, hidden, or falsely registered—only then can this matter be settled."

As for how much each household would cough up, although the specific amounts were negotiable, Chen Minggang had prepared a list with minimum requirements. Each household had to report at least some acreage according to their scale; trying to bribe their way out without reporting a single *mu* was absolutely unacceptable.

Chen Minggang understood clearly: to borrow the Australians' authority, he had to produce real results. Operating purely on bribes wouldn't work under the Australians' watch.

Zhou Qi understood his master's intentions perfectly. So these past days he had been rushing about the countryside, essentially spending all his time negotiating terms and bargaining.

Naturally, things weren't going smoothly. Chen Minggang's demands were harsh: not only did each household have to report some hidden land, but the tribute rice amounts had also increased. In the past, some grain households had paid no tribute rice or only a token amount; this time, Chen Minggang was uncompromising, insisting they pay in full according to the prescribed quotas.

"If we don't squeeze them hard now, we may never get another opportunity like this," Chen Minggang instructed him. "Don't be afraid of pushing too hard or saying harsh words. With the Australian masters backing us up, what do you have to fear? We're not afraid of things getting ugly—Dang Namen was so arrogant, and his head still ended up hung from the city gate!"

While this was all true, Zhou Qi didn't want to proceed this way. His master was his master; he was himself. Whether he could ever become a yamen clerk himself remained uncertain—given the current situation, he probably had no hope. Chen Minggang had three sons, the eldest already twenty. His master was still relatively young and could easily continue for another ten years, after which the position would naturally pass to his own son. Who knew what attitude that junior apprentice-brother would take toward him then?

He wasn't an official clerk—when all was said and done, he was merely an unregistered hand. Ancient times also placed great importance on "establishment." Zhou Qi operated on the principle that more friends meant more options, so he remained extremely courteous to the major households and always made clear upfront that this came from "above," not from his own initiative.

"This humble one also has no choice," he would say with a pleasing smile to the major households. "Look at me—I'm thirty years old without even a wife, just scraping by. Please, gentlemen, show some understanding!"

These words amounted to hinting: The benefits aren't going to me. Blame those who deserve the blame.

Liu Family Village.

"So you're saying we absolutely must report more acreage to get through this?" Liu Guangbiao asked.

Liu Youren had sent Liu Guangbiao to negotiate terms with Zhou Qi on behalf of the Liu family—this way, if negotiations collapsed, there would still be room to maneuver.

"Exactly." Zhou Qi nodded definitively. "The Australians want to conduct a land survey. They can't just make thunder without rain, can they? They need some face, at least."

"Hmm, that makes sense." Liu Guangbiao stared hard at Zhou Qi, trying to discern some trick from his expression, but Zhou Qi's face remained wreathed in smiles, deferential and obliging.

"Old Seventh, just draw the line—how much is the price?" Liu Guangbiao asked.

"Let's not rush to discuss prices. First, may I ask Third Master Liu's intention—how much does Liu Family Village plan to report?" The amount of additional land reported directly affected the amount of private fees. This point couldn't be mistaken.

Zhou Qi had Chen Minggang's bottom-line list. He had handled grain payment matters for Liu Family Village before and knew they had less than four hundred *mu* on the tax register. But Liu Youren actually owned over two thousand *mu*.

"How about five hundred *mu* total of assessable land?"

---

"How much land Master Liu actually has, you know better than I," Zhou Qi said slowly. "Besides, with the vast Jialai Plains right there, you can't very well claim you only have five hundred *mu*—the Australian chiefs aren't fools, you know."

Liu Guangbiao understood this meant that offering to report just one or two hundred extra *mu* wouldn't cut it. He said, "Old Seventh, what you're suggesting is—"

"At least half must be reported. Twelve hundred *mu*."

"Twelve hundred *mu*!" Liu Guangbiao acted as if terrified. "How is that acceptable? That's too... too..."

"Third Master Liu!" Zhou Qi emphasized his tone. "Don't be heartbroken. With half reported, you still keep the other half! If you think that's too much, when the Australians come out to survey the land themselves—then I'm afraid every fraction of every *mu* will be recorded in their registers..."

Liu Guangbiao knew this was an opening bid, waiting for him to counter. He thought for a moment.

"Just name your price—what's the maximum reduction?"

The two sides haggled back and forth, finally settling on terms: Liu Family Village would newly report two hundred thirty *mu*, bringing their total assessable land to just over seven hundred *mu*. As for tribute rice, both parties agreed that this year it would be three *dou* three *sheng* per *shi* of base levy—also an increase; in the past, Liu Family Village's tribute rice had been only one *dou* two *sheng*. Of the increase, one full *dou* was Chen Minggang's "private fee." This amount was unprecedented.

After seeing Zhou Qi off, Liu Youren, who had been listening in the back hall throughout, slowly emerged. Liu Guangbiao hurried to greet him.

"Third Uncle! What do you think—"

"It's fine. You handled this well." Liu Youren sighed. Although Zhou Qi's tone had been respectful, Chen Minggang's crew had truly enormous appetites this year. In the past, a mere eight or ten taels of silver would have settled matters. This time, besides adding tribute rice and reporting hidden land, they'd even dared to include their private fees within the tribute rice!

"These Australians are truly causing endless harm!" Liu Guangbiao said bitterly. "Chen Minggang never dared be this arrogant before!"

"Mm." Liu Youren said nothing. By now he fully understood. This so-called land survey was probably indeed the Australians' idea—but Chen Minggang had exploited it, turning it into a tool for extortion and enrichment. Otherwise, there would be no need to pressure everyone to report hidden land, and reporting too little wouldn't do—Chen Minggang also knew the Australians couldn't be casually fooled; there had to be tangible results.

He only found it strange that the Australians would let Chen Minggang and his gang run amok. Given their capabilities, if they surveyed the land themselves, wouldn't it be more accurate? And less disruptive to the people...

Liu Youren suddenly realized: if the Australians really surveyed the land themselves, major households like him would have no room for maneuvering at all! They'd probably have to report every last *mu* exactly as it was. Come to think of it, having a parasite like Chen Minggang around had its advantages.

Still, the resentment from being extorted couldn't be shaken off.

"To think I must humble myself before such petty men!" he said bitterly. It seemed that to avoid being bullied, he'd need to establish direct connections with the Australians. If even Chen Minggang wasn't afraid to associate openly with the Australians and do their bidding, why should he—a rural landowner with a purchased *jiansheng* degree—be afraid?

"When Chief Xun arrives, treat him well," he instructed Liu Guangbiao. "Get closer to him, build a relationship. Tell him about this situation."

"Yes, your nephew understands!"

"Also, the Meilan matter—you need to devote more thought to it. I think when Chief Xun comes this time, have Meilan serve him..." At this point he realized it was too improper. Meilan wasn't a maidservant; she couldn't simply be pushed onto someone. That would actually make them look down on her.

"Your nephew will figure something out." Liu Guangbiao understood immediately.

"Has her father agreed?"

"The chance to befriend an Australian master—her father is beside himself with joy." Liu Youren knew, of course, that this nephew was talking nonsense, and had probably used some combination of threats and inducements. But this didn't matter: Liu Meilan's family was insignificant within the clan, and no one cared about their opinions.

"When the memorial rice is distributed at year's end, give her family a bit extra," Liu Youren said. "And the dowry for Meilan's wedding—let it come from the common fund. Let her marry in proper style."

"Third Uncle thinks of everything!" Liu Guangbiao smiled. "Not only her family can receive more—every branch can get substantially more memorial rice this year. The harvest really was excellent. Better than all our neighbors! Joining the Tiandihui was truly the right move, sir."

Speaking of the harvest, Liu Youren's mood finally brightened a little: Fortunately, this year's harvest wasn't bad!

First, the weather had been favorable without major disasters. Second, after joining the Tiandihui, Chief Xun had been genuinely devoted, using many methods to help them farm. Some methods he found unremarkable, but others were quite extraordinary. The paddies had already been drained for sun-drying, and although Liu Youren was a landlord, he was well-versed in farming. Looking at this year's rice ears, he saw not only more stalks per plant but also that each was notably heavier. He casually picked one and counted—not only were there far more grains than before, but there were very few empty or shriveled heads.
