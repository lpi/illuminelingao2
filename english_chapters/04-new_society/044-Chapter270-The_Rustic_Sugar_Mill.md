# Chapter 270 The Rustic Sugar Mill

Wen Tong set up his base of operations in Xuwen. Qiwei had already received word from Manager Guo to take good care of this "Shopkeeper Wen." Hearing that Shopkeeper Wen didn't like the bustle of the city, the Leizhou branch had built a new house on one of the sugarcane estates outside Xuwen County town. It was tidied up inside and out, and even the furniture was newly made. They had originally planned to find some servants to attend to him, but Guangzhou had already prepared everything and sent them over by mule cart. This left the branch manager astounded—these big shopkeepers really lived lavishly.

Wen Tong and his entourage moved into this sugarcane estate, which was really just a somewhat refined farmyard. Besides the main house, there was a very large threshing yard specifically for piling the harvested sugarcane. The rustic sugar mill stood just outside the estate wall—another structure with several oxen kept on the premises.

After resting for the night, Wen Tong inspected the property. He had originally assumed such an estate would have a manager, craftsmen, and similar personnel. But when he asked, there was nobody. This estate, sugar mill included, had been the private property of a single farming family. Planting, juicing, and sugar-making had all been handled by that household alone. After the purchase, naturally, no one was there to manage things.

Wen Tong felt somewhat at a loss. Without locals around, he was fumbling in the dark about the local situation. Moreover, sugarcane was a quintessentially labor-intensive industry—the harvest season required massive manpower. In another spacetime, it would have been easy: cane farmers delivered goods directly to the factory door, and the sugar mill just had to weigh and purchase. Now he had his own land, and the sugarcane hadn't even been harvested yet. He needed to find day laborers to organize the cutting, cleaning, and bundling. This kind of thing required a professional landlord or a gang boss of long-term laborers to handle. He was just a factory director—how was he supposed to manage?

Looking at the Qiwei Escort Agency people beside him, they were equally clueless, clearly all outsiders. Chang Shide, seeing his troubled expression, asked, "Is the matter difficult to handle?"

"Without local help, I'm completely in the dark." Wen Tong sighed and called over Li Biao, Zhou Shizhai's young apprentice. The boy had already learned fluent Mandarin in Lingao.

"Go around the estate and ask if there are any cane farmers nearby who bring their sugarcane here for processing. If there are, please invite them all to the estate. I have some questions to ask."

"Got it, I'll go right now."

Looking through the land deeds, the entire estate owned no more than a hundred modern *mu* of sugarcane fields. This scale was pitifully small. Wen Tong then went to see the sugar mill.

Wen Tong had visited rustic sugar mills on the Leizhou Peninsula before. He knew the local sugar-making process was "ox-powered stone rollers for crushing cane, cooking stoves for boiling sugar, and pottery vessels for separating molasses." Though primitive by modern standards, it was relatively advanced for its time.

The entire sugar mill covered quite a large area, for storing raw sugarcane and bagasse. The main buildings were a conical thatched shed and a large grass-walled hut. The whole structure was crudely built. The materials, let alone bricks and tiles, didn't even include much wood. It was all so-called "thatch-tiled and grass-walled."

The thatched shed was about fifty *chi* at the base and about thirty *chi* tall. The interior was supported by hemp bamboo, with the roof thatched with cogon grass, rice straw, or sugarcane leaves. This was where the sugarcane was crushed. The boiling hut contained rows of *Kongming tripod* stoves for cooking the sugar. Inside was an assortment of equipment: wooden rollers, large pots, stoves, earthenware vats, and so on.

Having not been used for several months, everything was covered in dust. The ground was muddy earth, littered with cane leaves, cane rinds, cow dung, kindling, and all manner of refuse. The building was drafty, with rat droppings everywhere—even in the sugar-cooking pots.

Wen Tong knew that even in modern sugar factories, conditions couldn't exactly be called sanitary. But the sight before him was truly pitiful. The hardships of starting a business were real indeed.

Seeing Shopkeeper Wen's tightly furrowed brow, those accompanying him knew he was displeased, but didn't understand why—all the sugar mills in Leizhou Prefecture were more or less the same. What exactly had displeased him?

Walking out of the crushing shed, Wen Tong found a clean stone in the yard and was about to sit down when a young man in blue clothes and a small cap popped up from beside him, quickly unfolded a portable chair, and slid it under him:

"Please sit, Master." The young man said softly, head lowered.

Wen Tong was startled—locals who could speak Mandarin were rare: "Who are you?"

Liao Dahua, the branch manager of Qiwei, hurried over to explain: "This is someone Manager Guo in Guangzhou specially sent to attend to you, Shopkeeper. His name is Wen Xiu."

"Wen Xiu? What a girlish name." Wen Tong commented offhandedly.

The young servant's face immediately flushed red, and he stood silent, hands at his sides.

"This one's practically an androgynous beauty," Chang Shide remarked after sizing him up. The young man looked about sixteen or seventeen, with fair skin, rosy lips, white teeth, and delicate features—somewhat feminine in appearance. But he noticed the boy's hat was rather peculiar—it looked like a melon-skin cap, but much larger. Had the Manchu fashion already spread this far south?

"What kind of hat is that?"

"This is a *Liuhe Yitong* cap," Liao Dahua hastily explained. "It was personally designed by the founding emperor of this dynasty—"

"What? The melon-skin cap was invented by Zhu Yuanzhang?" Chang Shide muttered. This was beyond his expectations. He had always thought this style of headwear, so perfectly matched with the pigtail, was an innovation of the Great Qing.

Hearing him baldly speak the founding emperor's taboo name, both Liao Dahua and Wen Xiu, who understood Mandarin, turned pale. Liao Dahua quickly said, "Master Chang, please be careful! Be careful! That is the taboo name of our dynasty's founding emperor—you shouldn't speak it so—"

"So I've heard. I don't know the details; Yu Eshui mentioned it." Wen Tong was speaking when he suddenly noticed something. "Why hasn't a chair been brought for Master Chang too?"

For convenience of address in public, Chang Shide's nominal title was Wen Tong's "counselor." This avoided complications and confusion among the locals.

"Master Chang's chair—Wen Qing went to get it. I'll go check now." Wen Xiu had originally been somewhat disinclined to bother with this dark-faced, bearded, flat-topped, burly fellow—in his view, this big dark man was probably just a foreman of laborers that Wen Tong had brought. In this spacetime, dark skin was often seen as a mark of the lower classes. Chang Shide had experienced this many times in Lingao.

After a while, Wen Xiu returned with another boy. Besides bringing a stool, they also carried a tray with two cups of tea.

Chang Shide settled in comfortably and took a sip of tea, then suddenly said to Wen Tong, "It seems going on missions is the way to go. What decadent luxury! I wonder if there are any maidservants?" He craned his neck and looked around.

"To answer the Master, there are no maidservants," Wen Qing replied respectfully. "Only two maids were hired for cooking and laundry."

"Young Guo really doesn't know how to arrange things. How can we do without maidservants—" He was still speaking when he noticed both young servants were covering their mouths to stifle laughter. He realized his words had been indiscreet and had damaged his image considerably.

Wen Tong, however, wasn't thinking along those lines. He instructed Liao Dahua to send people out to find the former workers of this sugar mill. If they were willing to come back to work, they could return—at good wages. Liao Dahua agreed and sent people out to search.

Two groups went out. In the meantime, Wen Tong and Chang Shide sat facing each other under the 17th-century sky, smelling the wind-borne scent of rotting cow dung, sugarcane, and sugar, drinking tea. They were surrounded by more than a dozen people, all standing at attention in reverent silence. The two of them felt rather uncomfortable. Eventually, they managed to persuade Liao Dahua to sit down as well; everyone else remained standing.

"When they told me to go on a business trip, I was actually a bit scared," Chang Shide's eyes gleamed. "I thought staying in Lingao was safe. I didn't expect that once I went out, I'd be living like a big landlord. If I'd known, I would have applied to be an intelligence agent or something. That kid Guo Yi has probably taken a concubine by now, or at least has four or five bedwarmers!"

"So go take one yourself," Wen Tong wasn't interested in this topic. He was worried about his responsibilities.

An hour later, both groups returned. Three sugar mill workers came. Through a translator, Wen Tong learned that none of the three were skilled workers. According to them, the entire sugar mill used five people: the sugar-boiling master, the cane-crusher, the ox-handler, the fire-tender, and the general laborer. The farming family that had originally grown the cane had provided their own people for the sugar-boiling and cane-crushing.

"If the master wants to make sugar, he'll need to hire a good sugar-boiling master to lead," the fire-tender reported. "Otherwise, the timing is hard to control, and the amount of lime to add won't be right. The difference in sugar yield is significant."

Wen Tong nodded and asked them what the entire production process was like. Could they do an on-site demonstration? The fire-tender said a demonstration was possible, but since none of them were sugar-boiling masters, the sugar produced might not be usable.

"Just have them do it," Wen Tong told the interpreter. "Don't worry about whether the sugar turns out well or not."

The three huddled together for a discussion, then got to work. They also enlisted two escort guards to help. They led an ox from the barn and brought over several bundles of sugarcane. Liao Dahua, knowing that Shopkeeper Wen found the rustic sugar mill too dirty, quickly had his people thoroughly sweep and clean the entire facility and wash all the equipment. Only then did they begin making sugar.

The workers first stripped the sugarcane clean and bundled it into loads placed beside the wooden rollers. These wooden rollers were made of lychee wood and were extremely hard. One person fed the cane into the rollers while another drove the ox to turn the crushing rollers. The first roller was turned, and through wooden cogs, it drove the second roller. The rollers squeezed together; the cane was pressed three times to extract all the juice.

On the third pressing, the workers further tightened the rollers inward to squeeze the bagasse drier. The pressed juice ran down the base groove of the rollers and through a bamboo tube into a large earthenware vat to settle.

Wen Tong observed very carefully. The crushing force of these wooden rollers seemed quite strong, but in reality, they weren't as good as the Qing Dynasty rollers he'd seen later—at least those were made of stone, which was much harder. He picked up some of the bagasse with his fingers—after three pressings, the remaining juice content was still quite high.

The crushing took about forty minutes. By then, the water buffalo used for driving the rollers was covered in sweat, its pace slowing. It was clearly very strenuous. The workers began to swap out the ox. Wen Tong asked: for each crushing session, four bundles of cane were processed. The oxen had to be changed thirty to thirty-five times in a full day and night. No wonder this sugar mill kept four or five oxen.

He had the weight of each bundle of sugarcane measured, then made some mental calculations. With this level of processing, working around the clock produced just under 2,000 kilograms. Moreover, according to the workers, the wooden rollers often broke down and required repairs, causing considerable downtime.

"Are there stone rollers for crushing cane?" Wen Tong asked.

The workers all said they'd never seen or heard of such a thing. Among the thirty to fifty sugar mills in the area, none used stone rollers.

Wen Tong nodded. It seemed this technological improvement had appeared in the Qing Dynasty. Stone rollers could process 2,500 kilograms per day and night—a significant increase in efficiency.

The crushed cane juice, after initial settling and a cursory skimming of debris and plant stems, was poured into large iron pots for boiling. Three large pots were arranged in a triangular formation. Wen Tong couldn't see what benefit this arrangement had for the production process or efficiency. The only thing he could think of was that it might concentrate heat.

When the cane juice was boiled down to a syrup, on the verge of boiling, the fire-tender began using a large ladle to skim off the foam and impurities on top. Then, using sugarcane leaves, he scooped some lime from the lime sack and sprinkled it in.

"Lime?" Chang Shide was quite surprised.

"It's used to clarify the sugar solution." Wen Tong explained. To remove the suspended particles in the cane juice and obtain cleaner crystals, an important step in the process was to filter out insoluble matter and then add a clarifying agent. Lime was one of the common clarifying agents used in modern sugar factories. Naturally, the same was true in ancient times—lime was much easier to obtain than clarifying agents like sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, or superphosphate. Some places making rustic sugar used wood ash, which served a similar purpose.

"But doesn't the lime dissolve into the sugar water? So all white sugar contains lime?"

"No, it actually neutralizes and breaks down the various impurities in the cane juice—" Wen Tong explained patiently. "Neither white sugar nor brown sugar contains a trace of lime."

"Well, that's a relief."

By now the cane juice had turned yellow. Several workers worked together to pour the liquid from the first pot into the second pot to slowly evaporate the water, while the first pot repeated the previous process.

When the higher-sugar-content juice was transferred to the third pot, they added some oil. Wen Tong asked, "What are you adding?"

The worker quickly replied, "Peanut oil."

"Peanut oil?" Wen Tong was puzzled. He remembered reading in sugar industry books that the earliest decolorizing treatment used milk, and the Chinese method used egg whites from chicken or duck eggs. The principle was to use protein to remove impurities. Did oil count as protein?

Puzzled as he was, he decided to continue watching. After the cane syrup was boiled down to a thin paste, it was taken out and poured into "*wa liu*" molds. Wen Tong had seen Qing Dynasty examples of these in the past; they looked almost identical to what he saw now: conical in shape, wider at the top and narrower at the bottom, about one *chi* tall. A small hole at the pointed bottom was plugged with rice straw, and the mold was placed over a large earthenware vat to let the sugar slowly crystallize. The syrup, containing a large amount of impurities, would slowly drain through the rice straw and out the small hole. Eventually, only pure crystallized sugar would remain in the *wa liu*. Wen Tong asked and learned that one *wa liu* could produce about 10 kilograms of raw brown sugar.
