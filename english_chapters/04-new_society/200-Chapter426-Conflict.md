# Chapter 426 Conflict

"I don't know. Come, tell me about it." Wang Ci didn't care about matters of status and pulled him aside to sit down, asking him to tell him all about the Australians' school.

Lu Da then told him the full story of the National School. Wang Ci listened very carefully. He didn't ask Lu Da what the Lu Jia and Lu Yi brothers had learned—Lu Da hadn't studied and asking would be useless. However, Lu Da said with great pride that his two sons were learning the Australians' knowledge.

"The Australians' knowledge?" Wang Ci didn't understand for a moment.

"Yes, things like this land reformation—how to draw lines, how to dig dirt—it was all done by my son Lu Jia."

Lu Da was bragging. Actually, Lu Jia had only participated in the surveying and mapping of agricultural water conservancy as an apprentice. Lu Da, with a father's vanity, had bestowed this honor upon him.

Wang Ci wasn't quite convinced—though he didn't understand the Australians' knowledge, it certainly wasn't something an illiterate country boy could learn.

"Who are the teachers?"

"There are Australian Chiefs, and there are also scholars from the Great Ming..."

"There are scholars from the Great Ming?"

"Yes, there are several. One is a local, surnamed Zhang. I heard he was originally from the Gou Family Manor..."

"That must be Zhang Xingjiao!"

Wang Ci knew this person because Zhang Xingjiao was a registered *tongsheng* in the county. Although he hadn't passed the examination, he was still under the jurisdiction of Wang Ci as County Educational Director. The Zhang Xingjiao family had originally been reasonably well-off, but later they were oppressed by Gou Da and had their family ruined. Zhang Xingjiao was arrested and brought to the county yamen and almost cangued for owed grain. It was only after Wang Ci himself pleaded on his behalf that his little life was spared. After that, there was no news of him for a long time. He hadn't expected him to have joined the Short Hairs! Considering that the Short Hairs attacked the Gou Family Manor as soon as they landed, he was probably the one who lured and led them.

Wang Ci didn't blame him for doing this—it was revenge for family wrongs! Besides, the Gou Family were not good people to begin with; destroying them removed a scourge from Lingao. But to continue to be a bandit after his revenge was exacted, that was a failure of moral principle. Wang Ci thought he should find a way to see him and advise him not to mix with the Short Hairs anymore—after all, he was also Zhang Xingjiao's teacher.

Thinking this, he nodded: "Are there any other scholars?"

"That I don't know. I heard they came from over in Guangdong."

"Are there any *xiucai*?"

"Probably not. Don't *xiucai* have to stay in their own county to receive the stipend silver and cold pork?"

These words were said without thinking, but Wang Ci felt a mocking edge to them: the students of Lingao, let alone the stipend silver, hadn't received even the cold pork customary at sacrificial ceremonies for several years. These past few years, every sacrifice used a pig's head instead of a whole pig. After the sacrifice, it became his exclusive property as the Educational Director—in truth, a pig's head wasn't easy to divide.

Half-heartedly, he asked: "Do they learn to read?"

"Of course, of course, they learn to read." As he spoke, Lu Da took out a small booklet from his chest. "My son even wanted to teach me to read. I said I don't have the time or the brains for it! But he said anyone can learn. He even said something about 'no discrimination in education.'"

Wang Ci laughed: unexpectedly, the Australians knew this too—the Australians he had encountered were people of vulgar speech. But since they claimed to be descendants of Cathay and the Song Dynasty, reading a few tomes of the Four Books and Five Classics wasn't strange. However, Wang Ci thought, in his contact with the Australians, he hadn't felt that they understood these things. Several times when he spoke and mentioned the allusions from the Four Books, that Grand Chief Wu Nanhai had a look of complete incomprehension.

They seemed to know a lot, but when they spoke, they seemed uneducated. He didn't know what the Australians' knowledge actually was. He casually flipped through the booklet Lu Da gave him, quite curious. He had seen the Australians' letters, notices, and newspapers, but this was the first time seeing a book.

The book was printed quite simply, on slightly yellowed paper, but it felt very smooth to the touch. On the cover was the title in regular script: *New National Literacy Textbook Volume One (Trial Edition)*. Wang Ci half-understood this title and didn't bother with it. When he opened it, he was startled: the book was printed so exquisitely!

The paper was pristine, each character upright, the strokes all of uniform thickness, and most remarkably, the characters were all exactly the same size. There were no ink stains between characters either. It was extremely clean to look at.

"Good book!" Wang Ci praised it. Even in the large bookshops of Guangzhou, you couldn't buy such exquisite books—the saying that everything the Australians made was finely crafted was indeed true.

But it felt very awkward to hold; the book opened from the right to the left, and the text was written horizontally from left to right—very unfamiliar at first. Looking further, it was a primer similar to the *Three Character Classic*, with folk songs and ditties as well, but all in simplified characters. Wang Ci's disdain increased somewhat—after all, having gone overseas and lived among barbarians, they had lost the orthodox origin of Chinese culture.

Looking at the content, the writing was crude and incomprehensible. Wang Ci just shook his head while reading—if this was supposed to be a primer, it was simply misleading children. Full of simplified characters, wouldn't writing them make people laugh? Not to mention taking examinations with them. In his view, the only advantage was that whether it was songs or short sentences, they were all punctuated, saving the primer teacher a lot of effort.

Turning to the very front, there were strange symbols like ghost scribbles. Wang Ci didn't recognize them and asked: "What is this?"

"Lu Jia said they're called phonetic letters. They're also a kind of writing."

These must be the Australians' characters, Wang Ci thought.

"...Lu Jia said that in the school, when learning to read, they first start from these letters. After learning them all, then they learn characters, and the learning is faster—"

"Absurd!" Wang Ci flew into a rage and threw the book on the ground. Learning barbarian letters before Chinese characters—wasn't this transforming Chinese into barbarians?! And this group of Australians dared to claim to be descendants of Cathay! A bunch of people forgetting their ancestors and abandoning tradition!

Lu Da didn't know why this Master Wang had suddenly flown into a rage and thrown the literacy textbook his son had solemnly entrusted to him on the ground. He hurriedly picked up the book and wiped it off.

"Master Wang—"

"This book, you'd better not let your children read it—it's misleading children, misleading children!" Wang Ci said with righteous indignation.

Lu Da stared blankly at the Educational Director whose face was somewhat distorted, thinking this official must have been possessed by phlegm. Why had he suddenly had an episode? He didn't dare speak and just mumbled along.

After Wang Ci's outburst, he suddenly remembered that the person before him was just a mud-leg and illiterate. Saying "misleading children" to him, he wouldn't understand anyway. So he softened his tone and said:

"You'd better call your two sons back to farm. This book shouldn't be read."

Lu Da looked disbelievingly at this "Master Wang" whom he had always respected. In his view, Master Wang had always been a learned and kindly official. Now that he suddenly said these words, Lu Da felt a great revulsion rise within him.

The Australians taught his children to read so they wouldn't be illiterate. What was wrong with that? They provided food and clothing. Even the *xiucai* in the county didn't have this treatment.

He mumbled a few perfunctory sounds. Wang Ci knew he was unwilling in his heart. Originally, he was too lazy to waste words with him, but thinking that Lu Da was the head tenant of the school lands and many things would depend on him in the future, he patiently said:

"Lu Da! Everything taught in this book is wrong!" He wanted to explain that the characters inside were simplified and the writing wasn't very coherent, but communicating this to an illiterate was really difficult. He thought for a long time but couldn't explain it clearly.

Lu Da listened impatiently and said: "Since it's all wrong, is Master Wang willing to teach my two sons the correct knowledge?"

Wang Ci could hear the sarcasm in this and his expression changed greatly. He thought resentfully: *Truly bewitched!* Then he thought: he had no money, no people; he couldn't even raise the stipend silver for a few *xiucai*. The other side not only taught, but was willing to provide food and clothing. In comparison, he was weak and incompetent to the extreme. He felt lost and dejected.

What the common people sought was nothing more than having enough food and clothing. The Short Hairs had seized upon this point to bewitch the people. Even if he were Confucius reborn with all his learning, he could only sigh helplessly!

Thinking of this, he was utterly disheartened. Wang Ci rebuked weakly: "What do you know! Go!" He dragged his feet toward the county town.

Lu Da watched the Educational Director's hunched figure walking away and couldn't help spitting on the ground: "Easy for you to talk, standing there! Useless scholar, all that reading's gone to the dogs!"

Lu Da couldn't care less whether the knowledge his sons were learning was right or wrong. He only knew that his sons ate well and dressed warmly at the National School, learned many things, and were recently teaching everyone farming—was this knowledge fake? Reading a belly full of things that no one could understand was knowledge?

In that instant, Lu Da's long-held reverence for the *xiucai* of the county school, for Educational Director Wang, for all the scholars in the county, completely collapsed. He suddenly realized that the learned people in this world were not just these sour types who wore long gowns and spoke incomprehensibly. The Australians had another kind of knowledge, more useful than theirs.

Wang Ci staggered back to the county school. The Lingao County School of this space-time was rebuilt on the ruins of the Song and Yuan county schools in the third year of Hongwu. It was renovated in the third year of Yongle and repaired many times thereafter, but the last major renovation was in the eighth year of Chenghua—after that, the county school gradually declined.

Though declined, the old scale remained. Entering from the *Lingxing Gate*, passing through the *Halberd Gate*, one reached *Minglun Hall*. On both sides were *Jinde Study Hall* and *Xiuye Study Hall*, which were the classrooms of the county school. Behind were many supporting buildings, as well as the examination booths. In terms of scale, it ranked among the foremost on the entire island of Hainan.

The staff of the county school was also large. Just in terms of servants, there were six study hall attendants, two cooks, three gatekeepers, and three storekeepers. But this was only what was stipulated in the official records. These servant positions were all "silver duties." By the late Ming, the silver for hiring servants was levied from the servant households, but the people weren't necessarily employed. So in the grand county school, the actual servants remaining numbered only three people.
