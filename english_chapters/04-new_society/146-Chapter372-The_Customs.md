# Chapter 372 - The Customs

To facilitate cargo transport—before the rail line officially connected both locations—the Transportation Department had established ox-cart freight service between Bairren City and Bo-pu. This service had been sparked by masses of cattle arriving from Changhua Fortress. Cui Yunhong and others had shipped over fifty head in batches from Li territories.

Compared to finicky, scarce horses, cattle proved hardworking, durable, and abundant. Soon the Vehicle Factory modified four-wheeled freight wagons for two-ox teams. These slow but heavily-laden ox-carts immediately became the road transport backbone. If not for persistent wheel problems, ox-cart numbers could have increased further.

The medicines were carted to Lingao county town. Originally, Liu San had planned to transport everything to the pharmaceutical factory—convenient facilities and equipment, water and power available, plus modern processing equipment. But after the acquisition became a shareholding investment, security concerns arose. The pharmaceutical factory was a sensitive facility—bringing in a dozen indigenous workers raised safety issues.

After disembarking, Liu San telephoned Shi Niaoren about this predicament. Shi Niaoren agreed the factory wasn't suitable.

"What then—transport to the county town?"

"For now, that seems the only option," Shi Niaoren replied. "Runshitang isn't our wholly-owned enterprise. Your Shopkeeper Yang naturally has rights to enter your Chinese medicine workshop anytime, doesn't he?"

"That is a problem. But production in the county town means no water or power. Many machines won't work."

As facilities went, Runshitang was actually decent. It had dedicated warehouses for raw and processed goods with good storage conditions, plus spacious courtyards with ample processing space. Even with a dozen more employees, housing them was manageable.

"We'll have to make do. After all, Chinese patent medicines were made manually for centuries. No running water, no electricity won't matter much. For now, keep production at Runshitang. When scale increases, we'll find solutions." Shi Niaoren paused. "That day will come."

"It'll happen fast," Liu San warned. He harbored no doubt: before long, Plague-Repelling Powder and Marching Powder sales in Guangdong would surge. Hand-producing medicines in the county town wouldn't suffice then.

"Mo Xiaoan and others recently proposed something to the Executive Committee—it's likely to pass soon," Shi Niaoren said.

The proposal: within the light industrial zone outside Bairren City, designate a "Private Enterprise Park" specifically to attract private capital and technology. The transmigrator collective would provide land and complete infrastructure. If necessary, they'd offer advanced technology and management methods. Production and operations would be handled by private capital.

Under this model, they could attract merchants from Lingao, Qiongzhou, even Guangdong to invest in industry—mostly light industry without critical technology. The collective would provide technical equipment and qualified industrial workers.

"Does Lingao have that much private capital?" someone had objected at the meeting.

"Lingao may not, but the mainland does," Wen Desi, who supported the proposal, had replied. "We need to become a model of stability and prosperity. Then mainland private capital seeking safety will naturally come to invest." He thought a moment. "To put it imprecisely, we should become Ming private capital's safe harbor."

As the Ming chaos was about to unfold, many wealthy people would flee—not just the rich, but also comfortable middle-class families with useful skills or knowledge. The transmigrator collective wanted exactly these people. Attracting refugees provided labor and soldiers; attracting these people would bring wealth, technology, and knowledge.

"Sounds promising, doesn't it?" Shi Niaoren said. "Still under heated discussion. Once it passes and your scale grows, invest in the Private Enterprise Park—just build a Chinese patent medicine factory there."

So the medicines were all transported to Lingao county town. Yang Shixiang assembled Liu Benshan and the employees to announce: from today, Liu San was a shop proprietor. Everyone naturally had no objection.

That evening Liu San stayed at Runshitang—a house combining residence, shop, workshop, and warehouse. Yang Shixiang hosted a family dinner; his wife personally cooked. Around the table, wife and children were introduced to this "uncle." From now on, they were family. The household's solemnity made Liu San—who'd only seen sworn brotherhood as a business tactic—rather uncomfortable.

Liu San shared his thoughts openly. He pointed out: county town foot traffic was declining daily, and business was shrinking. They should establish a branch at East Gate Market for convenient access by market-goers.

"Brother speaks truly," Yang Shixiang nodded. "I've thought about it too. But opening a branch isn't quick—buying land, building the shop, all costs money. Pharmacy buildings aren't ordinary structures. They need high ceilings for ventilation, quality materials. Given my resources, I can't manage it quickly."

Liu San nearly said "I'll cover it," then reconsidered—having just partnered, investing more would complicate shareholding questions. He thought a moment:

"I see a way to accomplish this cheaply."

"Oh? What's brother's method?" Yang Shixiang now hung on this sworn brother's every word.

"You know I work at the Australian medical bureau."

"I'm aware," Yang Shixiang said. "I've only visited East Gate Market once since you arrived."

"The bureau plans to establish clinics throughout the county—" Liu San explained the Health Department's plans. "—The first clinic is planned for East Gate Market; the building's already ready. Our branch can be housed in this clinic."

Send two or three clerks with basic medicines; hang the signboard and business could start. Treating while selling.

"I worry the building won't be suitable?" Yang Shixiang knew the Australians' construction style—small footprints but multiple stories. Recently this trend was intensifying—someone had mentioned four-story buildings.

"Doctors upstairs, pharmacy downstairs—what's unsuitable?" Liu San replied.

"But there'd be no space for processing or decoctions..."

"Keep processing at the main shop. The branch needs only modest inventory—restock regularly. It's not far from the county town." Liu San shrugged. "Once a few shipments sell, we'll have the money, and can build a proper large shop."

Yang Shixiang agreed. They decided: the clinic entrance would display both signs. Doctors would be provided by the Australians. Runshitang would pay some monthly rent to the Health Department—payable in patent medicines.

"Once we've made some sales, there'll naturally be silver," Liu San said. "Then we'll build a proper large shop ourselves."

"I'll take brother's auspicious words."
