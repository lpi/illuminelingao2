# Chapter 452 - Autumn Levy (Part 3)

Zhou Qi was his eldest apprentice and, by all rights, his most reliable man. Yet Chen Minggang was quite stingy by nature. Zhou Qi's parents had passed away long ago, and by the customs of the old days, Chen Minggang was his closest elder, obligated not only to look after him but also to arrange his marriage.

Chen Minggang, however, had never done so. In Ming-era Lingao, the male-to-female ratio was severely unbalanced—most of the incoming migrants were single men, and women were extremely scarce. This made the cost of taking a wife much higher than on the mainland. Moreover, given Zhou Qi's status as his apprentice, he couldn't just marry any woman; it should be a daughter of a local well-to-do minor landowner or from a family in the same profession. This required a presentable bride price and building a house for the new couple.

Chen Minggang was reluctant to spend this money and had kept delaying. Before he knew it, Zhou Qi was already approaching thirty—a middle-aged bachelor by seventeenth-century standards.

This prolonged unmarried state was quite embarrassing for Zhou Qi. Moreover, it had led to another consequence: Chen Minggang was extremely fond of women, and as his senior apprentice, Zhou Qi handled many of his master's private affairs. Having frequent contact with his master's women inevitably aroused suspicion in his master—after all, this apprentice was young and robust, far superior to himself.

Lately, there had been whispers and rumors—either claiming Zhou Qi was having an affair with one of Chen Minggang's women or suggesting he harbored deep resentment behind his back. Although Chen Minggang didn't entirely believe these rumors, his trust in his apprentice had diminished. Combined with the recent Qiuhong affair, his doubts about his eldest apprentice's competence had grown considerably.

"Right, Little Hu hit the nail on the head. We absolutely need a pretext for this, to compel the major households to comply. We're just carrying out orders—they can't blame us." Chen Minggang said, "Let them be the villains."

Everyone nodded in agreement, with some even adding flattering words.

"But what pretext would work?" someone asked. "It's not easy to find one."

First, the common folk had to believe it—and these "common folk" weren't the ignorant peasants of the countryside, but landlords and gentry with property and status who wouldn't be frightened by a few empty words. Second, the Australians had to back it. Chen Minggang knew the Australians were very particular about their image and especially opposed to anyone impersonating them.

Chen Minggang remained unhurried, taking a sip of tea first. He felt that the reason he was superior to this bunch wasn't just because he held the ancestral treasure of the Fish-Scale Register, but because he could see further and more clearly than everyone else.

"You all came from the countryside. What exactly are the Australians' work teams busy with?" he suddenly asked.

Everyone chimed in with various answers. The work teams were actually doing many things in the villages, primarily conducting social surveys: population, land quantities, soil quality. They were also generally helping villages establish militias, build stockades, and even providing medical treatment and medicine.

"None of you have touched on the key point." Chen Minggang shook his head. "What the Australians care most about is figuring out Lingao's true situation!"

Everyone exchanged bewildered glances: The county's true situation?

Someone more seasoned among them figured it out: "Population, land quantities..."

"Precisely." Chen Minggang nodded. "The Australians want to stay here in Lingao for the long term. What do they need to know?" He tapped his folding fan against his palm, counting off the points. "First and foremost, they need to know how many people are in the county, how much land there is, and what the land produces."

"Land surveying?!" Umbrella-Shop Little Hu blurted out.

"Exactly!" Chen Minggang cast an appreciative glance at Little Hu. "The Australians send work teams to the countryside and contract grain levies in the county seat. At the root of it all, they simply want to find out how much Lingao is really worth." He snapped his fan open with a sharp crack and began fanning himself gently. "So let's help them out—with a land survey!"

The room erupted. "Land surveying"—the term literally meant measuring field acreage, but it went far beyond that. Concurrent with the survey, new Fish-Scale Registers would be compiled, and land ownership and tax status would be re-registered. In ancient society, this was no small matter; it typically had to be initiated by the imperial court itself. Throughout the history of the Great Ming, apart from the Hongwu reign when the first Fish-Scale Registers were compiled, the only other instance was during the early Wanli reign when Zhang Juzheng was in power. Each time a land survey was conducted, not only did the Ministry of Revenue and the province dispatch special officials to oversee it, but scholars were also drafted from across the province to assist. The process took at least half a year or more, not something that could be completed in a month or two.

Although this group "ate from the grain levy," their knowledge of conducting an actual land survey was superficial at best. They were by no means professionals, and besides, there simply wasn't enough time.

Chen Minggang gestured for them to quiet down. "What's all the fuss? This is just a pretext!" He smiled coldly. "Do you really think we're actually going to survey their land for them? Even if you all wanted to, we don't have the capability."

Everyone nodded and looked to him as their guiding light.

"The Australians want to know Lingao's true worth, so we'll just play along. Claim we're helping them survey the land—the Australians won't refuse. Once we have that pretext, won't the major households be at our mercy?"

The room burst into cheers: This plan was brilliant! Not only did it give them legitimate cover, but the Australians would definitely approve. Best of all, the major households would have nothing to say, and any consequences could be blamed on the Australians.

"Will the major households actually go along with it?" Zhou Qi asked hesitantly. "They have their own connections with the Australians."

"Having connections doesn't matter," Chen Minggang saw the relationship between the transmigrators and the gentry quite clearly. "The Australians don't like the gentry. Right now, they're just making use of them."

"A bit unexpected, isn't it?" Xiong Buyou said with a laugh as he relayed Chen Minggang's proposal in Wu De's office.

"Indeed, quite unexpected." Wu De nodded, filled with emotion. "Who would have thought Chen Minggang would see right through our intentions. The county's scholars, on the other hand, can't seem to figure anything out." There was a note of appreciation, almost kinship, in his voice.

According to Wu De's original plan, he had intended to let Chen Minggang freely impose additional tribute rice, stirring up enough complaints from the gentry and common folk. Once the county's taxes were mostly collected, he would then arrange a dramatic "petition" scene with the masses seething with righteous indignation. Finally, the transmigrators would step in as the benevolent judge, prosecute Chen Minggang and his entire gang, and thereby pacify popular anger.

After venting their frustrations, they would seize the opportunity to implement "new policies"—using the prevention of future incidents as a pretext to begin a county-wide land survey, establish a tax register, and complete tax reform.

Wu De had also prepared a backup plan. If anything unexpected happened during the grain levy that prevented the autumn taxes from being collected on time, he had already obtained the Executive Committee's approval to use an advance-payment method. The transmigrators would front the autumn grain and taxes first and then gradually recover it from future tax collections.

Regardless of which approach was used, the transmigrators were confident they could pay this year's autumn levy on time. This would allow them to survey the land and register households at a leisurely pace rather than rushing to meet the tax deadline. As the saying went, good work takes time—Wu De planned to simmer this "new tax system" slowly.

This was a major undertaking for the transmigrators, and the Executive Committee had already issued several directives to various departments, bureaus, and companies.

Leizhou Sugar Company received instructions to continue selling sugar to Vietnam while also exporting other goods needed locally, all to purchase large quantities of Vietnamese rice.

The Maritime Force received orders to concentrate shipping capacity and rush Vietnamese rice to Lingao, aiming to raise the brown rice reserves to thirty-five thousand *shi* before the eleventh lunar month.

The Foreign Trade Commission received instructions to use the Vietnamese rice to purchase silver in Leizhou's three counties, with a quota of ten thousand taels. This silver was earmarked for Lingao's "Liaodong levy." Wu De anticipated that rice prices in Lingao would drop due to the Liaodong levy collection; they could then sell rice at high prices, exchange it for silver, and then buy grain back at low prices.

The Education Department was instructed to immediately incorporate surveying, basic plane geometry calculations, and similar subjects into students' practical curriculum, preparing personnel for the comprehensive land survey.

The printing plant also received notice to immediately print large quantities of blank land deeds and property registration books.

...

"Chen Minggang really is talented," Xiong Buyou remarked.

"Unfortunately, this talent cannot be allowed to remain." Wu De couldn't help but view this "corrupt clerk" in a new light. The scholarly consensus that Ming and Qing grassroots governance was effectively "rule by clerks" seemed to be well-founded.

"How should I respond to him?" Xiong Buyou asked.

"Hint that he can proceed this way. You need to appear very interested in the land survey." Wu De decided to let Chen Minggang stir things up on this issue. It was like the modern practice of floating a harsh proposal first, letting public opinion attack it, and then quietly rolling out a slightly improved version that would be much easier for the public to accept. Wu De intended to use the same tactic.

"But under no circumstances can you explicitly approve it." Wu De gave detailed instructions. "Make sure someone is recording your conversation with him on video. Say plenty of ambiguous things. Work with the Propaganda Department first on how to phrase it—this will make editing easier later. You need to make it look like he was the one eagerly recommending the land survey to us—"

"I understand." Xiong Buyou nodded.

"Chen Minggang just wants us to be the villains while he gets rich. Originally, we could have played the villain anyway." Wu De sounded slightly regretful. "If only he were actually willing to put in the work and help us conduct a proper land survey."

"Ha ha ha ha, now you're asking a tiger for its skin." Xiong Buyou had dealt with clerks enough to understand their nature perfectly. "They're nothing but parasites on the system, only thinking about how to line their own pockets. How could they possibly have such high-minded consciousness?"

"There's one more thing. Chen Minggang asked me where the grain collection stations should be set up and how many of our people should staff each station."

"The stations will still be in the county seat," Wu De had already thought this through. "As for our people—not a single one. Let them continue as before." Wu De continued, "Since we're having them take the blame, they might as well take it completely."
