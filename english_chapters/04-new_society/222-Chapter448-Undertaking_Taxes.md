# Chapter 448 Undertaking Taxes

Wang Zhaomin poured out the problems since the levying of Liao Supplies began. In his view, the court levying silver was simply harmful with no benefit for a remote small county like Lingao. Instead, every time silver was levied, it caused turmoil and disturbed the people extremely.

"Lingao is not like Southern Zhili, nor can it compare to Henan or Hebei! Where can the common people in such places get silver to pay? It's nothing more than selling grain and cloth cheaply, fattening the merchants for nothing." Wang Zhaomin sighed.

Listening, Wu De knew this was another headache for the county. Lingao and Xuwen or Haikang across the strait were practically two extremes. On one side, due to sugar cane production, the commodity economy was developed, with expensive grain and cheap silver; here, it was almost strictly a natural economy, where silver was rarely seen in the market.

"I heard that in Xuwen across the strait, because of the abundant production of cane sugar, rice is expensive and silver is cheap. Why not transport grain to Xuwen to sell for silver?"

"How can it be that easy!" These words triggered Wang Zhaomin's bellyful of complaints again.

When Wu Mingjin first took office back then, he also had this idea and even sent family members to Xuwen to ask about market prices. But to transport grain, one needed a batch of grain on hand for turnover. This grain had no source—Lingao's annual grain tax was barely completed, and the Ever-Normal Granary had no surplus grain to adjust. Furthermore, transporting grain across the sea involved transport costs. In case the boats capsized, no one could afford the compensation. After the freshness of Magistrate Wu's new appointment passed, he finally abandoned this idea with the mindset that avoiding trouble was better than creating it.

Also needing to pay taxes, Haikang and Xuwen had it much easier than Lingao. local yamen obtained a large amount of revenue from the sugar trade links. With silver, they didn't worry about not being able to buy grain, but having grain didn't necessarily mean being able to exchange for silver. The worst part was that Lingao's agricultural level was inferior to Xuwen and Haikang, simply unable to exchange for required silver through large-scale grain exports.

For the government to complete the tax quota, they could only coerce villagers to sell their products at cheap prices. Although collecting taxes in currency played an important promoting role in disintegrating the natural economy and establishing a commodity economy, it was very destructive for places like Lingao with frequent natural disasters and low productivity levels.

Unexpectedly, separated only by a narrow Qiongzhou Strait, they were two completely different worlds. Wu De lamented the vastness of China and the complexity of its national conditions, feeling a bit of awe for the first time regarding the big hat of "Civil Affairs" on his head.

However, having talked this far, Wu De felt it was about enough. He had accepted full authority from the Executive Committee and could show his cards to Wang Zhaomin.

He opened his mouth: "Private Secretary Wang, actually, regarding the grain tax matter, you don't need to worry—"

"Much obliged!" Wang Zhaomin hurriedly thanked him.

"Wait!" Wu De said slowly. "Regarding the matter of my Australian group paying tax, I can promise here: five hundred *mu* of paddy fields, not a grain less. Not only that, for Lingao County's autumn tax this year, whether it's land tax, poll tax, or Liao Supplies, we will undertake and pay it all."

"What?!" Wang Zhaomin was dumbfounded, simply not knowing how to react. "The whole county's grain tax!" This was too unexpected for Wang Zhaomin—someone actually proposed to pay the whole county's autumn tax on behalf of others!

"The whole county's grain tax?" Wang Zhaomin asked back in disbelief.

"Exactly." Wu De nodded.

Wang Zhaomin thought *this group of Australians is too bold! Just the principal quota of grain for the whole county is nearly eight thousand shi. Plus various wastages in grain collection and transport links, even if every handler in this county is as clear as water and bright as a mirror, it would still take ten thousand shi of brown rice to manage, not to mention the more than eight thousand taels of silver for Liao Supplies.*

*The Australians were still collecting 'Reasonable Burden' in the whole county after the Spring Festival this year; how did they become so generous in the blink of an eye?*

"This year, we will be the General Tax Farmer for the whole county." Wu De said clearly, his tone allowing no doubt.

Wang Zhaomin was speechless for a moment; this was an outcome he absolutely hadn't expected. He had thought the Australians might refuse the request and not pay a single grain of rice, or perhaps ask for an exorbitant price, or maybe even ask the county yamen to collect "Reasonable Burden" on their behalf. But undertaking the whole county's taxes, this request was truly too unexpected. Even when the Gou brothers' power was at its peak, they never had such an idea.

"Really want to undertake the whole county's taxes?" Wang Zhaomin couldn't help asking again.

"Of course really." Wu De nodded and said calmly, "We always mean what we say; when have we ever broken faith with people?"

Wang Zhaomin's brain was spinning fast. Was this ultimately beneficial or harmful to him and Wu Mingjin? For a moment, he couldn't make a judgment.

However, he instinctively felt that this request concealed evil intentions.

"The dynasty's grain tax has thousands of threads and loose ends; the tricks within are extremely numerous. Moreover, that person Chen Minggang is extremely tricky and wicked..." Wang Zhaomin began to use the "posing difficulties" method.

"We know this," Wu De didn't intend to discuss specific details with him, just simply stated his side's conditions:

"How much tax should be paid, presumably Private Secretary Wang knows clearly, and wouldn't deceive us outsiders for being ignorant." Wu De's eyes stared tightly at Wang Zhaomin. "Exactly how much is the principal quota, how much is the wastage rice, and how much benefit should be in it for the yamen, you can state it all one by one; no need to be polite."

"This, no need, no need..." Wang Zhaomin was already flustered. "This matter must be discussed with my employer before a decision can be made."

"Discussion is natural. However," Wu De revealed a threatening air, "Autumn grain is a major event in county administration. I think Master Wu definitely won't fail to understand this reasoning."

This was an unmistakable direct threat: If they weren't allowed to undertake the autumn tax, don't even think about collecting Lingao's grain.

"Yes, yes, naturally understand this." Wang Zhaomin was sweating profusely.

"So, the Hair Bandits are determined to undertake the whole county's taxes?" Wu Mingjin asked with a frown.

"Exactly! East Lord. This bandit chief surnamed Wu spoke rudely, implying that if we don't let them undertake it, they will make the county's autumn grain uncollectible!"

"Old Master, what are the Hair Bandits trying to do?"

"Probably they want to take the opportunity to accumulate wealth." Wang Zhaomin thought over and over; only this possibility existed. "Only it doesn't seem like it, very suspicious."

"Exactly," Wu Mingjin nodded. "Accumulating wealth requires money and valuables. What use do they have for so much grain? Besides, it's very easy for them to get grain and money—just tell the local rich landlords to hand it over; who dares not pay? Why go to such trouble, first making a scene of undertaking taxes."

Undertaking taxes wasn't an easy job; not only troublesome but also complicated and difficult. If saying the Crossing Group wanted to get rich from this, it was a bit unreliable.

The two thought back and forth but couldn't figure out where their motive lay. Of course, they unanimously agreed the Australians "harbored no good intentions."

Regardless of intentions, Wu Mingjin didn't have many choices. Either he agreed to the Australians undertaking it; or he disagreed and waited for the Australians to cause trouble. It had to be one of the two.

The result of the choice was obvious. Wu Mingjin had to agree. Judging by the Australians' usual conduct, they had always kept promises. Saying they would undertake taxes, they absolutely wouldn't play the trick of collecting grain but not paying tax. If taxes could be collected in full on time, it was also a good thing for Wu Mingjin. At most, the Australians would raise the wastage rice and floating collection to collect a few more *shi* of grain—but that was the common people's business, irrelevant to him.

"I'm afraid the proceeds this year will be much less," Wang Zhaomin reminded his employer.

"That's also a helpless thing." Wu Mingjin sighed, though he intuitively felt it probably wouldn't be less, yet he still had to put on a helpless look. "Avoiding trouble is better than creating it. I only seek to finish this term as Magistrate peacefully. After leaving office, I'll return to my hometown immediately..."

Wang Zhaomin had no reply, so he took his leave first. He thought to himself, the East Lord said "helpless," but he still had to figure out a way to get enough benefits from this year's autumn grain for him—after all, this also directly concerned his own income. He told his concubine to brew a pot of tea and thought through the causes and consequences carefully: regardless of what evil intentions the Australians harbored in undertaking taxes, right now, it did no harm to Wu Mingjin or himself.

Grain taxes could be paid in full on time, and he wouldn't need to deal with the tricky clerks of the Revenue Section every day with their hundred tricks. As for the "wicked people" in the county, naturally, the Australians' fast guns and bayonets would deal with them. Wang Zhaomin suddenly hoped the Transmigrators would properly fix those guys who had always despised his authority in the past.

The next day, he met Wu De again, and both sides reached an agreement on this issue.

The Australians would undertake the whole county's taxes, including grain tax, land-poll tax, miscellaneous taxes, and Liao Supplies. All would be paid to the county yamen in full and on time.

"The deadline for autumn grain is the end of the eleventh month." Wang Zhaomin reminded. "However, sooner is better than later. After collection, the county still has to ship it out to complete the tax payment. Large-scale transport of money and grain involves a difficult journey, and Lingao involves crossing the sea. The time spent on the road is considerable, so it's best to pay in full by the end of the tenth month; that way it can be more relaxed."

Money and grain shipped to the capital were the responsibility of the Grand Canal troops in Southern Zhili. There were many tricks in that, as Wang Zhaomin had witnessed. Qiongzhou Prefecture had no Grand Canal transport task; the county was responsible for transport itself, inevitably dealing with transport households.

The earlier the money and grain were shipped, the cheaper the freight. As the deadline approached, transport households knew the government couldn't miss the deadline and would deliberately dawdle to extort freight fees.

"...At such times, if 'wastage rice' isn't enough, we'd have to conscript commoners to serve corvée labor to transport grain. Laboring people and wasting money is a huge abuse. Please be mindful, gentlemen!"

"Is this county's money and grain shipped to Qiongzhou Prefecture?"

"It's complicated." Wang Zhaomin said. "There are several destinations for this county's autumn tax."

Of the total 7,686 *shi* 7 *sheng* 9 *he* of autumn grain, 6,489 *shi* was Capital Warehouse Official Rice. This was the portion of autumn grain needed to be shipped out.
