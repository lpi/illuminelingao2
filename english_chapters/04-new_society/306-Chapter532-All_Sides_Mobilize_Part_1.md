# Chapter 532 - All Sides Mobilize (Part 1)

"The Executive Committee people aren't stupid—they understand. The worry is that some people will pretend not to," Yan Maoda sighed. "According to Zhang Yu and others, the comrades in Lingao are very unhappy with the past year's distribution of benefits. If someone seizes the opportunity, who knows how this will end. We need to start thinking now about how to defend ourselves—anyone who can think of Chang Shide won't fail to think of us."

"Not just defending—we need to go on the offensive by submitting a dedicated proposal! Declare the rights of overseas personnel," Zhang Xin said. "Rights must be fought for."

Leizhou, Haian Harbor.

Ever since Master Zhu the Third's mysterious death and the dissolution of the Haiyi Hall, the sugar traders on Haian Street had regrouped into the "Leizhou Sugar Industry Guild." The monopoly on Leizhou sugar sales had passed into the hands of the South China Sugar Refinery. For the transmigrated collective, this was a major boon—although the season's profits had been shaved somewhat by the high-interest capital deployed during the Sugar War.

After the victorious conclusion of that campaign, Chang Shide formally moved into the mansion that had belonged to Master Zhu the Third on Haian Street. As one of the spoils of the great victory, the mansion had been unceremoniously claimed by the South China Sugar Refinery.

Zhu An's mansion was not large, but it was elegantly and comfortably built—far nicer than the South Gate Pond area, where the South China Sugar Refinery's machinery roared day and night. Chang Shide used the pretext that, as Secretary-General of the Guild—or "Chief Steward" as it was called here—continued residence at the sugar refinery would make interaction with the sugar-trade bosses inconvenient. So he moved in with his women and Wen Qing, officially making the Zhu residence his base. As for the original storefront and offices of Zhu An's "Riyicheng" sugar firm, they were also taken over by the South China Sugar Company and given a new signboard.

Wen Tong, who had to oversee factory production, continued to live in the compound at South Gate Pond. Zhan Tianxiong, for ease of coming and going, still lived at South Gate Pond for now, though his new base at the Zou Monk Temple was under reconstruction. Once repaired, he would officially occupy that outpost.

Because Haian was a port with convenient links to Lingao, the Leizhou Station's center of gravity had gradually shifted to Haian Street. After the Lingao Construction Company sent personnel to fully renovate and remodel Zhu An's mansion, it became the Leizhou Station's official headquarters.

In the safe room deep within this compound, Chang Shide half-reclined on a wooden couch piled thick with cushions, wearing a thin silk-padded robe—seventeenth-century Leizhou was not as warm as later centuries. Across from him sat Wen Tong; Zhan Tianxiong sat in a taishi armchair nearby.

Wen Tong was dressed plainly—a thick padded gown under a simple surcoat, with a puffy cotton "six-in-one unity cap" on his head. He looked like a well-off petty merchant. Zhan Tianxiong was in short jacket and trousers, looking like a street peddler.

The three men sat in the safe room studying a secret letter sent from Lingao. Xuwen and Lingao were separated by only a strait; precisely because of the short distance, the Executive Committee had not issued a radio to the Leizhou Station. Communication was by courier. When the strait was calm, a courier departing in the morning could reach Lingao by afternoon; in summer, when days were long, he might even return before dark. Sometimes, communication with Guangzhou was also handled by sending someone to Lingao to relay by telegraph.

The letter was an official notice from the caretaker cabinet. Its contents matched what the Guangzhou Station had received. The three naturally knew everything happening in Lingao.

Wen Tong and Zhan Tianxiong knew that returning now, Chang Shide would likely face a storm. They urged him not to attend the Assembly—after all, leaving someone behind at an overseas station was perfectly normal. If he went back, he would probably be subjected to a concentrated attack; if things went badly, his overseas posting could be revoked—a heavy blow to local operations that had just gotten on track.

"A few women—what's that worth?" Chang Shide said. "Enough to scare me? I'd like to see what sort of ox gall and dog treasures these loudmouths have to show off."

"Old Chang, I know you're not afraid, but this is clearly a setup—someone's planning to make an example of you," Zhan Tianxiong said. "You can't let your guard down."

"Exactly. Everyone's in an uproar over women right now, and you—possessing five women—are way too negative a symbol. Go back and you'll definitely be mobbed by the shut-ins. You won't be able to explain your way out of it."

"Old Wen! When did I ever possess five women? Cough, cough, truly—rumors are deadly," Chang Shide complained. "Didn't A'Zhu go to you? And there's A'Luo—she's with me, sure, but she's young; I'm planning to cultivate her properly before using her…"

"Go explain the truth to the masses whose only nightly companion is Miss Five Fingers," Wen Tong said. "Old Chang, just imagining it makes me uneasy for you." In Wen Tong's imagination, the moment Chang Shide returned to Lingao, he would be fitted with a tall hat and a placard by the enraged masses and paraded all the way to the Executive Committee compound for a struggle session, with people shouting "Down with him!" beside him—an image drawn from his father's stories of Cultural Revolution struggle sessions against their sugar-factory leaders.

"It doesn't matter," Chang Shide said. "Hiding here in Xuwen solves nothing. If I don't go back and explain myself, a single transfer order from the second caretaker cabinet will have me heading meekly back to Lingao for discipline anyway. Going back now means at least I can communicate with the Committee members. For overseas personnel like us, the woman issue isn't just physiological."

"The Executive Committee has resigned en masse. The caretaker cabinet has thirty days at most. What's the point of talking to them?" Wen Tong shook his head.

Zhan Tianxiong said, "The personnel of the Second Executive Committee won't change much. The ruling group will basically be the same people. But—" he said with some concern, "I'm afraid certain Committee members are planning to use you as a scapegoat to appease the masses' anger."

"Am I, Chang Shide, the sort of man anyone can use as a scapegoat?" Chang Shide was brimming with confidence. "Any turtle-spawn who dares think along those lines—hmph—I'm one of the masses too."

Just as they were talking, a bell chimed inside the room—someone outside was looking for Chang Shide. As in other safe houses, indigenous people were not permitted to enter.

Chang Shide stepped out briefly and returned with a letter. It was from Guangzhou—a pigeon dispatch. This was rare; pigeon messages were used only in emergencies.

"Something happening in Guangzhou?" Zhan Tianxiong asked with concern.

"Not sure." Chang Shide broke the wax seal on the message tube, pulled out a small scroll, and unrolled it. The letter was in code. Translated, the content was simple—but the three men's expressions changed after reading it. Wen Tong said, "Guangzhou has it exactly right! In matters like this, we can only fight for ourselves!"

Zhan Tianxiong nodded repeatedly. "Exactly. The people in Lingao don't understand the social environment we overseas personnel operate in. They think all this is corrupt indulgence, not realizing it's also a form of cover!"

Chang Shide grew even more animated. "It seems only comrades in the same trench can truly understand each other's difficulties." He waved his hand. "We need to submit a proposal too! Let the shut-ins in Lingao know how hard overseas work really is!"

Outside Bairen Fortress, the Army Training Cadre garrison.

In one conference room, lights blazed, but the curtains were drawn tight—and not just the curtains; even the wooden shutters outside, used for typhoon protection, were closed.

Around the long conference table in the center of the room, six or seven young officers had gathered. They wore identical Army uniforms; each had a Sam Browne belt buckled on, spine ramrod-straight, doing their utmost to project a soldierly bearing.

On the table, rum bottles and glasses lay scattered. Wei Aiwen, Zhang Bolin, and the rest were holding a meeting here.

"Comrades!" Zhang Bolin's voice was low and forceful. "The thirteenth meeting of the Young Officers' Club will now begin! All rise to sing 'The Young Officer's Song'!"

A chorus of off-key male voices broke into the "Young Officer's Song"—a rewording of the "Panzer March." The lyrics were somewhat awkward and did not rhyme well; the singing was inevitably ragged. But they only wanted the spirit of the thing.

After the song, Zhang Bolin spoke solemnly: "Comrades, our Young Officers' Club has now been in existence for exactly one year. Over this year, the transmigrated collective has achieved tremendous results—inseparable from the selfless combat of all of us in the Army!" He swept his gaze across those present. "Now the transmigrated collective is about to reach a turning point and new beginning. The Army is the most reliable and solid foundation of the collective, and our Young Officers' Club must play the role of mainstay—ready at all times to defend the transmigrator regime, to defend the transmigration cause, and to permit no one to sabotage it!"

Everyone rose together and shouted "Long live!" while stamping their boots on the floor three times.

"Next, Wei Aiwen will speak!"

Wei Aiwen stood, adjusted his Sam Browne belt, then marched to the podium in steps measuring a full eighty centimeters, brimming with Germanic martial spirit. Once on the platform, he clicked his heels in salute before getting down to business.

The Young Officers' Club was a small faction composed of young Army officers, all of them youths. Their common trait was a fanatical admiration for the German military and unquestioning reverence for the Third Reich's military system.

Within the transmigrated collective's Army, the transmigrator officers clearly divided into two streams. One comprised former PLA or paramilitary veterans like He Ming and Ying Yu. The other consisted of so-called "civilian officers"—Wei Aiwen and his ilk—most of whom had been military enthusiasts in another timeline who had never actually served. Of these two streams, the veterans, possessing professional expertise, were valued more highly and occupied key positions. The civilian officers, apart from passion and heads full of military theory, had mostly never even touched a gun; they were not taken very seriously within the Army.
