# Chapter 299: Sweet Port Turbulence — Persuasion

The door was open. Looking in through the door, one could see many sedan chairs parked in the courtyard. The sound of shuffling cards and shaking dice came faintly from the hall; obviously, gambling was gathering there. Many vendors selling cooked food extended from outside the door to inside; it seemed there were some in the second courtyard too. The people entering and leaving were a mix of all kinds, dragons and snakes mingling together.

"Gambling is open here?" Chen Tianxiong was a bit surprised.

"Correct. Aunt Ai's lover is the head of the criminal division in the county. The benefits are numerous."

Xiao Zhanfeng said that the kickbacks this gambling house paid to several masters in the county every year amounted to around ten thousand, so no one ever questioned it.

Looking in through the door, there were several gambling tables inside. Chen Tianxiong asked, "Can anyone go in?"

"Yes, yes. The first courtyard allows free entry and exit, and you can gamble as you please. The stakes aren't big. Regulars go to the back, but someone needs to introduce them."

So they went in to take a look. There were Pai Gow and Fantan. Chen Tianxiong followed local customs and aimed to observe the environment, not to play. Zhou Shizhai didn't need mentioning; gambling was a big taboo for escorts. They circled around like this. Xiao Zhanfeng whispered, "He is usually inside the second gate."

"How to get in?"

"Need a regular to introduce."

"Will you introduce us in?"

"What kind of regular am I?" Xiao Zhanfeng smirked. "Follow me, let's go out first."

Coming out the door, they entered a small path on the side. Xiao Zhanfeng knocked on a door a few times. A middle-aged woman came out from inside. She had rough hands and big feet and seemed quite familiar with Xiao Zhanfeng. She said a few words with a smile. Xiao Zhanfeng said, "This is my relative, Aunt Liu."

It wasn't known what kind of distant relative this Aunt Liu counted as. Usually, when Xiao Zhanfeng couldn't make ends meet and had difficulty continuing his three meals, he would sneak here to mooch free meals. Fortunately, people lingered here day and night, so there was always fire on the stove, and meals and snacks were endless. So as long as someone was willing to take care of him, getting a free meal to fill his stomach was never a problem.

Xiao Zhanfeng spoke a few sentences in local dialect with his aunt, then turned back and said, "You guys come in first. The one surnamed Lin fooled around with Little Jinxiu until midnight last night and hasn't got up yet." Saying this, he spat with extreme contempt. "I'll eat something to fill up first."

It turned out he hadn't eaten breakfast himself and planned to come here to mooch a meal.

"How much longer?"

"It should be soon; face washing water was just sent in. We'll go to the hall to wait for him in a while." Xiao Zhanfeng said, leading them to a secluded place in the servants' quarters. After a while, Aunt Liu brought a steamer basket full of various dim sum, both sweet and salty. They were probably leftover pieces from guests, steamed together to heat up.

"You two want some?" Xiao Zhanfeng said, grabbing a broken flaky bun and stuffing it into his mouth. Swallowing too fast, he choked a bit. Aunt Liu quickly brought him a bowl of tea water. He gulped it down clean, then scooped up a shrimp dumpling and swallowed it.

"No, we both ate early in the morning." Chen Tianxiong thought this scholar didn't have any taboos eating leftovers from a brothel at all.

Xiao Zhanfeng guessed what they were thinking, and mumbled while eating, "You must be laughing at me, a scholar, actually reduced to the point of begging for food at a brothel."

Chen Tianxiong just wanted to say something, desperately searching his stomach for examples of heroes down on their luck. Just as he thought of the allusion of Han Xin suffering the humiliation under the hips, Xiao Zhanfeng gave a bitter smile: "When a person is poor, ambition is short; when a horse is thin, hair is long. When a person is down and out, it's good enough to have a mouthful of rice to eat; what dignity is there to speak of?" After speaking, he shook his head.

There were quite a few complaints in his words. Dissatisfaction with personal encounters leading to dissatisfaction with society; this was even better.

Here, waiting for him to finish "breakfast," Aunt Liu led them quietly through the woodshed. They arrived beside a moon gate.

"Gentlemen, entering here is inside the second gate." Xiao Zhanfeng whispered. "After you go in, just look and don't speak. It's the custom here not to inquire about other people's affairs. When Lin Zhuang comes out, we'll go up directly to talk to him."

Naturally, there was no objection to this. Immediately, the two were led by Xiao Zhanfeng, swaggering through the moon gate and arriving at a large hall.

It was livelier here than outside. The games played were similar to outside, but no cash was seen on the tables. They were all exquisite ivory chips. Chen Tianxiong had good eyesight and saw various characters carved with fine work on them, nothing more than Heaven, Earth, Man, etc. Probably codes.

Chen Tianxiong whispered, "There are many people and mixed eyes here. Showing our faces here, if Haiyi Hall finds out, it will be hard to handle."

"You relax," Xiao Zhanfeng was very certain. "This is the county seat, not Haian Street. It's not their turn to dictate. That group of sugar dogs never comes here either."

"That's good." Chen Tianxiong was still looking around, when Xiao Zhanfeng whispered, "Don't look around everywhere; this is the biggest taboo here. Follow me."

Xiao Zhanfeng knew Lin Zhuang liked to bet on "Fantan" the most, so he pulled Chen Tianxiong to stand quietly behind a Fantan table, watching across the clusters of heads, waiting for Lin Zhuang to come out to gamble.

Because the person hadn't come out yet, Chen Tianxiong focused his attention on the gambling table. He had rich social experience and had mixed in various casinos, but he had never seen this kind of gambling.

The table was specially used for shaking the *Tan*. The hard wood tabletop was a size larger than an ordinary square table. The four corners were inlaid with marble to mark boundaries, and each side had a marble inlay the size of a teacup as a dot. The banker was one dot, opposite door three dots, right side two, left side four; Left Green Dragon, Right White Tiger.

The banker used a shaking jar for the dice. Shaking it three times, opening the shaking jar to see the number, each number had a different explanation. The spectating gamblers placed bets on each door on the table according to their choices and gambling methods. Chen Tianxiong watched extremely attentively and realized that the betting variations in this *Tan*-shaking gambling method were many, and the ins and outs were huge—he gradually made out the value of the ivory chips. A Heaven character chip was one hundred *liang*, Earth character fifty, Man character ten *liang*, and plain face probably one *liang*. The betting capital on this table alone was nearly five thousand *liang*. This was just a small Xuwen County seat! The wealth brought here by the sugar industry was indeed beyond imagination.

The banker's hand was quite lucky, sweeping away the losers. Waves came and went like the Yangtze River pushing the front waves, pushing Chen Tianxiong from the back to the front, changing from standing to sitting. In order not to attract attention, Chen Tianxiong also bought small chips worth ten *liang* of silver and placed bets randomly, planning to retreat to the back and wait again after losing them all.

Unexpectedly, after a few rounds, his random betting actually won a lot of money. In a blink of an eye, the chips in front of him piled up. After finishing the first half of the banker's term, a rough estimate showed he had actually won over a hundred *liang* of silver.

Shaking *Tan* had so-called "paths," which were each person's betting routine. There were many names for *Tan* paths: Big Path, Small Path, Meat Path, Vegetable Path. This set of things sounded logical and very fastidious, but actually everyone believed their own. Someone like Chen Tianxiong who bet randomly without a path and kept winning money had never been seen in the casino. This immediately made the whole venue look sideways. Because Chen Tianxiong was a stranger, and seeing his composed bearing and extremely casual and free style when placing bets, they felt this person was even more mysterious and unfathomable, thus increasing their curiosity.

Under the gaze of dozens of eyes, his luck actually didn't diminish in the second half of the banker's term. Although there were losses, the winning side was still greater than the losing side. By the end of this term, Chen Tianxiong had netted more than two hundred *liang*. The surprise, envy, anger, and annoyance of the people at the same table gathered on him, displaying all kinds of attitudes.

Chen Tianxiong himself couldn't help but smile. The "Treasure Officer" (Croupier) wanted to win over the gambler and also expressed admiration to join the fun, instructing the payout on the "Green Dragon Corner" to exempt his "Head Money". Chen Tianxiong remained impassive, only stood up slowly, cupped his hands and said, "Fluke!"

The head money was not short a single coin, still thrown onto the "Green Dragon Corner." This move was quite beautiful, giving the casino enough face.

But there was no need to gamble further. He, Chen Tianxiong, came to find Lin Zhuang, not to gamble, and certainly not prepared to mix in the underworld in Xuwen. Seeing that almost an hour had passed and Lin Zhuang still hadn't shown up, he couldn't help but feel a little anxious.

Xiao Zhanfeng was very excited and whispered, "Shopkeeper Chen, I didn't expect that move of yours to be really beautiful!"

"Where is Lin Zhuang? Why hasn't he come yet?"

"He's already here, but seeing your luck was booming, I didn't dare disturb..."

Chen Tianxiong didn't know whether to laugh or cry. Xiao Zhanfeng signaled with his eyes: that is Lin Zhuang.

He saw sitting beside the Fantan table a man about thirty years old, with rough hands and feet, and many scars left by burns on his hands. He looked like a typical laborer, but his face was grayish and sullen, his spirit heavy, and his eyes vacuous. Chen Tianxiong was knowledgeable and knew this was the look after excessive wine and sex.

Seeing that although he sat by the table, there were few chips at hand. At this moment, the Treasure Officer revealed a "Four," causing all three doors to miss, and seeing the chips being collected by the payout officer, he couldn't help sighing. When it was time to shake the treasure again, he didn't bet on any door, hesitating while pinching a few chips.

"Old Lin! Why don't you place a bet?" The banker asked. "Ideally going to shake!"

"If you cherish a few coins, then go down! Your luck isn't smooth right now." Someone advised.

"Use a few less on Little Jinxiu yesterday, wouldn't you have it today?"

Lin Zhuang looked blankly for a long time, but still couldn't make up his mind. If these last few *liang* of silver were thrown down and lost again, he would be penniless. Aunt Ai's place, although not a *yamen*, was also "don't enter without money." Even if he was reluctant to leave—especially reluctant to part with Little Jinxiu's charming appearance (more than half of the silver received from Master Zhu had been filled into her)—he would still be swept out the door immediately.

He had the heart to gamble one more time, but the hundreds of people in front of the Zou Monk Temple were going to run out of food today. No silver meant no rice. To ask Master Zhu for money again, he would have to wait until at least the burning of incense and swearing of oaths, to let him hear a noise first. Lin Zhuang knew that those workers had long been dissatisfied with him. If no rice was sent this time, he was afraid the matter of burning incense would fall through.

After thinking for a long time, he stood up to yield his seat. He shrank to the side alone and ordered a pot of tea. He didn't have much money on hand, so naturally he wasn't willing to give tips. The people in the hall turned their faces extremely fast; it took a long time to bring a pot of tea, and it was cold.

"Truly whores are heartless." Lin Zhuang muttered alone in a low voice, calculating how to talk to the workers when he went back, to let them make a bigger commotion when burning incense tomorrow, so he could ask Master Zhu for another sum of silver.

Just as he was calculating, suddenly someone patted his shoulder, and someone called, "Master Lin!"

How would Lin Zhuang know someone was tailing him? Hearing the voice, he turned his face to look and saw Zhou Shizhai watching him with a smile, asking, "Were you calling me?"

"Yes! Aren't you Master Lin Zhuang?"

"Yes, it's me," his eyes rolled around on Zhou Shizhai, seeming to be trying hard to search his memory for such a person.

Seeing that this person was dressed neither expensively nor cheaply, had a dignified bearing, and behaved with style, knowing he was not someone to be trifled with, he asked very politely, "Does brother have business with me?"

"My master wants to make a friend with you." Zhou Shizhai was full of smiles.

"Who is your master? Could it be mistaken..."

"Absolutely no mistake," Zhou Shizhai lowered his voice. "My master is in the Warm Pavilion. Please move your esteemed steps a few paces; he has words to say to you."

Lin Zhuang suddenly became alert. He had mixed with all kinds of people for a long time and knew somewhat about the weirdness within. Recently he followed Master Zhu to deal with the South China Sugar Factory, and this sugar factory's financial power was not small. When immortals fight, the common people suffer. If South China found someone to deal with him, he really wouldn't have time to cry for help, and no one would listen! This was not Haian Street; Haiyi Hall carried no weight here. Moreover, Aunt Ai's place was a place where "black eyeballs only recognize white silver." If the other party's silver arrived, he would become a "roadside corpse" on the street in the middle of the night today!

He reacted quite fast and busily declined, "I appreciate your master's kindness, but I have some miscellaneous matters to handle immediately. I will come to visit immediately after finishing..."

Before he finished speaking, one of Zhou Shizhai's hands had already grasped his wrist.

"Master Lin, better please come now, my master is very busy!" Zhou Shizhai was full of smiles, but his eyes were cold.

Lin Zhuang was greatly shocked. Just as he wanted to struggle, a sharp pain came from his wrist, and half his body went numb.

"Please!"

Lin Zhuang was forced into the Warm Pavilion like this. Chen Tianxiong, concerned that Xiao Zhanfeng was a local resident and it was inconvenient to show his face, let him wait in the next room. He himself sat with his back to the light, so Lin Zhuang couldn't see his face, but he could see the other's face clearly.

"This is our Master Chen." Zhou Shizhai "escorted" him in and introduced.

Lin Zhuang counted as half a *Jianghu* person after all. Knowing the situation was bad, and that politeness offended no one, he quickly knelt down and kowtowed.

"Get up." Chen Tianxiong said in a deep voice.

"Yes, thank you Master Chen." Lin Zhuang stood up and stood carefully to the side. Seeing the man who escorted him in guarding the door, he cried bitterness in his heart, thinking that he would probably suffer today.

Chen Tianxiong said straightforwardly, "I was entrusted by the proprietor of South China to come and say a few words to you! The matter between Haiyi Hall and South China Factory, bridges are bridges, roads are roads; originally it has nothing to do with you sugar shed workers. I advise you to do less meaningless things. Avoid hurting harmony!"

"Dare not, dare not." Hearing it was indeed someone from South China, Lin Zhuang's legs immediately went soft, and he knelt paralyzed on the ground kowtowing repeatedly. His involvement in Master Zhu's affairs was known to everyone in Xuwen. The opponent might not dare to move against Master Zhu, but crushing him, a small fire-burning worker, was as easy as lifting a hand. How did he know if they were going to use him as the "chicken" to warn the monkeys?
