# Chapter 383 - Fu Buer Joins the Society

"Finally cleared every hurdle." Watching the rice ears swaying with harvest imminent, Wu Nanhai breathed a sigh of relief. Looking toward the vigorous high-yield field construction at Meitai Yang in the distance, his heart was content.

Though the first early-rice crop had been bumpy with yields below expectations, it had accumulated sufficient experience. Many practical problems now had solutions. He estimated that at current construction speed, planting those 1,500 *mu* of new high-yield fields would have to wait until August—still in time for late-season planting.

Of course, achieving modern-era yields of 2,000 *jin* per *mu* was impossible. He estimated test field yields around 800 *jin* per *mu*. In Lingao, this would be miraculous.

As for rain-dependent fields, performance was poor—generally only 300-400 *jin*. Wu Nanhai discovered that without sufficient agricultural inputs and field management, hybrid rice performed only marginally better than ordinary lodging-resistant varieties. Hybrid rice on rain-dependent fields yielded only 50-100 *jin* more per *mu* than other varieties—not much difference.

Still, this plus April's sweet potato harvest had astonished all Lingao County. Landlords everywhere were inquiring: what seeds did the Australians use? Farm workers had suddenly become hot commodities—recognized on the road, they'd be dragged off for drinks to extract information. Several rich peasants and small landlords even offered to marry daughters to them if they'd switch employers. As for various schemes to ingratiate themselves with farm personnel to obtain seeds at harvest—these were commonplace.

Wu Nanhai wasn't concerned. Hybrid rice seed-saving was meaningless; sweet potatoes accumulated toxins. Without the Agricultural Committee's technical support system, such miracles wouldn't recur. But for appearances, he held several assemblies announcing strict prohibition of seed leakage—anyone caught would be "sent to the labor reform camp."

"Labor reform camp" now made indigenous laborers in Lingao tremble. Camp commander Fu Youdi's reputation rivaled Himmler's. To strengthen laborers' law-abiding consciousness, Wu De periodically organized indigenous workers to visit the camp, fully appreciating how fortunate it was to work honestly for the transmigrator collective.

Some who felt they had connections with the collective—like Zhang Youfu, who'd facilitated peace negotiations between the county government and transmigrators last year—occasionally visited Wu De, hinting they wanted new seeds. That Fu Buer, once captured and later made Meiyang Village representative who'd heard about the cropped-heads' new miracle—yields of seven or eight hundred *jin* from one rice crop—could sit still no longer. He rushed to East Gate Market to find Ma Peng, hoping Ma Peng would introduce him to important farm figures. "Spending some silver is fine," he said.

But Ma Peng told him there was no rush: "The leaders are recently setting up something called 'Heaven and Earth Society'—specifically to help everyone farm. If you want to learn their methods, just register at the Heaven and Earth Society office at East Gate Market."

"Heaven and Earth Society?" Fu Buer was puzzled.

"Heaven and Earth Society." Ma Peng said. "Heaven above, earth below—Heaven and Earth Society."

Fu Buer hurried to East Gate Market. A new two-story building had risen near the outer perimeter of East Gate Street. Before it stood an incongruously placed wooden arch inscribed with "Heaven and Earth Society" in large characters. Flanking couplets read: "Earth shakes the high ridge, a stream flows on for a thousand ages; Gate faces the great sea, three rivers flow for ten thousand years."

Fu Buer gathered his courage and entered. The receptionist, hearing his request, produced a form for registration. Though somewhat literate, Fu Buer was semi-illiterate and had to ask them to write for him. The registration covered only name, address, family members—then asked how much land he had? How much paddy and dry field respectively?

Fu Buer was about to answer, then swallowed his words. After thinking, he said his family had only fifty *mu* of paddy—actually they had over 400 *mu*: 300 *mu* paddy, over 100 *mu* dry field. He said this because it suddenly occurred to him: who knew what these cropped-heads intended with this so-called "Heaven and Earth Society"? Centuries of farmer wisdom accumulated from government and elite deception made Fu Buer immediately set an ambush.

After registration, the clerk gave him a bamboo token with an engraved number. He was told: on the first of next month, bring the token to the Heaven and Earth Society office for a group meeting chaired by Society President Ye Yuming.

Fu Buer was confused: "Isn't this for buying seeds?"

The clerk smiled: "It's not that simple. You'll meet first. President Ye will explain specifics at the meeting."

Fu Buer suddenly grew nervous: "Um, may I ask—does the Heaven and Earth Society charge fees..."

"Fees?" The clerk checked his registration. "You have only fifty *mu* of paddy—that makes you a middle peasant. Probably no charge. Only large landowners pay—they pay technical service fees." The clerk consulted some papers. "Charged per *mu*."

Thank goodness! Fu Buer secretly rejoiced. Sure enough, nothing in this world was free. Fees were required! Fortunate he'd reported only fifty *mu*—otherwise wouldn't he needlessly pay extra grain tax? Officials everywhere were equally black! But the cropped-heads apparently did favor small households. He'd likely get free seeds.

Fu Buer left the Heaven and Earth Society office secretly pleased, calculating: once fifty *mu* of seeds arrived, not a single grain to tenants—he'd personally supervise long-term workers planting them. Then keep the best for seed-saving; next year all his paddies could be planted.

"The Heaven and Earth Society president is no longer Chen Bachi," Ye Yuming secretly self-satisfied. "Ye Bachi" didn't sound quite right anyway...

He now stood in a second-floor meeting room at the Heaven and Earth Society. The freshly whitewashed walls were still slightly damp; black paint on the wooden board serving as blackboard wasn't fully dry. This would be the venue for future promotional meetings with Heaven and Earth Society clients. Training would be conducted at the farm—learning through practice.

The meeting room had gathered personnel from the Agricultural Committee, Civil Affairs Committee, and related departments, preparing to hold the first "Agricultural Work Conference" to discuss Heaven and Earth Society implementation methods.

Everyone agreed on using the Heaven and Earth Society as the external organization for agricultural technology promotion. Many local farmers and landlords had already shown demand for new agricultural methods.

Originally, Ye Yuming's Heaven and Earth Society plan only involved small poultry loans for contract farming, plus simple agricultural technical training for local farmers. After several days of discussion, the plan had been greatly expanded.

The new Heaven and Earth Society would have two departments: "Heaven Department" for technology, "Earth Department" for promotion.

Promoted improved varieties and agricultural techniques were divided into two client groups by target:

First were landlords—standard being those with over 100 *mu* of directly managed land, cultivated personally or using hired workers. Also called "entrepreneurial landlords."

Agricultural technology promotion mainly targeted them. The model: Heaven and Earth Society provides seeds and trains field management personnel. First year, the Agricultural Department dispatches Heaven Department staff to assist purchasing landlords with field management while training their own personnel. Technical services for grain households would require patent fees, bundled with seeds. Charging was to cultivate early intellectual property awareness.

Thereafter, these clients must pay annual membership dues. Correspondingly, the Heaven and Earth Society would continue providing improved seeds and basic services: crop disease and pest control, technical guidance, supplying pesticides and fertilizers.

"Wait!" Ye Yuming suddenly asked. "Fertilizer's manageable—lignite and such, plus synthetic ammonia industry. But pesticides? Doesn't that require organic chemistry industry?"

"Traditional pesticides." Wu Nanhai had accumulated considerable experience with folk pesticides during the early crop—his confidence was greater now. "This early rice crop succeeded largely thanks to traditional pesticides. They're not as effective as modern ones, certainly."

"Bordeaux mixture? Copper sulfate plus lime water? How effective? I remember it's for spraying fruit trees—can it work on rice?" Ye Yuming recalled high school biology lessons.

"Bordeaux mixture is a protectant—effective if sprayed before disease appears, lasting two weeks. Very effective against downy mildew, less so against rust. Early inorganic pesticides also include lime-sulfur mixture—quite effective, a fungicide, especially against rust and powdery mildew, with lasting effect, plus some insect prevention." Wu Nanhai had mastered these materials dug from old records. "Rice insect pests can be controlled with 'Yellow-Mouth Soil 666'—basically Chinese medicinal materials plus simple inorganic compounds, effective against rice aphids. There should be many such formulas."

Enthusiastically: "I plan to propose to the Executive Committee: the Agricultural Committee should establish a pesticide factory, plus a crude fertilizer factory. These two items alone would be agricultural super-weapons in the Great Ming. Besides our own use, we can sell commercially—they'll be in hot demand!"

Wan Lihui said: "External sales won't be highly profitable. Volume and weight are too large—profit per unit weight too low."

"No matter." Wu Nanhai explained. "First year, use Heaven and Earth Society to bring fertilizer and pesticides to the countryside. Besides supplying Society members, we can provide free use to Green Zone and Blue Zone villages. Second year, we can sell countywide. Let farmers haul it themselves. Volume and weight aren't problems—these things cost little. Folk pesticides' costs are basically labor costs—raw materials are worthless stuff."

"But, Committee Member Wu, I don't understand why the charter proposes targeting only 'entrepreneurial landlords.' Aren't landlords all landlords?" Wan Lihui was puzzled.
