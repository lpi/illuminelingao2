# Chapter 490 - The Audit Committee

"Exactly." Wu De nodded. "When interests are at stake, neither conscience nor faith can be relied upon."

From grain collection to land surveying, the Civil Affairs Department's demand for grassroots administrative personnel had greatly increased. Now, with the added responsibility of disaster relief involving more and more areas, Wu De and the few transmigrators under him could no longer oversee everything personally. This worried him greatly.

"But we do political security work, not anti-corruption—" Ran Yao thought that anti-corruption had never been a police matter; it belonged to the Discipline Inspection Commission. However, no one in the transmigrator group had ever worked in a supervision bureau or a discipline inspection commission.

"Everything has a beginning," Wu De said. "Since there isn't such an agency, why don't you form one?"

"It would be more appropriate for you to submit the report." Ran Yao hesitated. Establishing a specialized agency wasn't difficult—anti-corruption could arguably fall under the jurisdiction of internal affairs. But in the current situation, anti-corruption work was much more complex than political security: the person in charge needed to know the administrative system inside out to identify loopholes; they needed to understand finance and accounting to avoid being fooled by cooked books; and anti-corruption couldn't just target natives. History proved that the most formidable corrupt elements always had backers in the center, which meant anti-corruption activities had to be conducted within the transmigrator group as well. Therefore, this person had to be impartial and firm in their stance...

finding such a person was difficult. And even if found, placing this agency under the Interior Department would be unwise—he already held too much power. Ran Yao thought it would be better to set up this agency independently.

"I'm not familiar with running secret agencies."

"It's not a secret agency. It has investigative components, but it's completely different from Political Security," Ran Yao said. "It would be better for the Executive Committee to control such an agency directly. Anti-corruption work will inevitably involve transmigrators in the future."

"You're right." Wu De thought that was indeed the case. If it didn't have the support of the highest authority, the value of such an agency would be quite limited.

Wu De drafted the wording and wrote a report requesting the establishment of an Independent Commission Against Corruption.

The direct result of this report was the Executive Committee's announcement of the establishment of a Special Audit Committee. Cheng Dong of the Finance Committee had also submitted a report requesting the establishment of an Audit Bureau responsible for auditing and supervising the materials and financial status of the entire group, stating the matter was urgent.

In the spirit of saving manpower for the revolution and minimizing bureaucratic institutions, the Executive Committee decided to combine the two reports and establish a department that managed both integrity and auditing. Thus, the word "Special" was added to the Audit Committee's title.

Yi Fan was appointed as the first director. He was not only an accountant but also a professional auditor. It was a perfect match for his expertise. His appointment was strongly pushed by the Finance Committee. In their view, the transmigrator group's current financial system was full of loopholes and simply a hotbed for corruption; it had to be guarded by a professional auditor. Having a professional auditor take this position was appropriate.

"Is this person suitable?" Wu De looked at the fat man sitting solemnly behind the conference table. He looked like a petty clerk no matter how you looked at him. His auditing skills were probably fine, but for this position, did he lack the necessary capability?

"Should be no problem," Ran Yao whispered. "Yi Fan is a totalitarian..."

"Understood." Wu De nodded. Totalitarians generally didn't recognize family relations and would stop at nothing to maintain the system. He was very suitable for this job.

Sure enough, his subsequent speech revealed strong totalitarian tendencies. First, he wanted to change the name of the Special Audit Committee to the "Special Audit Committee for Eliminating Corruption and Sabotage," abbreviated as "Cheka."

"See, here it comes, right?" Ran Yao chuckled softly. "These people are a bit like Germanophiles. Germanophiles get excited hearing about Iron Crosses, tanks, and 88mm guns. These guys get ecstatic hearing KGB, Gestapo, and Cheka."

Everyone looked at each other. Finally, someone pointed out: Even in Russian, the abbreviation for the Special Audit Committee for Eliminating Corruption and Sabotage wasn't Cheka. Wasn't this naked plagiarism a bit too much?

"Not at all." Yi Fan looked radiant. "Anti-corruption is a long-term task, a combination of public activity and secret investigation." He took out a lens cloth and cleaned his glasses unhurriedly. "Gentlemen, you probably understand that the key to anti-corruption is prevention, not arresting people afterwards. Arresting more people, handling more major cases, or even dragging a member of the Executive Committee out to be shot to show our anti-corruption resolve is meaningless—the evil fruit of corruption has already been produced."

"This kid is ruthless. Wants to shoot Executive Committee members right off the bat," Cheng Dong, the People's Commissar for Finance, laughed.

"Maybe he really plans to," some people thought silently to themselves.

"...Therefore, the committee must have a powerful deterrent effect. To deter crime, there must be a resonant name, so that corrupt elements will tremble at the mere sound of this word."

"The name doesn't matter," Wen Desi said slowly. "You can call it Cheka or Gestapo if you like. What do you plan to do?"

Yi Fan smiled cunningly. "That depends on how much power the Executive Committee grants me."

In the end, he got the power he needed. This freshly baked 17th-century Cheka, in addition to controlling the power of financial and material auditing, was authorized to enter any department under the Executive Committee at any time to inspect and seize account books, financial records, and material vouchers; it had the authority to suspend any department's material applications and usage at any time; freeze departmental and personal accounts and assets; and summon people for questioning at any time—for no longer than 72 hours. This summoning power was limited to native personnel; summoning transmigrators required Executive Committee approval.

To ensure this committee had strong executive power, the Special Audit Committee for Eliminating Corruption and Sabotage was professionally guided by the Finance Committee but directly responsible to the Executive Committee.

Yi Fan's department quickly threw itself into active work. In a surprise inspection of the refugee camp, he immediately audited an error in the amount of rice put in for each meal at the refugee camp outside the county seat. He calculated very precisely how much brown rice was needed to feed these refugees, but the current daily rice consumption was 7.4% higher than this figure.

Consequently, the staff responsible for cooking and distributing brown rice at the refugee camp were immediately summoned for questioning. Within 24 hours, a small gang embezzling rice used for daily porridge was dug out, involving four people. The amount involved was three *shi* of rice.

Wu De immediately convened a public trial at the refugee camp, attended by refugees and Civil Affairs Committee staff. Subsequently, these four unlucky guys were sentenced to six months of labor reform—"to warn others."

The effect of making an example was very powerful. In several subsequent surprise inspections, a number of waste incidents caused by negligence were discovered, but no more embezzlement cases occurred. In fact, for most students just assigned to work in the welfare department, the "gold content" of this job was quite high—compared to ordinary employees working daily at construction sites, docks, and factories in the commune, this job was equivalent to "cadre" status. It was respectable and the income wasn't bad. Everyone generally agreed that ruining one's future for a few *shi* of rice was a very unworthy thing to do.

This case also made a name for the newly minted "Cheka." Yi Fan was very proud. Every day when he went to work or went out, he wore a dark trench coat—leather trench coats weren't available in Lingao—looked serious, and called everyone "Comrade." And he used very formal forms of address, including full names, such as: "Comrade Wu De."

However, most of his time was spent on dry and boring financial and material audits. According to the Finance Committee's plan, the Audit Committee, or "Cheka," would conduct a comprehensive audit of all departments and institutions.

"This work is very important; it can be called a heavy burden," Cheng Dong said to Yi Fan in the Finance Committee office. "Drink some kombucha?"

"Just tea for me."

"Actually, kombucha tastes pretty good. I quite like it." Cheng Dong brewed him a cup of tea.

"The ICAC invites people for coffee; here we have tea," he joked. "I'm afraid you'll be inviting people for tea often in the future."

"I hope not," Yi Fan answered carefully. He realized this conversation was crucial and he had to hurry to grasp the leader's spirit.

"This audit is very tricky and probably won't be too smooth." Cheng Dong finally got to the main topic.

Yi Fan nodded. The formal financial system had only been gradually improved since the beginning of this year, after all. There would be no shortage of problems left over from the accounts.

"The most annoying thing is: many heads of ministries and institutions are either ignorant of the financial system or simply don't care. Some people also resist, feeling that a strict financial system and audits are a sign of distrust." Cheng Dong smiled a bit sadly. "Finance personnel are unpopular everywhere."

"They don't understand the importance of the financial system yet..."

"Yes. Everyone speaks logically about systemic problems, saying that people's self-consciousness cannot be relied upon and that strong systems must be used to guarantee compliance. But in reality?" Cheng Dong snorted. "Everyone wants to be an exception."

"That is indeed the case." Yi Fan didn't know what the leader meant by this remark, so he just agreed for now.

"Which department do you plan to start with for this comprehensive audit?" he asked.

"Guangzhou Station, of course. This station was established early, has a large volume of money and material flow, and has large expenses, including bribery funds," Yi Fan said. "I can imagine the accounts inside must be a mess. It should be the most difficult one. If we crack it, the rest will be easy."

"Not necessarily." Cheng Dong shook his head. "Guo Yi stands particularly firm. He has a family background issue and will never easily let people catch hold of anything. Moreover, since we opened the Delong branch in Guangzhou in the first half of this year, Guangzhou Station's financial system has become completely formalized—although Guangzhou has many accounts, they may not be difficult to organize."
