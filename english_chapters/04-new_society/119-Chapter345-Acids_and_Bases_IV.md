# Chapter 345 - Acids and Bases (IV)

Xu Yingjie said, "Not exactly. We call it electrolyte; the caustic soda content inside is less than 10%, and there are many impurities, needing further separation treatment."

"Pay attention, chlorine gas!" Ji Situi patted Xu Yingjie's shoulder.

"What, what." Bai Yu wanted to lean over to look.

"Careful, don't move around." Xu Yingjie was a bit excited. What he was thinking about wasn't that chlorine could disinfect, purify the environment, or be used to make hydrochloric acid, but "Poison Gas."

Although chlorine was common, it was the first poison gas put into combat in the history of modern warfare. During WWI, its battle results were remarkable, with countless souls lost to it. Moreover, chlorine was easy to produce and could act as a super weapon in this space-time. Whether Manchu White Bayara, Guanning Iron Cavalry, Gokenin, or Cromwell's Ironsides, encountering it meant only one thing: "Death."

Currently, the transmigrators' industry couldn't manufacture gas pressure vessels yet, so storing chlorine was impossible. But Xu Yingjie knew there were many perverts in the Weapon Research Group; maybe they could come up with some wicked ideas.

This yellow-green gas rose inside the glass tube, and the transmigrators present all held their breath. At this time, a small fan blade installed in another glass tube also suddenly started to rotate, indicating that another colorless electrolysis product had also come out—hydrogen.

"Everyone pay attention." Ji Situi began safety education for the workers: "This yellow gas is called chlorine. It is poisonous..."

Watching Ji Situi explain to a group of indigenous workers who seemed to understand but not really understand what chlorine was, what hydrogen was, and how to prevent poisoning and explosion, Bai Yu thought to himself that he would never come to this chemical plant again—too dangerous.

The produced hydrogen was transported to the only modern device in this set of equipment: the Hydrochloric Acid Reactor. Hydrogen was fed into the reactor to burn, then chlorine was introduced to generate hydrogen chloride gas. After cooling, it was absorbed by water to become hydrochloric acid.

This reaction was extremely dangerous. Too high a content of chlorine in hydrogen would directly cause an explosion. The solution was to strictly control the intake of chlorine during the reaction process, surrounding the toxic chlorine with excess hydrogen, allowing the chlorine to react fully, preventing pollution to the air and possible mixed explosions.

Because of the great danger, Ji Situi never considered indigenous equipment from the beginning but directly purchased equipment from the modern timeline to bring over.

Making hydrochloric acid could only consume part of the chlorine. The rest was passed into a small reaction tower on the side. The reaction tower was layered and filled with dried slaked lime. Chlorine was absorbed by slaked lime to generate calcium hypochlorite—it had a name more familiar to everyone: Bleaching Powder.

As the most common effective disinfectant, the successful mass production of bleaching powder meant that the Transmigration Group reached a new peak in disease prevention and epidemic control, having great significance for the Transmigration Group's base on both banks of the Wenlan River where the population was extremely dense. When the army launched expeditions, there was no need to worry about the hygiene of drinking water along the way anymore.

Slaked lime absorbing chlorine was difficult to complete fully; the waste gas would more or less take away some chlorine. To better utilize chlorine and simultaneously improve the air environment, a final waste gas absorption process was generally adopted.

The waste gas discharged from the absorption tower was connected by a pipe to an absorption vat containing milk of lime prepared from slaked lime. The chlorine in the waste gas was absorbed by milk of lime to generate calcium chlorate and calcium chloride.

After the milk of lime was saturated with chlorine absorption, it was pumped into a concentration pot, heated, and then cooled to crystallize calcium chlorate out. Calcium chlorate could be used as a herbicide. The liquid from which calcium chlorate had been extracted was then heated and concentrated to obtain calcium chloride. Basically achieved zero emissions of chlorine.

As for the electrolyte continuously flowing out during electrolysis, it already contained about 10% caustic soda at this time. However, the sodium chloride content in it was higher; such caustic soda liquid couldn't be used and had to undergo concentration treatment.

The equipment Ji Situi used for concentration was a big pot, directly heated and concentrated by coal ignited by firewood. The strong smell made everyone present who didn't wear safety goggles run out.

"Boiling it open like this, isn't the pollution too severe?" Bai Yu said.

"Yes, but don't we lack evaporation pans? This also wastes coal!" Ji Situi said loudly because he was wearing a chemical protective mask. "We'll change it when the machinery factory can provide matching equipment later."

After boiling for quite a while, crystals precipitated at the bottom of the pot under the alkali liquid, accumulating more and more.

"Bai Yu, quickly scoop it out with the ladle! Be careful not to bring out the alkali liquid."

Bai Yu hurriedly took the specially made wooden ladle, stood by the pot, and scraped the crystals from the bottom.

"Watch out for safety." Ji Situi watched him nervously. This pot was collected from Gou Village back then, used for cooking pig swill, with a very large diameter. One moment of inattention and falling in would be the end.

Bai Yu carefully took out the crystals. The steam filling the air above the pot felt pungent even wearing a protective mask.

"This is salt, right?" He asked.

"Correct, it's real refined salt!"

The extracted refined salt was sent to the salt drying board, washed several times with dilute alkali liquid, then rinsed with saturated refined brine; what remained were snow-white crystals. The sodium chloride purity of this salt was as high as 95% or more. It could be used to prepare physiological saline for medical infusion.

The electrolyte from which salt had precipitated continued to be heated and concentrated until the alkali liquid concentration reached about 30%, becoming a product usable for chemical engineering. Of course, it could also be further concentrated and dried into solids, but doing so consumed too much coal and was not cost-effective for the transmigrators.

The successful manufacture of sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, and caustic soda gave the Industrial and Energy Committee great confidence. Wang Luobin, Zhan Wuya, and others ran to these two crude workshops to look whenever they were free, checking out this equipment launched by indigenous methods.

Although these two sets of devices were crude, the benefits brought were immeasurable. According to Ji Situi's calculation, under the condition of guaranteed raw material and energy supply, the Contact Process Sulfuric Acid Workshop, staffed with 15 workers in three shifts, operating 345 days a year, could produce 1 ton of 98% concentrated sulfuric acid daily, increasing to 1.2 tons daily when necessary. The Salt Electrolysis Workshop, staffed with 24 workers in three shifts, operating 345 days a year, could produce 47.5 tons of caustic soda, 87 tons of bleaching powder, 2 tons of calcium chlorate, and 6 tons of calcium chloride annually. Plus 47.5 tons of refined salt (95% purity sodium chloride) and 30 tons of hydrochloric acid.

The output was negligible by modern standards, but for the Planning Committee, where allocating any chemical used to be calculated by the milliliter and gram not long ago, the production of these two workshops was tantamount to striking a windfall.

Even Shi Niaoren came. Seeing the 95% high-purity sodium chloride prepared for him by Ji Situi, Shi Niaoren was so happy his mouth couldn't close—this solved a big problem: physiological saline for infusion and injection was settled. Bleaching powder was needless to say a good thing expected by the Ministry of Health. As for crude calcium chloride, after being refined by the pharmaceutical factory into calcium chloride injection, it could treat tetany caused by hypocalcemia, intestinal colic, ureteral colic, etc., urticaria, exudative edema, and pruritic skin diseases. Used for treating Vitamin D deficiency rickets, osteomalacia, and calcium salt supplementation for pregnant and lactating women. Significantly improving the physical quality of the people in this space-time.

With enough hydrochloric acid, the planned glucose manufacturing of the pharmaceutical factory could also be put on the construction agenda. Shi Niaoren immediately contacted Wu Nanhai, asking him to quickly provide starch raw materials so they could plan together to set up a glucose workshop immediately.

As for Wu Nanhai, he was overjoyed to suddenly obtain the herbicide he hadn't even hoped for, immediately demanding all relevant output be allocated to him. He also asked with concern when ammonium sulfate could be produced for him, so he could release a record-breaking "satellite" yield with hybrid rice.

Even people from the Ministry of Light Industry came to ask how much quota of caustic soda and sulfuric acid could be given to them. With these two things, they could provide snow-white paper; as for soap, it was even less of a problem. However, making soap required cooperation between the Chemical Department and the Light Industry Department, as the Chemical Department was supposed to obtain glycerol through the soap-making process.

This was like rolling a snowball. Once a technical bottleneck was broken, many production areas that were originally stuck suddenly moved, the number of producible products increased instantly, and production capacity expanded.

The military department responded quickly too. Xi Yazhou called the same day, requesting the Chemical Department to seriously consider the military value and usage of chlorine as a weapon.

Releasing chlorine directly was impossible. Xu Yingjie and several people from the weapon research group studied it and developed a chlorine landmine: a jar of hydrochloric acid with a packet of calcium hypochlorite powder—bleaching powder—underneath, strapped with a 30-gram guncotton charge cartridge. The explosion would blast these two substances into a mist to mix together. As for the effect, everyone agreed that if used, it was best to detonate multiple mines simultaneously.

Some also suggested making poison gas shells, same principle, improving the structure to withstand howitzer firing would do.

"Not recommended." Xu Yingjie could hardly imagine who could run around on the battlefield carrying many hydrochloric acid jars.

"In my opinion, expecting poison gas shells and poison gas mines," Lin Shenhe of the Artillery R&D Group made a concluding speech, "might as well make some glass bottles filled with hydrochloric acid and throw them out as grenades when the time comes."

The mass response was very good, and praise from various departments flooded in. But as the person in charge of the chemical department, Ji Situi wasn't happy at all. Behind this string of dazzling product catalogs and production figures lay high energy consumption and extremely unstable production states.

A salt electrolysis workshop consumed 160 tons of salt, 60 tons of quicklime, 0.5 tons of hydrochloric acid, 35 tons of coal, 140,000 kWh of DC electricity, and 1500 tons of water annually. This was a considerable amount of material and energy consumption. Especially electricity and industrial water. The installed capacity of Bopu Power Station was originally only 213KW; a single electrolysis workshop would consume nearly one-tenth of the power station's annual power generation. Power shortage actually became a major obstacle for the salt electrolysis workshop. The workshop originally planned to start last year had been pending. It wasn't until recently when the second phase expansion of Bairen Tan Hydropower Station succeeded and a locomobile there was moved to Bopu Power Station, doubling Bopu's installed capacity, that it officially started production.

Ji Situi planned to gradually replace the current overly crude equipment after the machinery department's manufacturing capability improved a grade. Such high-energy-consumption and high-pollution production was really not the future direction.

Another drawback of "Indigenous Method Launch" was "Looking Very Beautiful"; after really putting into actual operation, many problems not mentioned in construction pamphlets were exposed one after another.

The most typical was the Contact Sulfuric Acid Workshop. Since starting work, quite a few major and minor faults occurred. The most serious was the low conversion rate, less than 70%, causing the concentration of some sulfuric acid to be too low, only 80%, which had to be re-blended to reach factory standards. The blower outlet carried acid, splashing everywhere, causing severe ground corrosion; the chimney outlet smoke carried a large amount of acid, turning into acid rain immediately upon meeting moist air, eroding and destroying all temporary factory buildings and sheds around the chimney. Several workers suffered mild acid burns and were sent to the hospital.

Ji Situi, Xu Yingjie, and technicians from machinery and construction made six consecutive modifications to the entire system. Even the absorption tower was dismantled and refilled several times. Adding a pebble dust collector to the converter; adding coke as an absorbent at the air outlet; adding acid-mist-removing tile fragments plus coke to the top of the absorption tower... Fumbling, holding meetings for discussion, and flipping through books—fortunately, the Grand Library had abundant materials—solutions were found for various faults one by one. It took a whole month of tossing and turning to stabilize production.

Just as the sulfuric acid workshop stabilized, the electrolysis workshop had several small-scale accidents again. The most outrageous one was someone actually eyeing the hydrogen, identifying it for future balloon observation troops' material preparation, and insisting on filling balloons with hydrogen in the workshop. But this person wore chemical fiber clothes and touched it upon coming up... 1% of body surface suffered second-degree burns and was rushed to the hospital. The entire electrolysis workshop was paralyzed for ten hours. Ji Situi was furious and fenced off the workshop with bamboo fences, hanging a dangerous skull mark high outside. No one was allowed to enter or exit at will.

Shi Niaoren returned from visiting the Bopu Chemical Plant, incidentally settled the supply of several materials urgently needed by the pharmaceutical factory with the Planning Committee and Chemical Department, then went to the Bairen City dormitory area to take a sample before returning to the General Hospital.

"Touch once, touch again..."

Humming *Eighteen Touches*, Shi Niaoren walked into Bairen General Hospital carrying several bags of poop. Ye Yuming passing by muttered in surprise, "Is this bro silly from smelling poop all day?"

The real reason was naturally not so! Shi Niaoren sat in his "First Medical Examination Center in This Space-Time", crossed his legs confidently, piled up a bunch of stool sample jars, and smiled with ambition. The successful production launch of the Chemical Department reignited his enthusiasm for the pharmaceutical factory, which had gradually cooled down—increasing his drive greatly, pondering what other medicines could be made. This was better than ten years of hard internal training. There were people in the Transmigration Group!
