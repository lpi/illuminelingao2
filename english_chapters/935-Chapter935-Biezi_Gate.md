# Chapter 935 – Biezi Gate

The *Haitian* stayed in Kaohsiung for three days. Having met no indigenous "guidance party" as hoped, and with time limited, Li Ziping did not linger any longer. He weighed anchor and continued sailing north.

After a day of sailing, they anchored for the night at Haitan Island (Pingtan Island), Fujian, 68 nautical miles north of Taiwan proper. Haitan Island is China's fifth-largest island, approximately 27 kilometers long north-to-south and 18 kilometers wide east-to-west, with an area of 309 square kilometers.

According to data provided by the Grand Library, development of Haitan Island began in the Song Dynasty. Even more surprisingly, the Song Dynasty had established a horse-breeding supervision bureau here specifically for raising horses. This showed the local water, soil, and climate were suitable for horses to live and breed.

In the Ming Dynasty, Haitan Island already had a population of forty to fifty thousand. In scale, it was larger than Nan'ao Island, which they had just passed. The *Haitian* spent two days surveying here. As with Nan'ao Island, as soon as they landed, the island's military and civilians went on high alert, but no one attempted to expel or destroy them, leaving them to roam the island at will.

On June 2nd, the *Haitian* entered Hangzhou Bay and dropped anchor near Haining. At first light the next day, Li Ziping commanded the *Haitian* to approach Biezi Gate, preparing to enter the Qiantang River. According to the plan, the Navy required the *Haitian* to survey the channels of the Qiantang River in preparation for naval vessels entering the river directly if needed.

The main channel of the Qiantang River estuary has undergone multiple shifts throughout history. The greatest shift occurred during the Ming-Qing transition, known as the "Three Gates Shift."

Historically, between Kanshan on the south bank (Xiaoshan) and Haining on the north bank, there were successively three channels to the sea, called the "Three Gates": The channel between Kanshan and Zheshan was about 6.2 kilometers wide, called the South Gate (Nan Da Men). Because the two mountains stood opposite each other like a gate, it was anciently called Sea Gate (Hai Men). Beside Kanshan lay a small hill shaped like a soft-shelled turtle, also situated within the Sea Gate, hence it was also called Biezi Gate (Turtle Gate). The channel between Zheshan and Hezhuang Mountain was about 1.7 kilometers wide, called the Middle-Small Gate (Zhong Xiao Men); the channel between Hezhuang Mountain and the Haining seawall on the north bank was about 10.5 kilometers wide, called the North Gate (Bei Da Men). The main channel shifted first through the South Gate, second through the Middle-Small Gate, and third to the North Gate. When the *Haitian* arrived, it was the period when the main channel passed through the South Gate.

Biezi Gate had formidable terrain, a perilous spot where mountains flanked the river. In the Ming Dynasty, it was the first gateway for Hangzhou's defense against *wokou* pirates. Controlling Biezi Gate meant preventing maritime invaders from entering the Hang-Jia-Hu plain. During the Jiajing reign, Zhejiang established six guards to defend against pirates (Six Coastal Defense Guards), and Haimen Guard was responsible for defense here.

Li Ziping didn't know how many defensive facilities were around Biezi Gate area—he wasn't worried about Ming firepower, but rather about the unclear local channel conditions. If they ran aground in the river, the *Haitian*, with its limited firepower and insufficient troops, would become meat on the chopping block.

Therefore, Li Ziping was extremely cautious. Approaching Biezi Gate, the whole ship was already on alert. At the same time, all rowboats and the small steam launch were lowered. The rowboats led the way sounding depths, while the steam launch cruised around back and forth, screening the ship's navigation. He carefully ordered boiler pressure maintained—the currents at the river estuary were unpredictable, hydrological data was insufficient, and without enough mobility, running aground or hitting reefs was very easy.

According to reconnaissance and gathered intelligence, there were Ming troops at Biezi Gate, as well as forts and cannon emplacements. The sudden appearance of the *Haitian* triggered a general alarm in the surroundings. But as with their journey so far, no Ming naval vessels came out to try and drive them away. Clearly, the Ming military was wary of typical European-style ships like the *Haitian*. From years of dealing with European pirate-merchants, they knew these ships had firepower superior to their dilapidated naval vessels. Therefore, adhering to a policy of coping with shifting events by sticking to a fundamental principle, they held fast to their forts and absolutely would not sally forth.

Qian Shuixie led a small team on a probing landing. After penetrating about two kilometers inland, the coastal villages were already empty.

"They ran fast—" Qian Shuixie was greatly disappointed. Originally he had hoped to grab a few people and levy a "reasonable burden." As a result, there was nobody in the village. It was evident they left in a hurry; they hadn't even taken their pigs, chickens, or ducks.

Liu Zheng said: "How about we catch all the chickens..." Having drifted at sea for so long, always eating field rations aside from occasionally buying vegetables and eggs from fishermen, they hadn't eaten fresh meat for a long time. Getting a few fresh, tasty free-range chickens would certainly make a delicious meal.

"Then wouldn't we become 'Japanese devils'?" Qian Shuixie shook his head—this was a disciplinary violation. Levying a "reasonable burden" had policies and procedures; taking things privately now was theft, serious in nature.

The team continued forward for another kilometer. Faint, confusing human voices came from ahead. Qian Shuixie ordered a halt and sent men to scout. Before long the scouts returned to report: less than a kilometer ahead, over a thousand armed personnel were gathered, probably local government troops and militia. It was unknown whether they planned to defend to the death or charge over to wipe them out in one go.

Qian Shuixie decided to withdraw. Their mission was to probe local defenses, not capture Haining with twenty men. He ordered everyone to about-face and retreat toward the rowboats at the beach.

But at this moment, a burst of urgent gongs and drums suddenly sounded, followed by the roar of thousands of people. Qian Shuixie knew the enemy was clearly preparing to pursue.

Racing them now was unwise. The coast was still nearly 3 kilometers away; even running full tilt would take ten-plus minutes. The survey team members were still carrying heavy mapping equipment; running like that would definitely result in lost weapons and gear.

He looked at the surrounding terrain. On the outside of a bend in the road was a small hill at most five or six meters high, covered in dense trees. Below the slope was a river with much grass and vegetation, convenient for concealment and retreat.

In setting an ambush at a road bend, once the enemy encountered fire from one side of the road, they would subconsciously flee toward the other side in the same direction. The ambushers could concentrate fire to tail and shoot them without shifting firing angles.

Qian Shuixie immediately conferred with Liu Zheng, deciding that half a squad would escort the survey team to continue retreating, while Qian Shuixie took one squad to cover the rear.

"Be careful, don't get surrounded here," Liu Zheng warned.

Qian Shuixie nodded. "Won't happen. Visibility is good around here; their flanking movements can't hide from me. I'll lead the men to hit them hard here for a bit. Once the enemy retreats, I'll quickly bring the men and catch up. On the way, call the *Haitian* to support you."

"Alright, take care." Liu Zheng knew this wasn't the time for idle talk and left with his men.

"Machine gun!" he called out. The shooter in the squad using the modified bipod-equipped M77B1 automatic rifle immediately stepped forward.

"Go to the top of the hill. Fire when I open fire," Qian Shuixie said. "First hit the front of the column with a long burst, then hit the tail of the enemy column with short bursts."

"Understood, sir."

He then arranged for the soldier with the best grenade-throwing scores to act as assistant machine gunner, gathering ten grenades from other soldiers for him. The sniper was also positioned on the hill. Because the incoming force was a mixed bag of militia, the sniper had no clear priority targets. Qian Shuixie ordered him to fire at will once the enemy entered effective range.

The team deployed along the bend in the road. Qian Shuixie's intention was to use a fierce ambush to stun the pursuing enemy, take advantage of the momentum to rout them, and deprive them of the ability to pursue.

The machine gunner soon found a suitable firing position on the hill. He carefully attached the special brass catcher bag to the ejection port—this bag was a genuine original part, a vehicle accessory for the M77B1 rifle. The sniper carefully attached a simple scope to his Mosin-Nagant rifle and checked the round in the chamber one last time.

The "grenadier" opened the caps of all the grenades, tearing the moisture-proof oil paper to expose the pull cords. He studied the dirt road before him, estimating his maximum throwing distance, then stood up and gestured to see if any branches or bushes would obstruct his throw.

Wang Jiashan shouldered a bird-gun, walking chaotically along with the main body of troops.

The sun shone on Wang Jiashan, warming him. One of his arms and half a shoulder were exposed through his tattered uniform jacket. The jacket's original color was long gone; pieces hung off him here and there, barely held together by a straw rope tied randomly around his waist.

His calves were bare, his feet shod in straw sandals. If not for the tattered leather helmet on his head, the bird-gun on his back, and the leather pouch for powder and lead shot at his waist, he would look no different from a common local beggar.

Wang Jiashan was a military household soldier of the Haimen Guard. Although the Ming guard system had long since decayed, every guard unit still had some military household soldiers who drilled on ordinary days. Wang Jiashan was one of these "drilling soldiers."

As a drilling soldier, he could intermittently receive some rations and pay, and didn't have to work the fields all day for the commanders, battalion commanders, and company commanders.

In front of Wang Jiashan was his neighbor, Li Shanmin. Li Shanmin was a gloomy middle-aged man—he had seven children, from Da Min (Big/First Min) to Qi Min (Seventh Min). even though everyone who could walk was out working for others, there was never enough food. Li Shanmin's fifteen-year-old eldest son, Li Damin, wearing ragged clothes, shouldered a wooden spear and walked cheerfully in front, as if going on an outing.

Compared to the old, weak, sick, and disabled military households, the militia braves appeared somewhat more orderly, all young and strong men. Their morale was also good. They were the local militia corps from several nearby villages and towns, led by a deputy corps commander, going with the government troops to drive out the "sea bandits."

The Zhejiang coast had once been a disaster area rampant with *wokou* pirates. After *wokou* flying Japanese flags basically disappeared, "sea bandits" replaced them. However, since Ming Zhejiang had no major foreign trade ports, it didn't produce great sea lords like Zheng Zhilong, Zhong Bin, or Liu Xiang of Fujian and Guangdong. But small bands of sea bandits engaging in piecemeal raiding were still numerous. Government troops and militia frequently clashed with such bandits coming ashore to plunder.
