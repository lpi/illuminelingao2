# Chapter 998 New Recruits

The Miao people lived in hardship and, compared to the Li people, were more willing to go out to become soldiers eating military rations. During the Ming dynasty, southwestern Miao, Yao, Dong, and other ethnic native troops were conscripted for combat multiple times. The most famous were Qin Liangyu's White Pole Soldiers—with proper training and command, their combat effectiveness as infantry of this dimension was quite good. Wei Aiwen and others' recruitment activities in Miao villages proceeded very smoothly; it was just that the time and manpower costs consumed by recruitment were unreasonably high. Miao villages were located even more remotely than Li villages, in higher and deeper mountains. Without traders to guide them, they simply couldn't even find the places.

Wei Aiwen eventually recruited four companies in Changhua, two of which were Miao people. If he had been willing to recruit freely, he could have recruited more. Considering that Li and Miao people generally suffered from malaria with poor constitution, requiring significant costs for treatment and recuperation, he stopped—it wouldn't be too late to fully utilize these populations after having enough resources in the future.

All these soldiers were concentrated in Changhua for quarantine treatment and preliminary centralized training. The training camp was set up outside Changhua Fort. Their instructor was Old Di from the Training Directorate—he had been pushed out by "American faction" officers led by Shi Zhiqi for strenuously advocating so-called "German-style" training within the Marine Corps and attempting to equip Marines with mountain caps. When he applied to the Training Directorate, Fu Sanni wasn't interested in his so-called "German-style" training and German mannerisms, but seeing that Old Di had decent drive—military training instructors mainly needed enthusiasm, drive, and abundant physical strength to shout at new recruits all day plus kick and punch them—he was immediately appointed as a military training instructor for the Education Directorate. Leading a batch of staff sergeants and sergeants, he intensively drilled new recruits and militiamen daily.

After the General Staff's plan to recruit Japanese and Li-Miao new recruits as security troops came out, Fu Sanni placed this batch of people's training base in Changhua. The security forces about to be organized from soldiers didn't belong to the official Fubo Army sequence—not even the paramilitary National Army. If there was something similar for comparison, the security forces were actually similar to "Blackwater"—mercenaries, just at lower cost.

Since they were mercenaries, training them at Maniao Fort was inappropriate. Changhua was vast with sparse population; terrain and topography were more complex than Lingao. More importantly, the locality had certain basic infrastructure, suitable for small-scale troop training without needing too much expansion.

The recruited Li and Miao soldiers were thrown into basic training almost immediately after "purification" procedures—Changhua was sparsely populated, requiring no extended quarantine isolation. A medical team led by Lei En dispatched from Lingao conducted physical examinations and treatment. Lei En had worked in disease control in the old dimension; although he hadn't had much contact with malaria, at least he had studied it.

To reduce medicine consumption while avoiding expanding infection, blood smear tests for malaria parasites were conducted during soldier recruitment. More severe malaria patients were not recruited.

What puzzled Lei En, the one responsible for testing, was that some applicants, although from villages with malaria patients, hadn't been infected with malaria. It seemed they had some kind of antibodies. He recalled some materials suggesting this was because thalassemia was prevalent in the southwestern coastal region, and malaria parasites couldn't infect thalassemia patients.

"Could this theory actually be correct?" Unfortunately, local conditions in Changhua were limited, and Lei En couldn't test those soldiers for thalassemia for the moment.

What was sent from Lingao wasn't the traditional old-dimension specific drugs for treating malaria: quinine, primaquine, chloroquine, or artemisinin, but rather Chinese medicine preparations experimentally manufactured by the Health Department according to formulas provided by Daoist Zhang—"Malaria Powder" and "Changshan Decoction."

These two medicines were formulas that Chinese medicine personnel in the 1950s and 60s, when China couldn't yet produce quinine and other antimalarial drugs domestically, had collected from various folk prescriptions and proven formulas and confirmed through extensive clinical use to have certain efficacy. Also screened out at that time was sweet wormwood. However, extraction and purification of artemisinin required considerable chemical industry as support, so the Health Department could only temporarily produce the more modestly effective Malaria Powder and Changshan Decoction. Runshitang Pharmacy conducted small-scale trial production, deploying small batches to hospitals and clinics under the Health Department, as well as to the Li-Miao Affairs Office and Religious Affairs Office.

Malaria Powder was made from: cangzhu (atractylodes), baizhi (angelica dahurica), guizhi (cinnamon twigs), and other medicines combined, prepared into powder. When using, following the dose of 1g or more for adults per application (reduced for children), wrap "Malaria Powder" in gauze half an hour before malaria onset and insert into the nostril for about 3-4 hours, removing during the sweating phase after malaria onset. Can continue using before the next attack. One dose can be used consecutively more than 3 times.

If symptoms disappear after use, blood can be tested the next day; if positive, can use again. According to clinical trials at the Health Department General Hospital, this medicine and Changshan Decoction was indeed effective for some malaria patients. After several applications, malaria parasites actually disappeared during blood tests.

However, the overall effective rate wasn't as high as stated in the books. But this at least provided a means of treating malaria—one should know that by old-dimension standards, even quinine, the historical specific drug, had only modest effects, not to mention significant side effects.

The two major denominations of the Religious Affairs Office were the biggest users of these two proprietary Chinese medicines. For proselytizing in Li areas, medical and health means were most effective, and malaria was a disease common among Li and Miao people. Daoist Zhang had initially gained many converts in southern Qiong precisely through these two medicines.

The Li-Miao Affairs Office also distributed quite a bit of such medicines, mainly through dispatching health teams. The so-called health teams' main purpose was still trading with Li areas, just dispatching a medic in the team carrying medicines to villages for diagnosis and treatment. This treatment was free, the main purpose naturally being to win hearts; secondarily, it provided medics and nurses attending health training courses with practical independent diagnosis and treatment opportunities.

Mu Min herself had personally led teams to quite a few villages and knew what this kind of health service meant in mountain villages. So successfully recruiting many soldiers this time wasn't surprising to her—one should know that initially quite a few Senators were skeptical about whether they could recruit Li and Miao able-bodied men as soldiers.

The able-bodied men were undergoing the most basic formation training under Old Di's shouting. The infantry companies composed of Li and Miao people weren't being equipped with firearms for now—equipped with Model 1631 standard knives. Thus training content was greatly reduced—they didn't practice complex formation changes or anti-cavalry charge drills, nor Minié rifle shooting training. Only the most basic formation, basic tactical movements, and physical training. After basic training, another two weeks of mountain combat and village security combat tactical training.

Mu Min watched for a while the new recruits wearing somewhat oversized training uniforms, looking severely malnourished. After several days of training, their movements were starting to take shape. Then she cast her gaze with interest at Old Di. He wasn't wearing Fubo Army uniform but a "German-style" mixed uniform that looked uncomfortably hot. The upper body was an Africa Corps regulation tropical shirt, but below he wore combat boots, German-style puttees, knee pads, buckled with a double-breasted belt, head wearing a combat soft-top peaked cap—all domestically produced civilian versions, of course.

Beside Old Di stood a young girl wearing the girls' uniform of Lingao National School, holding a tin megaphone. Every time Old Di spoke, she quickly picked up the megaphone and spoke for a while. This translator sometimes obviously didn't know how to translate certain commands and had to consult with Old Di. The Li people mostly didn't understand Chinese—much less Mandarin. Chinese language teaching couldn't be achieved overnight; they could only train while learning.

Mu Min knew this girl was Bi Da. When they left Changhua to return to Lingao back then, they had brought her along too. She studied Chinese for a period at National School and also received basic literacy education, obtaining a C-grade diploma. As one of the very few "completely reliable" Li people under the Li-Miao Affairs Office's control, upon completing her studies she was dispatched back to Changhua, serving as a staff member of the Li-Miao Office locally. On one hand as interpreter, dealing with local Li people; on the other hand collecting materials on the local Meifu Li. Mu Min had read some of her reports written in crooked simplified characters full of typos.

Bi Da played a very important role in Changhua. Although they also had control of local people with close Li village connections like Wang Daliang, they weren't ultimately from Li villages themselves. Compared to Bi Da, a native-born Li person, they fell short in negotiations and material collection. Especially Fang Jinghan, who collected large amounts of first-hand materials on the local Meifu Li through conversations with her.

Whether Mu Min or Fang Jinghan currently in charge of routine work at the Li-Miao Affairs Office, both valued her greatly. Every time they came to Changhua, they would talk with her and bring her many booklets, personally cultivating her. Mu Min had once wanted her to study for a B-grade diploma at National School.

The Li-Miao Office wasn't the only one who valued Bi Da; Daoqianzi was also very interested in her. After a successful proselytizing activity, Daoist Zhang persuaded Bi Da to convert to Neo-Daoism. Then he wanted to cultivate this girl into a "Libationer" of Neo-Daoism, becoming his capable assistant for proselytizing in Li areas—if possible, becoming a model figure.

Unfortunately, Bi Da's learning enthusiasm was only average—Li people didn't have the universal recognition that "all trades are base, only study is lofty." Thus whether National School's advanced study plan or Daoqianzi's religious education all came to nothing. However, in two years Bi Da could at least communicate with Senators without any obstacles, and her loyalty to the Senate was also sufficiently high—clearly quite qualified as a bridge between the Senate and the Meifu Li.
