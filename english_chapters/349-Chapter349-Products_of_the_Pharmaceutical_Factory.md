# Chapter 349 - Products of the Pharmaceutical Factory

While Huang Dashan was trial-producing Sweet Potato Kvass, Shi Niaoren was washing bottles at the pharmaceutical factory—glass bottles applied for from the Planning Committee for a long time had finally arrived. Most were produced by the glass factory, and some were recycled and sterilized. Thousands of bottles of various sizes were placed in rattan baskets, piling up the entire courtyard of the pharmaceutical factory. Bottle specifications ranged from 500ml for physiological saline to small medicine vials.

So the entire pharmaceutical factory staff washed bottles for a good half day. The washed bottles were pushed into the steam room for high-temperature steam sterilization—this was also the most effective large-scale sterilization method in the pharmaceutical factory at present.

With these bottles, the pharmaceutical factory could officially produce finished products—otherwise, there was no place to put the products. Zhao Yanmei set up an all-glass equipment distillation room; besides distilling medical distilled water, it was also used to make Chinese herbal medicine extracts for injection use.

Shi Niaoren gazed at this not-too-complex but bulky distillation facility, marveling that the glass factory's level was advancing by leaps and bounds. Such complex shapes, numerous thick and thin pipes, multi-way connectors, and valves. Alcohol lamps for heating flickered with blue flames; evaporating dishes contained many yellow and white plant flowers; liquid bubbled slightly; steam passed through pipes, went through the serpentine glass tube condenser, and finally fell drop by drop into the collection bottle.

The whole scene looked very strange, neither sci-fi nor fantasy, but like a mad scientist's underground laboratory in some low-budget movie.

"What is being done here?"

"Distilling and extracting Honeysuckle, medicine for heatstroke prevention, specifically treating summer heat colds. Liu San said this could serve as a base liquid to make Shuanghuanglian preparations." Hu Yicheng was in charge of this distillation room today, happy not to have to go to the underground strain room for continuous culture.

"Is this safe or not?" He muttered. Chinese medicine injection ingredients were unclear with many impurities; injecting normally into the human body like this, once an allergic reaction occurred, even resuscitation couldn't be done.

Hu Yicheng saw his thoughts, "Oral concentrated liquid. Drinking it causes diarrhea at most; it definitely won't kill anyone."

"I just feel it's risky, so I worry." Shi Niaoren sighed.

"After distilling this batch, we prepare to make Bupleurum Injection. The difficulty is somewhat smaller. Liu San dried a lot in the yard. Very effective for fever and colds."

"But this set of equipment is a bit low in efficiency."

Liu San walked out from inside: "Already ordered another set. Being made in the glass factory. This time heating plans to use steam heating. Much more efficient than burning alcohol lamps here, and temperature is easy to control too. Minister, come sit in my room."

Saying this, he led him into his Traditional Chinese Medicine pharmaceutical workshop.

This workshop was actually a large room of about a hundred square meters with a high ceiling. Earthenware pots on a row of stoves were bubbling and boiling Chinese medicine. On the operating table, hay cutters for cutting medicine, mortars of various materials, sixteen-tael small scales for Chinese medicine... various equipment Shi Niaoren had seen or hadn't seen were piled everywhere. Some were brought by Liu San himself, and some were custom-made here.

Shi Niaoren sniffed the medicinal smell filling the air and found a stool to sit down.

"These are some medicines I compounded myself." Liu San enthusiastically showed him a row of paper boxes and small porcelain bottles on the table.

"This is Hemostatic Powder," Liu San picked up a small porcelain bottle, "Made from Japanese Thistle (*Cirsium japonicum*). Function is cooling blood and stopping bleeding: used for bleeding syndromes caused by blood heat reckless movement, such as hematemesis, epistaxis, metrorrhagia, hematuria, etc.; dispersing stasis, detoxifying and subsiding swelling: used for heat toxin carbuncle and swelling, oral administration or external application..."

"Alright, alright, stop reciting your Chinese medicine books." Shi Niaoren looked skeptically. He knew Chinese medicine had a characteristic wherein almost every medicinal material could list a huge pile of "effective against so-and-so symptoms", but actually very few could truly play a key role, "Does it work?"

"Of course it works. Field bleeding, immediately find Japanese Thistle water decoction for oral administration, effective immediately. Crushing for external application also stops bleeding."

Shi Niaoren thought there probably was some component inside that could reduce blood clotting time; it could be organized for research—future military combat demand for hemostatic drugs wouldn't be small.

"Also: Tincture soaked out with ethanol can lower blood pressure and inhibit human tuberculosis bacilli."

"Sounds not bad."

"This is Gastritis Pill, treating stomach pain, acid reflux, gastric ulcer, and duodenal ulcer, etc. Main ingredient is Cuttlebone. I got it from the seafood processing factory. Can also make hemostatic medicine; treating knife wounds is very effective."

"This is Pig Bile Pill." Liu San said, "treats many things, but I know Dean, you aren't interested in these. However, there is one use you will definitely think is useful."

"Oh? What."

"Stopping cough." Liu San said, "Pig bile powder's cough-stopping effect has passed pharmacological tests. Can also treat night blindness."

"Opium Tincture." Liu San took out another bottle with a danger mark, "Can be used for suppressing cough, stopping diarrhea, and relieving pain."

"How about addictiveness?"

Liu San spread his hands: "Hard to say; needs animal experiments. But I studied with Dean Zhao and Little Hu, and also flipped through medical books; made completely according to pharmacopoeia requirements. Harmfulness won't be too big; just control usage."

"Don't make it in the form of a panacea." Shi Niaoren instructed, "Divide into three varieties. Diarrhea and pain relief medicine are best made into tablets—easy to take; cough medicine made into syrup. Regardless of which medicine, while ensuring efficacy, minimize opium content to avoid producing addiction."

Although opium addiction wasn't as severe as modern hard drugs, withdrawal was also very troublesome.

"Okay, we'll modify the formula." Liu San casually noted down his request. Then took out a small wooden box, opened it mysteriously: "Dr. Shi, taste it?"

Shi Niaoren looked; inside the box was a kind of semi-withered leaf, rolled into balls.

"Betel nut?" He picked one up and stuffed it into his mouth. Extremely bitter.

"It's Coca leaf."

"Mmh..." Shi Niaoren almost vomited on the spot.

"Rest assured, won't get addicted." Liu San laughed mischievously, "Or at most as addictive as betel nut."

Shi Niaoren of course knew that in South America, chewing Coca leaves could count as a "national habit". Indians used it to refresh their minds, eliminate fatigue, and increase strength; also used to ward off cold, cure diseases, relieve discomfort caused by stomach cramps, rheumatism, headaches, etc. It was a mass pastime item.

"This is leaf picked from Coca trees in the farm. Trees are too small; only picked a very small bit. Everyone got a little share." Liu San said, "After yield goes up later, we can pick in large quantities."

"What's the meaning of wanting this thing?"

"Coca leaves can also make medicine." Liu San said, "Using this to replace cigarettes as a pastime for the army and laborers, wouldn't it be better."

"This—" Shi Niaoren thought this was too awesome. However, Coca leaves indeed had a strong spirit-invigorating effect, truly useful for the army and laborers, "Is it a bit too much." After all, Coca leaf was also a soft drug. Although addictiveness wasn't strong.

"Amphetamine was prepared by Yankees for soldiers in World War III back then; people were much more universal-value than us. Coca leaf isn't as toxic as Amphetamine." Saying this he took out a bottle from behind again. Poured Shi Niaoren a full cup of dark liquid, "Try drinking."

"What is this?" Shi Niaoren suddenly became alert.

"Cola."

"Cola? This thing is rare now." Shi Niaoren looked softly but suspiciously, took a sip, and indeed it was the taste of Cola. A bit sweeter, just without gas—like Cola that had been left for a long time and went flat.

"You mixed it yourselves?"

"Right, put in Coca leaf distillate inside." Seeing Shi Niaoren about to flare up, Liu San hurriedly added a sentence, "Very little. Almost negligible. As long as we have baking soda, we can put Cola into production."

Really strange: Shi Niaoren thought to himself, soda water didn't succeed, but Kvass and Cola both came out. He decided not to tangle further, lest there be some strange things wanting him to be a guinea pig. Asked:

"How is the extraction of Willow Bark I mentioned last time going?"

Willow bark has been a commonly used antipyretic and analgesic in Europe and Asia since ancient times; the effective component within is salicylic acid. Modern drug Aspirin was born based on the analysis of this drug.

Aspirin was chemically synthesized; for the transmigrators' chemical level, it was still too early. But extracting effective components from willow bark wasn't hard to do and could also play a certain role.

"Doing it, extracted some. But there aren't many willow trees here." Liu San said.

"We can ask Wu Nanhai to plant more by the river. Decorates the scenery and serves as raw material." Shi Niaoren knew the effective medicinal components contained in willow bark and willow leaves were very few, and the effect extracted was also limited. But Aspirin was a very useful analgesic and antipyretic, also having anticoagulant and anti-rheumatic functions. At the current stage, it was the best panacea.

Liu San said: "I have a request, hope Minister speaks to the Executive Committee."

"Oh, what request do you have."

"Acquire the herbal medicine shop in the county town."

"Runshitang?" Shi Niaoren knew Liu San often went to this pharmacy to buy medicine and process medicinal materials, cooperating happily with the other party, "Aren't you cooperating quite well."

"Shopkeeper Yang's thinking is okay; trusting them to do things counts as reliable too. But I am not the owner; many things are inconvenient to decide myself. Wasting a few professionals inside in vain." He poured himself a cup of "Cola", "Besides, the foundation of the herbal medicine shop is too thin, can't even go to the medicine market, and precious medicinal materials are never stocked. As a partner, it's too weak. Need to give it blood transfusion. I originally wanted to inject capital myself, but I have no silver..."

"Let the Executive Committee acquire it, then you go be the shopkeeper?"

"I don't want to be the shopkeeper—being the owner guiding them how to do it is enough. Shopkeeper Yang inside doesn't have much insight, but the person loves to learn. Is a malleable talent."
