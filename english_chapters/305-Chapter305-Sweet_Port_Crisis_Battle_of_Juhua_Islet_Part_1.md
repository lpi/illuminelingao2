# Chapter 305 - Sweet Port Crisis: Battle of Juhua Islet (Part 1)

Why starboard and not port? This question was meaningless. Le Lin had been in the Navy for months, and he understood the basic military principle of obeying orders.

"Aim directly at the hull," Xi Yazhou said with some regret. "It's a pity we don't have explosive shells; otherwise, one hit would be enough to sink a ship."

"We can use incendiary shot," Le Lin suggested.

The so-called "incendiary shot" was not a napalm bomb, white phosphorus, or thermite, but a solid iron ball heated until it glowed red. This device was quite effective, but gunners had to handle it with extreme caution. Consequently, neither Army nor Navy artillerymen particularly liked using this type of ammunition.

"Alright, use incendiary shot."

The ship's 12-pounder cannons were one of the four standard artillery pieces recently manufactured by the Industrial Department based on Lin Shenhe's proposal, intended for the Army. They were copies of the American M1857 12-pounder Napoleon. Although smoothbore, with a standard 1.13 kg powder charge, they could accurately project a standard 12-pound shot to 1,480 meters at a 5-degree elevation, and a staggering 1,911 meters at 10 degrees. Despite being smoothbore, their accuracy was quite high for the era, capable of engaging enemies at 1,000 meters, and a few rounds could incapacitate an entire company. Both sides in the American Civil War used them extensively.

The only drawback was their weight—nearly half a ton. But mounted on a ship's deck to bombard maritime targets, this was not an issue.

To facilitate naval firing, the four cannons were mounted on battery carriages fixed to simple turntables, utilizing recoil friction for resetting.

The nearest enemy ship on the starboard side was less than one nautical mile away. With the power of the M1857, the enemy was well within range, but Xi Yazhou did not order fire.

His plan was to ensure a kill with the first strike: the *Great Whale* had to hold out for at least twenty minutes before Squadron A arrived from ten nautical miles away. Thus, the first volley had to score hits and inflict massive casualties; otherwise, a bitter struggle would ensue.

The M1857's accuracy on land was naturally excellent, but hitting a target at 1,000 meters from a pitching deck was another matter entirely. Though not a naval enthusiast, Xi Yazhou knew that in the age of sail, naval gunnery only ensured consistent hits within 100 meters. The British even emphasized holding fire until within 50 meters.

Even if the M1857 was superior in power and accuracy to old-fashioned smoothbores, to ensure precision, closing the range to within 400 meters was essential.

Ten minutes passed. Everyone waited. The gun captains stared at the iron balls in the heating furnace. For safety, the furnace was surrounded by a thick layer of sand, and sandbags were ready to smother it instantly if necessary. Behind the sandbag barricades, marines peered out through firing ports. The pirate ships drew closer.

Xi Yazhou put on an M80 steel helmet brought by a messenger but refused the ballistic vest; wearing that on deck would create lethal heatstroke. He remained silent, carefully observing the enemy's movements through his telescope. As he had estimated, the three ships on the right were advancing faster, while the four on the left lagged behind.

Finally, the nearest ship closed to within 400 meters.

"Deck and gun crews, attention!" he called out.

Steps shuffled briefly across the ship, then silence returned.

"Commence firing!" Xi Yazhou ordered. "Target: 3 o'clock."

The order was immediately relayed to the deck. The straw mats covering the gun positions were swiftly thrown aside, and the sandbags obstructing the field of fire were pushed into the sea, revealing four dark cast-iron cannon barrels.

"Range: two cables!" The rangefinder operator quickly called out the direct distance.

The gunners remained motionless—they were Army artillerymen, accustomed to using meters. Le Lin hurriedly corrected: "Target 3 o'clock! Range 360 meters!"

"Target 360 meters, load one incendiary shot!"

Gunners rapidly placed a wet clay cake—molded from straw and clay—over the powder charge in the bore. Then, using iron tongs, a gunner carefully plucked a red-hot iron ball from the furnace. Two gunners used an iron carrier to hoist the searing ball and load it into the muzzle.

The danger of this procedure was evident; if the clay cake failed to isolate the gunpowder, the cannon would discharge prematurely, and the gunners busy at the muzzle would certainly not survive.

"Fire!" Le Lin shouted.

The four cannons fired in sequence from one to four with practiced rhythm. The deck was instantly shrouded in light smoke.

"Damn it!" Xi Yazhou cursed. The smoke from black powder was truly annoying. When would they get nitrocellulose propellant?

Only after the breeze cleared the smoke could Xi Yazhou see the effect of the attack: the lead single-masted ship had been hit above the waterline and was emitting black smoke. Men on its deck were frantically drawing water to douse the flames.

Although effective, it wasn't an "instant kill." Xi Yazhou was somewhat disappointed.

At this moment, white smoke rose from the three ships approaching head-on, followed by the boom of cannons. But their hastily fired shots fell into the sea far from the *Great Whale*. Xi Yazhou knew the enemy's artillery was weak; without closing to 50 meters, they were practically useless. He could boldly focus on finishing off the starboard ships first.

In the next volley, an incendiary shot punched through a sail and flew into the sea. The enemy sail caught fire, quickly turning into a torch. Another shot swept across the quarterdeck, flattening the entire aft sail arrangement and tearing the dozen men gathered there into charred, broken pieces.

"Good! Good hit!" Xi Yazhou was extremely excited witnessing this. "Continue firing incendiary shot!"

But they were out of hot shot. It took a long time to heat a cold iron ball to redness in a furnace. Le Lin had already ordered a switch to solid shot.

The distance closed to 200 meters. At this range, the 12-pounders were almost unerring. The lead starboard ship was completely paralyzed, raging fire consuming its stern, its deck littered with mangled corpses.

Smoke from the cannon fire shrouded the *Great Whale*'s deck. As a gust of wind cleared it, Le Lin nearly screamed—one of the port-side single-masted ships had closed to within fifty meters. Bare-chested pirates, murderous with double-headed spears, waist sabers, and bamboo pikes, glared with bloodshot eyes, waiting for the moment of contact to leap aboard and slaughter.

At the marine platoon leader's command, the marines behind the sandbags opened fire. With a disciplined volley, the pirates massed on the deck fell like wheat before a scythe, toppling into the water in rows.

Simultaneously, the four cannons aimed at the starboard enemy fired a beautiful broadside. Four hits out of four. The 12-pound iron balls tore a massive hole in the waterline of a twin-masted ship. It began to sink, and the pirates aboard scrambled into the sea, trying to climb onto another ship behind them.

A cheer rose from the deck. "One sunk, one set afire," Le Lin reported.

"Good," Xi Yazhou replied. "Continue firing. Switch to canister!"

The marine volley had inspired him. Since the range was under 200 meters, firing canister shot at ships with zero protection and decks crowded with men would yield excellent results. Even if it didn't sink them, it would massacre the crew and cripple their boarding capability.

The 12-pounder canister shot began to sweep the pirate decks. Each shot sprayed 68 iron balls, scouring the enemy decks like a hailstorm. Almost no one could survive such a bombardment. The last ship on the starboard side, packed with pirates preparing to board, fell silent after one broadside; no moving figures remained on deck.

The threat from the starboard was largely neutralized, but the three Gu family ships approaching head-on had reached the *Great Whale*. They pounced, twelve bow-mounted cannons firing simultaneously, giving the *Great Whale* no room to evade.

The *Great Whale* was hit. Stones and iron balls thudded into the sandbags with dull impacts; damp straw mats smoked. Then a shot struck the foremast, bringing the sail down in a chaotic heap. Howls of triumph erupted from the enemy ships.

The duel continued for ten minutes. Both the enemy ships and the *Great Whale* were hidden in white gunpowder smoke. Only when it cleared could the damage be assessed. The *Great Whale* took its first casualties: an iron ball penetrated a sandbag wall, instantly killing three marines and a gunner behind it.

"Take cover!" Xi Yazhou shouted. Suddenly his head jolted, leaving him dizzy—a stone projectile had glanced off his helmet.

The pirate ships began attacking with every available weapon. Bird-guns crackled; stone balls, iron shot, lead slugs, arrows, javelins, and torches rained down on the *Great Whale*. Despite the sandbag ramparts, casualties mounted. Xi Yazhou was nearly hit several times; for a split second, his calves trembled, and he desperately wanted to dive behind cover. But believing in his "heroic aura," he stood firm on the sterncastle, issuing orders calmly, as if reviewing a ceremonial salute.

"Where is Squadron A?" Xi Yazhou looked calm but was panicking inside. If Squadron A didn't arrive soon, they would be forced into hand-to-hand combat.

Casualties increased. The dead and wounded were moved to the lower deck for emergency treatment. Sailors scattered sand over the blood-slicked deck to prevent slipping.

"Fire!"

"Double canister!"

"Fire on the mizzenmast, damage control team!"

"Medic, man down!"

...

The shouts of sailors, accompanied by the roar of guns and enemy screams, gave Le Lin a thrill that was both dangerous and exhilarating. Covered in cold sweat, he was immersed in an indescribable, floating euphoria. Waving a pistol in one hand and a naval officer's saber in the other, he shouted incessantly in Cantonese—no one understood him, nor was it necessary. Training kicked in; everyone knew their duty.

The *Great Whale*, blazing with gunfire and wreathed in smoke, moved slowly like a fire-breathing dragon across the sea.

Suddenly, Xi Yazhou noticed the enemy ships turning. Squadron A must be here! He grabbed his telescope. Indeed, in a gap in the smoke, two trawlers were approaching at full speed, white waves churning, naval ensigns flying.

"Finally!" he muttered.

The arrival of the two trawlers ended the battle instantly. Gu Dachun, though shocked by the *Great Whale*'s firepower, had relied on his superior numbers. He believed that by swarming and boarding, he could still capture the ship, especially since his own three commanded vessels were largely intact. But the arrival of these two mastless, oarless fast ships told him immediately who he was facing.

The opponents were the Australians who had defeated Liu Xiang and Zhu Cailao! No wonder their firepower was so terrifying! Gu Dachun was filled with dread. Compared to Master Zhu in Leizhou, Gu Dachun, who lived by the sea, had heard many rumors about the Australians—especially about their great iron ships and fast iron boats.

"Quick, signal to retreat!" Gu Dachun's face was pale as he gave the order.

The direction of escape needed no instruction. For years, whenever a raid went wrong or government troops chased them, they fled into the Chrysanthemum Islets. Once past Cat's Leap Pass, they were safe. Against these iron fast boats, running in a straight line meant death. Their only chance was the maze of the islets.

Gu's three ships turned first, using sails and sculling oars to flee toward the islets. The remaining ships followed suit.

On the sea, two listless, drifting ships and one blazing vessel were left behind. Their crews were practically annihilated, masts and rudders destroyed. Even if survivors remained, the ships were dead in the water. The wails and curses of abandoned pirates drifted on the wind.
