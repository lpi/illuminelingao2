Chapter 66 Bailaren Beach (2) Revised

While the construction was in full swing, a small accident happened.

A hired local worker accidentally fell into the river while working. The water was turbulent, and he was about to be washed away.

"Save him!"

A Transmigrator jumped into the water without hesitation. He was a member of the swimming team, with excellent water skills.

He struggled to swim to the worker, grabbed his collar, and dragged him to the shore.

People on the shore hurriedly pulled them up.

"Are you okay?"

The worker was scared silly, shivering all over.

"Thank you... thank you master for saving my life!" He knelt down and kowtowed.

This scene moved the local workers present deeply.

In their eyes, the master's life was precious, and the worker's life was cheap. They never expected that a master would risk his life to save a worker.

"The Australian masters really treat us as human beings!" This sentence spread among the workers.

The cohesion of the Transmigrators was further enhanced.

With the efforts of everyone, the cofferdam of the hydropower station was finally closed.

"Close the gate! Store water!"

The river water was intercepted and the water level rose slowly.

"Start the generator!"

The huge turbine began to rotate, driving the generator to run.

"Buzzing..."

The current passed through the transmission line and lit up the light bulb on the construction site.

"Success! We have electricity!"

The cheers resounded through the valley.

This was the first hydropower station in the Ming Dynasty. It symbolized that the Transmigrators had initially solved the energy problem.

With electricity, the construction of the industrial zone accelerated.

Machines started running, and sparks splashed.

Steel was rolled out, and parts were processed.

The industrial machine of the Transmigrators began to roar.
