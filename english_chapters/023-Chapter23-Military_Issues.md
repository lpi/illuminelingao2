Chapter 23 Military Issues

The military issue was the highlight of this meeting. After all, going to a strange and dangerous world, without force protection is absolutely impossible.

Xi Yazhou, representing the Military Group, took the stage. He was tall and burly, with sharp eyes, exuding a soldier's aura all over.

"Comrades, the world we are going to face is not a idyllic paradise, but a jungle where the weak are prey to the strong." Xi Yazhou went straight to the point, "Ming army, pirates, bandits, Western colonists... These are all our potential enemies. We must have a strong armed force to protect ourselves and our achievements."

"Our goal is to build a modernized army. An army with advanced weapons, strict discipline and modern tactics."

"First of all, weapons. We can't rely on those air guns and machetes forever. We need real guys."

"We want to manufacture rifles, machine guns, artillery... We want to equip our soldiers to the teeth."

"Wait, can we make guns and cannons?" Someone questioned, "This requires high-precision machining and special materials."

"We can start from the simple ones." Xi Yazhou explained, "For example, the Minié rifle. It is a front-loading rifle, simple in structure but high in accuracy and long in range. It is an epoch-making weapon in the mid-19th century. With our industrial capabilities, mass production is completely feasible."

"There are also 12-pounder Napoleon cannons. This is a classic smoothbore cannon, powerful and mobile. It can fire solid shots, explosive shells and canister shots, capable of dealing with various targets."

"As for machine guns and modern rifles, we can develop them slowly later."

"Besides weapons, personnel training is also key." Xi Yazhou continued, "We want to implement a compulsory military service system. All adult men must receive military training and serve as reserve soldiers."

"We also need to establish a military academy to train officers and professional and technical personnel."

"Our tactics should also keep pace with the times. We want to abandon the rigid formation tactics of ancient times and adopt flexible skirmish lines and infiltration tactics. We want to give full play to our firepower advantage."

"What about the navy?" Someone asked, "We are landing on an island. Without a navy, we can't do anything."

"The navy is our top priority." Xi Yazhou nodded, "We want to build a strong navy to control the ocean."

"We can start by modifying fishing boats and merchant ships, installing artillery and power systems on them to turn them into armed ships."

"In the future, we want to build our own warships. Frigates, destroyers, cruisers... even aircraft carriers!"

"Aircraft carriers?" Everyone exclaimed, "Is this too exaggerated?"

"Not exaggerated." Xi Yazhou smiled, "Of course, not modern nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, but 'seaplane carriers' or 'escort carriers'. We can manufacture simple seaplanes for reconnaissance and bombing."

"With air superiority, we are invincible!"

Xi Yazhou's speech made everyone's blood boil. They seemed to see the scene of the Transmigrator army sweeping the world.

However, a discordant voice sounded.

"Director Xi, your plan sounds great, but have you considered the logistics issue?" It was Ma Qianzhu.

"Wars are fought with logistics." Ma Qianzhu poured cold water, "A rifle needs thousands of bullets, a cannon needs hundreds of shells. Plus food, medicine, fuel... Can our production capacity keep up?"

"Also, where do the soldiers come from? We only have 500 people. Even if everyone is a soldier, it's only a battalion. Can we control the whole of China with this little force?"

Xi Yazhou was stunned. He admitted that he had considered it too idealistically.

"So," Ma Qianzhu continued, "We must take the route of 'elite soldiers + local troops'. The Transmigrators serve as officers and technical backbones, and recruit a large number of locals as soldiers. We use advanced weapons and tactics to equip them and train them into a strictly disciplined modern army."

"At the same time, we must establish a strong logistics support system. Military industry, transportation, medical care... everything must prioritize serving the war."

"Correct!" Wen Desi nodded in agreement, "We want to fight a 'people's war'. Mobilize the masses and rely on the masses."

The discussion on military issues lasted for a long time. Everyone reached a consensus on army building ideas, weapon selection, strategic layout, etc.

Finally, the establishment of the "People's Liberation Army of Lingao" (PLA) was decided. Xi Yazhou was appointed as the commander-in-chief, and Ma Qianzhu as the chief of staff.

Under their leadership, this army will become the sharpest sword in the hands of the Transmigrators, clearing all obstacles for the construction of the new world.
