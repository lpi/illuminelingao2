# Chapter 14: The Secret House

Xiao Zishan and the others quickly rose and returned the greeting. Their earlier wariness of people from another timespace had faded considerably—they were living, breathing people, just like us. In particular, Gao Ju's conduct over these several transactions had impressed them as a man of integrity, worth cultivating. After the crossing, he would surely be a great help.

After an exchange of pleasantries, they got down to business. With the help of their new hydraulic hand truck, they had hauled over four pallet loads—more than a hundred crates of goods.

Xiao Zishan's promotional items were exhausted. This shipment had all been purchased wholesale from the market: mirrors of various sizes and styles, disposable lighters, frosted and spray-decorated glassware. Wen Desi, having done extensive research, discovered that pearls fetched high prices in the late Ming; so they had also bought large quantities of cultured pearls, large and small.

The steward had men open the sample crates and present them one by one to Master Gao. He had long been mentally prepared for the Australian merchants to bring rare goods with every visit, yet each new item still astonished him inwardly. The disposable lighters in particular captivated him—nothing could rival their convenience for starting a fire.

Master Gao examined the Wenzhou-made lighter in his hand—by now, translucent plastic no longer amazed him. He flicked it several times, then stared at it for a long while in admiration: "This method of striking fire is no different from flint and steel, except that oil replaces tinder and a wheel strikes the spark. Nothing within is rare; yet your craftsmen have combined such ingenuity into one small, exquisite, convenient object—truly unmatched."

Wen Desi and the others nodded to themselves: who said the ancients were ignorant? Master Gao had grasped the lighter's principle at a glance. Of course, the gasoline inside was something ancients couldn't produce, but he recognized the liquid was oil.

"However, this lighter cannot be refilled," Wen Desi explained. "Once empty, it's discarded."

"Is that so? A pity, a pity." Master Gao stopped flicking it. "Why can't it be refilled? To discard such a clever, practical thing seems a waste."

Wen Desi wondered how to explain the concept of disposability. Should he tell him that in their timespace, everything was disposable? That might scare him half to death. He hedged, saying the craftsmen were working on improvements.

After the goods were handed over, the total came to over thirty thousand taels of silver. Several full-length dressing mirrors nearly made Master Gao's eyes pop out—even in the palace, such things would surely leave the Emperor slack-jawed.

The pearls they brought also won Gao Ju's favor. Since the troubles erupted in Liaodong, tribute pearls from the northeast had ceased; harvests of South Sea pearls were also meager. The market was desperately short.

Master Gao knew they liked gold; he exchanged a thousand taels' worth. Then he ordered the porcelain from his storeroom brought out—as much as would fit on the pallets, all tightly bound with straw rope. Truthfully, he had no idea how these three managed to transport more cargo each visit. Though he dared not ask, he speculated whether they might know some sort of teleportation sorcery.

Xiao Zishan gazed at the crates of gold and silver in the hall and felt almost dizzy. Thank goodness they'd bought the hydraulic truck—how else would they move nearly a ton of precious metal? While his mind wandered, he heard Wen Desi inquire about the house-purchasing commission.

Gao Ju pondered a moment, then said: "Normally this would be no trouble. But as overseas merchants, you gentlemen are not permitted under Ming law to purchase property here. Of course, you are all of Chinese descent; your speech and appearance are Chinese enough. Change your attire and you could quietly take up residence without difficulty. Only—lately, with these rare goods appearing on the market, I find myself under considerable scrutiny..."

At this, they understood: success attracts attention. With so many unprecedented goods suddenly appearing in Guangzhou, who knew how many eyes and ears were watching.

This meant their original plan to establish a foothold inside the city had fallen through. According to the key element in the overall crossing strategy: Guangzhou was to serve as the mainland trade gateway for the base, exporting modern industrial products manufactured in the Hainan base and importing various materials and personnel. It would also be a window for observing Ming developments.

Seeing the disappointment on Wen Desi's party's faces, Gao Ju revealed his own proposal—one he had been considering for some time. In his view, the Australian merchants wanted to buy a house because they needed a stable location for long-term trade, a place to store goods and lodge personnel. This was the same motive as when the Portuguese had bribed high officials to lease Macau—only on a smaller scale.

"However, I do have another idea..." Gao Ju stroked his sparse whiskers, looking at them inquiringly.

"Please enlighten us, Master Gao."

"What you gentlemen want is simply a place to stay in the city. I have a property here. If you do not find it beneath you, it is yours to use."

Gao Ju dismissed the maids and summoned two trusted personal servants. He slipped the keys into his sleeve and led the way. The party passed through narrow alleys until they reached the back courtyard. The air carried the ammonia smell of mules and horses—they had reached the stable yard. But Master Gao did not enter; instead, he circled around a wall corner. At the end of the passageway was a small house. An elderly servant sat by the door; seeing the master arrive, he hastily rose.

"Open the door," Gao Ju ordered.

The old servant produced a key from beneath his clothes and let them in. On the wall of the inner room was another iron-clad door. Unbolting and unlocking it, they stepped out and found themselves outside the estate entirely. Before them lay an extremely secluded cobblestone path that ran along the base of the city wall. On one side was wasteland beneath the wall foundations; on the other, the high rear walls of wealthy households. No one was about; weeds grew wild along the path. As they walked, they occasionally passed branching alleys.

"The alleys lead to the main road out front; their entrances all have wooden gates that are normally kept locked. Though this path is public land, ordinary people cannot get in."

After several hundred meters, they reached a rear wall so weathered and dilapidated by wind and rain that it was nearly crumbling. Unlocking the door, they entered a small rear courtyard paved with blue stone slabs, planted with banana trees and flowers—very secluded. Proceeding inward, they found three connected courtyards, all kept extremely clean, fully furnished with all necessities.

"This is my secondary residence. Reserved for emergencies."

So this was Master Gao's secret house. He had several such properties in and around Guangzhou. This one was meant as a place to hide in case of disaster.

The front gate did not open onto the street. What faced the street was a sundry-goods shop—outwardly an ordinary oil-and-salt store serving the neighborhood's wealthy households, but actually arranged by Master Gao. Beside the shop was an inconspicuous side door, with an alley leading directly to the house—very convenient for coming and going.

Servants were on hand to care for the house; seeing the master bring guests, they hurried to boil water and serve tea.

"Those of us in the overseas trade must be exceedingly cautious!" Master Gao sighed. "Making a living is not easy."

Smuggling meant dealing with all sorts of unsavory characters—pirates, river bandits, mountain brigands—all the kind who would kill for money. Kidnapping, extortion, murder, and robbery were not unusual in this line of work.

Though they had backing in the prefectural, provincial, and capital governments, officials were greedy and often made demands. Moreover, the court was inherently suspicious of overseas trade, and there were periodic proposals to ban Portuguese trade with Guangzhou. Local high officials frequently used this threat to squeeze merchants.

"All that is still manageable. What troubles us most is the recent surge in pirates. Foreign and Chinese ships alike have suffered greatly, and our livelihoods have grown difficult."

Xiao Zishan thought this was a good opportunity to gather intelligence on the current state of piracy along the Guangdong-Fujian coast. He feigned ignorance:

"Sailing from Australia, we found the route quite peaceful."

"That is your good fortune." Master Gao smiled bitterly. "Still, compared to Fujian and Zhejiang, this area is relatively calm. Haicheng has been utterly devastated."

Since the second year of Tianqi, pirates along the Fujian-Guangdong coast had been recruiting followers and forming confederacies, declaring themselves kings. The most powerful were Yang Liu, Cai San, and Zhong Liu. In the sixth year of Tianqi, Fujian's Regional Commander Yu Zigao and the Guangdong naval forces mounted a joint suppression campaign; they pacified Yang Liu, while Cai San and Zhong Liu fled abroad. This temporarily curbed the pirates' momentum.

Yet before long, Zheng Zhilong, Zhong Lingxiu, Li Kuiqi, and other pirate fleets resumed raiding the Fujian-Zhejiang coast. Fujian's coast suffered most severely; Yuegang in Haicheng County—China's largest export trade port since the Longqing opening—was left in ruins. Ships heading overseas from there, fearing pirate attacks, had dwindled greatly.

"Here in Guangzhou, things have been quiet since last year's joint campaign by Fujian's Commander Yu and our provincial navy. The Portuguese, because their interests lie in Macau, also patrol the river mouth."

So at this time, pirate activity was concentrated along the Fujian coast. This information greatly boosted their confidence—at least at the outset, they wouldn't be facing BOSS-level figures like Zheng Zhilong or Li Kuiqi.

"Still, caution is best." Gao Ju reminded them: though Guangdong's coast had no major pirates, small pirate and bandit gangs were as numerous as hairs on an ox. They were strangers here; mooring and disembarking required particular care.
