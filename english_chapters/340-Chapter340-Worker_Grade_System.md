# Chapter 340 - Worker Grade System

"Specific details can be found in the documents sent to each ministry and commission office. Everyone can submit your opinions to the Ministry of Education's OA after reading."

"Leaving schools aside, isn't it time to organize worker grading?" Zhan Wuya, the representative of the Industrial and Energy Committee, said.

Wu De touched his forehead: "I actually forgot about this! You are right; the Ministry of Education wants to work on diplomas, and professional titles must also be grasped!"
    
The current wage distribution system had wage standards uniformly formulated by the Labor Affairs Office under the Civil Affairs Committee, and then uniformly issued through the Delong Grain Bank. There were only three or four grades of staff wages; people got paid about the same regardless of what they did. Under this system, the difficulty of work content could not be reflected, nor could income grades be widened.

Zhan Wuya nodded: "Job title ranks are very useful for incentivizing workers to learn technology and make progress. Moreover, the next step involves wage schemes. Without grades, we can only go by seniority, which easily causes dissatisfaction."

"Capable people can't get better treatment, while everyone just muddles along for seniority, right?" Wu De naturally knew this situation.

"Yes. Now there are over a thousand workers under the Industrial and Energy Committee. This matter must be put on the agenda." Zhan Wuya took out a roll of paper from his bag, "This is a technical grade scheme for workers under the Industrial and Energy Committee that we formulated ourselves."

Under this system, an industrial worker started as an apprentice. During the apprenticeship, no wages were paid, only a small amount of pocket money. Upon completion of the apprenticeship and passing the skills assessment, one became a Helper. A Helper was not a regular worker and only received a "Labor Allowance" equivalent to fifty percent of a regular worker's wage. After working as a Helper for a full year, passing the skills assessment, and holding a Type C Diploma simultaneously, one could be promoted to Level 1 Regular Worker.

Once becoming a regular worker, one entered the formal salary system. What he received was no longer "pocket money" and "allowance," but a formal wage. The treatment also improved significantly. In the future, as long as he worked hard and kept the defective product rate below the standard line, he could be promoted one level every year. Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, promoting up like this. For every promotion, the wage increased by a certain amount. Up to Level 4 Worker. Going further up required technical exams.

A Level 4 Worker passing the skills assessment and holding a Type B Diploma could be promoted to Technician. Technicians had four levels, but every level required passing an exam. Exams were held once a year.

Above Level 4 Technician, holding a Type A Diploma, one could participate in the Assistant Engineer assessment. Obtaining Assistant Engineer was the end point for most technicians; only Assistant Engineers who passed the Secondary School Diploma exam could participate in the Engineer assessment.

According to Zhan Wuya's calculation: a naturally intelligent indigenous worker with strong hands-on ability and eagerness to learn would take about ten years at the fastest to be promoted to Assistant Engineer. As for Engineer, it depended on his learning ability. Ordinary workers could probably only test up to Level 3 or 4 Technician.

Wu De looked at the entire plan and felt it was okay, so he said: "Is it going to be submitted to the Executive Committee for discussion?"

"Not yet. I am soliciting opinions privately now. Everyone, please give your comments. Human resources are under your leadership, so I especially want to ask for your views."

"Alright," Wu De said, "I don't understand worker grade systems much. However, do you plan to have a 'one size fits all' approach or separate by job type?"

A look of admiration appeared on Zhan Wuya's face: "Of course, by job type."

If not by job type, and all workers got paid by grade regardless of work, workers in high-tech and high-danger jobs would lose out too much. A Level 3 Packer and a Level 3 Lathe Operator were obviously not on the same level. But technical content wasn't the only factor to consider. Although stevedores on the dock had little technical content, theirs was extra-heavy physical labor, requiring much more grain rations than lathe operators.

"Different job types have different starting salary levels." Zhan Wuya said. Of course, this was a complex matter. It would be unrealistic for Zhan Wuya or anyone in the Transmigration Group to do it from scratch. Fortunately, they had plenty of historical experience—materials and regulations of this kind could be consulted in the Grand Library, and just needed modification according to the real environment.

"No matter what job type, the average income level of an industrial worker should at least be able to support a basic household of four."

A heavy physical labor worker needed between 3500 to 4000 kilocalories of heat daily. if strictly ingesting carbohydrates, each person needed at least twenty kilograms of grain. Equivalent to the Lingao Grain Circulation Coupons they issued now, it was 40 Yuan.

His wife—ancient southern farm women were not inferior to men in working, and Hainan women were famous for doing heavy, tiring, and hard work—would require at least fifteen kilograms of grain.

Assuming two dependents, calculated at twelve kilograms of grain per person per month. His wage would be 40 + 30 + 48, totaling: 118 Yuan Lingao Grain Circulation Coupons.

Of course, if there was really only this much, the family could only eat to stay alive. However, the transmigrators' labor policy was that women should also work. The wage income earned by women could be used for other expenses, such as buying clothes, purchasing daily necessities, buying some fish and meat, etc. If children or elderly in the family could also work, income could be further increased. This could stimulate more labor to actively enter the market. Life wouldn't be destitute either—transmigrators didn't want their people to be so poor they couldn't afford any consumer goods.

"When I was on naval vessels in the past, comrades would encounter a problem when promoting—professional rank restriction. Do you understand what I mean?" Wu De said—every professional post on a vessel had a maximum military rank. To be promoted to a higher rank, one had to switch professional posts.

"We considered this too. Depending on the technical content of the job type, the maximum promotion level for each job type is different." Zhan Wuya said, "Job types with very low technical content don't have Technician levels, let alone Engineers—unless he is willing to change to another job type..." According to Zhan Wuya's idea, this could incentivize workers to learn new technologies.

"You are being a bit idealistic here. When workers reach a certain age, marry and have children, and burdens become heavy, how easy is it to ask them to change professions and posts! Will this create a batch of low-skill workers hovering in the low-income group for a long time?"

"This is also unavoidable." Zhan Wuya considered and said, "We are not here to engage in egalitarianism, nor a socialist big family. It is necessary to widen income brackets according to ability levels."

"Mm, so we have to grasp this degree. Don't unconsciously fall into the idea of a welfare society." Wu De said, "Treatment cannot be too low; too low affects the physical health of employees and the next generation of laborers, and also affects labor efficiency. It also cannot be too high. 'It is easy to go from frugality to extravagance, but hard to go from extravagance to frugality.'"

Transmigrators couldn't turn stone into gold. Advanced technology didn't mean it could be directly translated into wealth. The primitive accumulation of this new nation had to rely on external plunder and internal exploitation just the same.

Zhan Wuya suddenly felt a chill on his back: "To be honest, I'm quite unaccustomed to it."

"Unaccustomed to speaking so nakedly? Hehe." Wu De laughed, "This shows one point: our petty-bourgeois sentiments are still too many." He added: "However, low-income families must also be taken care of well. Provide more basic welfare. Actually, sometimes small favors are more useful than raising wages."

"This..." Zhan Wuya couldn't say what small favors besides distributing money and things could be given to workers. Seeing Wu De's appearance, he seemed to have a plan in mind. He thought that anyway this matter was within Wu De's responsibility; he just needed to follow instructions.

Wu De's labor welfare plan was in a Sacred Ship brand notebook in his pocket. Besides this, there was a more specific labor system plan. His notebook was full of various key points and ideas. Whenever he was free, he took it out to ponder. Although these plans couldn't be implemented now due to objective conditions, the veins were gradually becoming clear. Once the time was ripe, he prepared to submit them to the Executive Committee.

"Hippo, that guy! Went to inspect hygiene and never came back! Could he know what I am doing? And He Ping, came back from the voyage with a few days off to rest, and simply rested until he vanished!" Shi Niaoren hadn't seen them for several nights when conducting "professional study" watching AVs.

"If they don't watch, fine. Let them regret not seeing Little Sora's 'Infantry' (uncensored) film!" He comforted himself while fishing out a chaotic mixture.

"AV varieties are really numerous; Little Sora's skills are really exciting!" Shi Niaoren recalled the grandeur of yesterday's professional study nightlife while his hands and feet didn't stop numbering those balls of mixture.

"This is the 30th sample, the last one." Shi Niaoren performed microscopy with grief and indignation, "This sample really stinks." saying this, he glanced at the petri dish next to him, which contained the culture specimen of the poop from the immigrant who kicked the bucket early in the morning. In a while, he had to check carefully if there were curved bacilli. Thinking of this, he couldn't help checking if his mask was in the proper position.

The immigrant who died suddenly in the morning was still parked in the underground morgue—the temperature there was slightly lower. But it couldn't be kept for long. Shi Niaoren had to confirm quickly if he died of some epidemic disease. If not, there was still time to organize an autopsy at night; otherwise, it had to be pulled out for cremation quickly—this stinking matter was again the Health Department's business. He sighed; he had already quarreled with the high levels of the Executive Committee regarding corpse disposal. The Executive Committee seemed to think the sea was a natural body dumping ground, suggesting he send people to Bopu to dump bodies. But he pointed out many times that the Health Department needed a dedicated incinerator to burn various medical wastes and deceased suspected of infectious diseases. Now pulling them directly to open ground to burn polluted the environment and didn't burn cleanly. It was simply creating sources of pathogen transmission.
