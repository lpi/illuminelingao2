# Chapter 126 - Trip to Guangzhou (2)

After a trial run, it was found that the ship speed could reach about 12 knots under full sail and downwind. Installing the engine didn't increase the speed much. However, the maneuverability of the ship was greatly improved, which was good news for the transmigrators who had no experience in operating hard-sail ships.

"At least our ship will have a great advantage in headwinds." Lin Shenhe summarized this advantage.

Besides the power system, the ship also underwent a series of modification measures, including installing a radio station and adding living cabins. The bulkheads of the cargo hold were reinforced, and several hidden compartments were modified. Besides weapons and ammunition, Lin Shenhe's private goods were also loaded inside, prepared for use when moonlighting as pirates.

Including the transmigrators, the total number of personnel going to Guangzhou for purchasing was twenty-five. To guard against pirate attacks, the ship was fully stocked with weapons and ammunition, as well as plenty of dry rations, fresh water, silver money, and various materials.

On November 1, 1628, the sixth day of the tenth lunar month in the first year of Chongzhen of the Ming Dynasty, on a sunny and breezy day, the Third-Class Transport Ship "Dengyingzhou" (Ascending Yingzhou) weighed anchor and set sail from Bopu, heading towards the sunlit sea.

This majestic-sounding "Third-Class Transport Ship Dengyingzhou" was purely the fantasy of a group of people with strong navy complexes. As for why it was a "Third-Class Transport Ship" instead of second or fourth class, only they knew.

The Dengyingzhou picked up Liu Gang at Denglongjiao in Xuwen. This small salt merchant also brought a few bodyguards and assistants. He originally refused to take a boat to Guangzhou, preferring the safer land route. But hearing that the short-hairs had sharp firearms, he probably felt secure. It was just a slight regret not seeing the legendary big iron ship.

The journey was smooth and uneventful. Five days later, they arrived at the wharf outside the south city of Guangzhou.

The Pearl River Estuary in 1628 was not as busy with shipping as in later generations. Pirates had been rampant recently, and there were rumors that Governor Yu wanted to blockade ships to fight Liu Laoxiang (Liu Xiang), so various foreign ships all fled. Ships on the Pearl River were scarce.

Lin Chuanqing didn't sleep very peacefully these few days. This trip to Guangzhou carried some risks more or less. He used to be a snakehead in the South China Sea organizing smuggling and had seen all kinds of big winds and waves, but after all, he had washed his hands of it for a long time. Although this group of North American branch personnel was always ready to find an opportunity to make a score on the sea, he was also most afraid of encountering pirate ships: Was a huge sea bandit like Liu Laoxiang easy to mess with? When Lin Chuanqing was a snakehead, he knew it didn't matter which country's patrol boat a smuggling ship met; at worst, the business couldn't be done. But encountering pirates meant everything was over.

Once they encountered Liu Xiang's pirate ships, the lives of everyone on this ship would depend entirely on these dozen guns and the two newly installed diesel engines. Everyone lacked experience in sea combat. One or two pirate ships might be manageable, but what if seventeen or eighteen came...

Fortunately, Liu Gang brought a helmsman familiar with the coastal route. Under his guidance, they sailed cautiously along the coastline all the way, entering bays to hide whenever they saw suspicious ships. Stopping and going like this was already very difficult. Now that they had endured until the Pearl River Estuary, he could finally sleep well. Thinking deeply, he looked back at Guo Yi at the other end of the railing and couldn't help smiling bitterly again.

For Guo Yi, this five-day sea journey was full of suffering. Since being transferred to the Public Security Group to do interrogation and screening work, his life had some new hope. Being entrusted with the heavy responsibility of serving as the head of the Guangzhou underground forward station this time was a qualitative leap for him personally—he had been recognized. Although this task was full of risks, high risk meant high return—he would use his professional knowledge to rapidly improve his status in the transmigration group, thereby entering the upper echelons of the group. Excited, Guo Yi prepared a full set of plans and schemes, running towards the ideal new world with hope.

Although he was prepared for seasickness before, the journey originally planned for one or two days dragged on to the fifth day without stepping on land because of hiding here and there. Guo Yi's face also turned from red to white, white to green, green to black... He never knew he was seasick—obviously, this 78-ton wooden boat was not the same thing as a thousand-ton big ship. What should be vomited had all been vomited in the wind and waves of the first three days. For the first time since passively transmigrating, a certain person had the thought of seeking death...

Fortunately, the most difficult moment had passed. Sailing peacefully like now, he could occasionally pretend to be calm and come out to breathe the sea breeze. For him, the test after landing was far more than just seasickness. This could be considered a small prelude given to him by fate.

"Wharf! Wharf!" Qian Shuixie's shout from the crow's nest stirred up the whole ship. People noisily squeezed to the railings on both sides to feast their eyes. Looking from the ship, a winding green ribbon extended towards the horizon. This was the Pearl River. In the distance was the majestic city wall of Guangzhou. Residential houses and forts scattered like chess pieces around could be seen with the naked eye. Several small sailing boats were moored in a scattered manner at the wharf. To prevent sneak attacks by pirates, fences had been set up around the wharf.

Stimulated by the hope of landing, everyone worked hard to dock the ship at the wharf. The fellows making a living on the wharf were mostly dark-skinned and thin. Seeing this group of people who appeared tall and strong due to sufficient nutrition in later generations, they gathered around in confusion to see what was happening. Meng De (Monde?) was the first to jump off the ship, followed by Qian Shuixie, Zhou Weisen, and others. Although everyone had dressed as Ming people and wore fake buns beforehand, so they wouldn't be easily seen through, military habits still made them quickly adopt an alert posture. Both sides confronted each other in such a strange atmosphere...

"Why not go ashore yet? What are you dawdling for?" A charming voice came from behind the cabin.

Everyone looked back and saw a stunning beauty lifting the cabin curtain and looking out. Her towering cloud-like hair bun seemed casually pinned on her head, but just right to let a few strands of hair hang on her slightly heaving chest, exuding an indescribable languid beauty. A bright and moving melon-seed face, with crystal-clear pink skin under the light gauze, surpassing snow and frost, better than hibiscus. A pair of brimming autumn waters (eyes), clear and blurred. Under the exquisite and straight nose were pink and tender red lips thin and tender like rose petals, full and dripping. Every frown and smile had ten thousand kinds of charm, truly breathtaking.

Meng De and his group were instantly stunned. The souls of those boatmen and fellows flew to who knows where, eyes wide open and mouths agape, two streams of drool flowing unconsciously. At this moment, even if they were finished off with a knife, it was estimated they wouldn't have any reaction.

At this time, a cough came from the cabin. Guo Yi came out, pretending to be experienced, cupped his hands and said: "Female family members, sorry to disturb, hope everyone forgives." After saying that, he drove the beauty back into the cabin to avoid further chaos.

This beauty was none other than the secret final decisive battle weapon of the transmigrators' famous Intelligence Group, PEPEI, codenamed "Miss P," whose true gender was listed as top secret. PEPEI's makeup skills were among the best even in modern times. During the journey on the ship, everyone had long been mesmerized by his dazzling continuous transformation from loli to shota to royal sister (older sister type). Now appearing again, even Meng De and others who thought they had immunity still couldn't resist, showing the depth of his skill.

Inside the cabin, Guo Yi reproached: "Miss P, hope you understand. Although you are directly appointed by the Intelligence and Data Group of the Executive Committee, I am the person in charge of the Guangdong Forward Station after all, and have the power to coordinate uniformly. Hope you don't create difficulties for our overall operation." Guo Yi understood that PEPEI was the most important secret weapon in this Guangzhou operation, but in any case, he couldn't affect the realization of the overall plan, so it was necessary to remind him again.

PEPEI smiled charmingly and said: "Why be so serious? Didn't expect those natives to be so easy to deal with. A bit of a waste of my skills." Guo Yi pondered slightly and said: "Now the intelligence station will be established according to plan. The construction of frontline intelligence strongholds will also be put on the agenda immediately. However, whether restaurants or inns, we still have some problems with manpower. But I will try to solve it. Before that, hope you can stay on the ship all the time to avoid any mistakes. After all, this kind of thing is not suitable for you to show your face." PEPEI smiled slightly, considered nodding in agreement.

Xiao Zishan said: "Let's discuss the actions after going ashore now." He was the leader of the purchasing group but was only responsible for contacting Gao Ju and purchasing various items needed by the industrial department. As for the work of establishing the forward station, Guo Yi was fully responsible.

"We act separately. Committee Member Xiao, you go talk about cooperation with Gao Ju and Shopkeeper Sun—after all, you are acquaintances. I plan to ask Liu Gang to take Old Yan and me to look at the market in Guangzhou and calculate about opening a shop. Others stay on the ship for the time being."

"I'll go back to the residence first, then send sedan chairs and mule carts to pick everyone up to the residence to relax. Bei Wei knows Sun Chang; let him lead the team." Xiao Zishan knew this group of people had been stifled on the ship for five or six days. If they continued to stay on the ship, they might cause some trouble, so he kept Bei Wei to control the scene.

After everyone settled the plan and reorganized slightly, Xiao Zishan set off into Guangzhou City under the protection of two groups of people: special forces and North Americans.

Xiao Zishan was revisiting an old haunt, feeling somewhat intimate. Others were completely curious. Most people hadn't even been to Lingao County Town. Now suddenly arriving at the most prosperous commercial city in South China at that time, the word "dazzled" was very appropriate to describe it.

But now was not the time for sightseeing. Returning to the residence on Huifu Street, everything remained the same with the steward Sun Chang and the Gao family who stayed behind. They were very happy to see the master return. In the more than a year they left, the residence had been repaired decently: the courtyard walls and revetments were renovated, rubble was cleared, and houses were repaired. A vegetable garden was also opened in the garden, planting many vegetables.
