Chapter 64 Fighting Bravely

The battle against the Huang Family Stockade began.

This was the first time the Transmigrators attacked a fortified target.

The Huang Family Stockade was built on a hillside, surrounded by high walls and trenches, easy to defend and hard to attack.

Xi Yazhou deployed the troops carefully.

"Artillery platoon, bombard the gate!"
"Infantry, cover the charge!"
"Snipers, kill the enemy commanders!"

"Fire!"

"Boom! Boom!"

Napoleon cannons roared. Solid shots hit the gate of the stockade, smashing it into pieces.

"Charge!"

The soldiers rushed into the stockade like a tide.

The militia of the Huang family resisted desperately. They shot arrows and threw stones from the walls.

However, in front of the modern firepower of the Transmigrators, their resistance was futile.

"Da da da!" SKS rifles swept across. The militia on the walls were suppressed and couldn't raise their heads.

"Bang!" Snipers killed the leader of the militia with one shot.

The defense line of the Huang Family Stockade collapsed.

Huang Shoutong, seeing the situation was hopeless, committed suicide with a sword in the ancestral hall.

The Transmigrators occupied the Huang Family Stockade.

They confiscated the property of the Huang family and distributed the grain to the local poor peasants.

"Long live the Australian masters!" The poor peasants cheered.

This battle completely deterred the local forces in Lingao. No one dared to openly oppose the Transmigrators anymore.

The road construction project resumed and proceeded smoothly.

A few days later, the road to Bailaren Beach was opened.
