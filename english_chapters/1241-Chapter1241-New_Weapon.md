# Chapter 1241 - New Weapon

Li Huamei realized that in this instant, she had truly become a commander without troops. Although Li Ying hadn't been with her long and couldn't be counted as a trusted confidant, she was at least someone Li Huamei had personally won over. Now, assigned this smiling "female orderly," it went without saying that the Australians were monitoring her.

Thinking of her crew sent to the "quarantine camp"—given the Australians' skill at bewitching hearts, would they still be loyal to her when they came out?

Li Huamei suddenly recalled that terrifying feeling from a moment ago—being watched while bathing, naked and exposed with nowhere to hide.

Having reached this point, she could only take things as they came. She consoled herself: to earn trust, one always had to pay a price.

She was assigned a double room in the single officers' dormitory at the Zuooying Naval Base. Since she was the only female officer, she legitimately had the room to herself, which was convenient.

However, her freedom was limited to this space of less than eight square meters. Opening the window, she could see patrolling sentries in the base and a forest of masts in the harbor. Although she could move freely within most of the base, she couldn't leave Zuooying Base without leave, and the leave process involved so many rules she simply gave up on the idea.

*It's practically jail,* Li Huamei thought.

However, amidst this helplessness, there was some good news. First, her modification plan for the *Hangzhou*, rejected in Lingao, was approved in Kaohsiung. This included improvements to ship handling and increased firepower—except for the slightly complex installation of a ship's wheel, the modifications were relatively simple. The Kaohsiung shipyard could handle them.

Secondly, seemingly to relieve her boredom, on her third day in camp she was notified to attend "Surface Vessel Officer Training."

The training took place within the Zuooying Base, attended entirely by naturalized naval officers of the First Fleet. At first, Li Huamei sneered at this training. She had drifted on the sea for many years and encountered all sorts of people and events, but she had never heard that naval battles could be won by sitting at a desk, moving small models around a sand table. Let alone listening to them lecture on navigation theory—were there any Australians better at sailing than she was?

But this was an excellent opportunity to probe the Australians' secrets. For this reason, she acted very proactively. She was the first to arrive at the classroom every day. Soon, she was attracted by something: a picture album. Beautifully bound. It was kept on a dedicated reading stand in the classroom, and one had to wear gloves to browse it.

The paper of the album was hard and thick, heavy in her arms. Inside were drawings of various ships she had seen, hadn't seen, heard of, or never heard of. Each ship was marked in detail with its name, nationality, and specific data, including tonnage, sail type, speed, armament, and crew complement—densely packed but orderly.

What shocked her most were the large three-view and cutaway drawings of the ships, detailing the structural and internal details of each vessel type. Li Huamei couldn't believe the Australians could depict every detail of a ship so intuitively on paper. She knew Europeans had very detailed plans for shipbuilding, but those were secrets kept by shipwrights and owners; ordinary people could never access them.

Since this book wasn't allowed out of the conference room, on class days she would run over early to flip through it. She looked entranced at the ships of all sizes and types, secretly hoping that one day she could own a ship of her own from this album.

Later on, what shocked her wasn't just a picture album. The Australian on the podium, using a mass of difficult terminology, diagrams drawn on a black board, and a few simple small models, led her into a world she had never known. And she would never have guessed that in the near future, what she heard in this classroom would draw a completely different trajectory for her life.

Every day during lectures, the rumble of cannon fire could be heard intermittently. No one paid it much mind: Kaohsiung had assembled many warships. Originally, there was already much traffic here, with ships constantly entering and leaving port. But now, although traffic remained frequent, the *Lichun* and several steam-powered gunboats hadn't sortied again. They only occasionally went out to the waters near Kaohsiung for live-fire exercises, returning at most the next day.

But on this day, the instructor in charge announced that all trainees would go observe an amphibious landing exercise by the Marines.

The amphibious landing exercise took place on a beach outside Zuooying Base. Participating were several warships of the First Fleet, plus many Daihatsu, Chuhatsu, and Shohatsu landing craft.

Standard beach landing mode: Special Reconnaissance Teams marked targets and landing points on shore, destroying the command center; ships approached to bombard the beach; troops transferred to landing craft, stormed the beach, controlled the port, unloaded artillery... Every link connected perfectly, dazzling to behold.

For someone like Li Huamei, although she came with the intent of gathering intelligence, the gap in knowledge made her sensitivity to intelligence too low. Consequently, she could only watch the exercise for the spectacle. Although she saw many novel gadgets and special tactics she wouldn't normally see, which she found fresh and shocking, she didn't discern any deeper clues from them.

However, observing the landing exercise allowed her to clearly reach a conclusion: the Australians would launch a landing operation soon. The target was likely Zheng Zhilong.

This intelligence was important. But she had no way to pass it to her sister, and besides, the survival of the Zheng family didn't matter much to her. And looking at the earth-swallowing momentum of the Australian army and navy, who would win and who would lose wasn't much of a suspense. Even the young miss wouldn't bet on a force destined for doom.

She remembered a few months ago, the young miss had said to her: "Liu Xiang is finished. Sooner or later he'll be destroyed by Zheng Zhilong and the Australians. We don't need to do business with him anymore." Now she could say: "The Zheng family is finished; sooner or later they'll be destroyed by the Australians. We don't need to do business with them anymore."

For the Senate members in Kaohsiung, this landing exercise meant that full-scale war against the Zheng family was imminent. The transfer of two Special Reconnaissance Teams before summer was for preliminary intelligence gathering; the transfer of the Marines from Hong Kong now meant formal combat troops were in place.

Shi Zhiqi arrived quietly in Kaohsiung, bringing with him a newly formed Marine unit from Hong Kong, publicly designated the "Shi Detachment," officially the 1st Expeditionary Force of the Marines—this expeditionary force was new in organization, and its weapons were new too.

The entire Marine Corps was no longer equipped with the Fubo Army's standard Minié rifles, but a brand-new, more powerful rifle: the Hall breech-loading rifle.

The Hall breech-loading rifle was an early version of a breech-loader: this gun had a breech block that could be lifted. When loading, the paper cartridge was placed whole into the breech, then closed. The percussion cap was placed on the nipple. Effectively, it was a metal cartridge case fixed to the gun.

The breech-loading rifle's rate of fire was much faster than a muzzle-loader. The downside was gas leakage at the breech, reducing range and power compared to the theoretically inferior muzzle-loading rifle—in fact, before the invention of the metal cartridge, all breech-loading rifles had this problem. However, against 17th-century enemies lacking effective long-range projectile weapons, this wasn't a big issue. Secondly, the Machinery Department indicated that this problem could be mitigated by improving machining precision, using brass wedge-shaped mating surfaces, and curved locking mechanisms—after all, always manufacturing uniform Minié rifles bored the machinery people. Those in this line of work all had some urge to make weapons, wanting to create higher-end equipment.

But the idea of enjoying the speed of a breech-loader without metal cartridges was very tempting: Although the Minié ball solved the difficulty of loading, the loading method of the muzzle-loading rifle remained unchanged: tear open the bottom of the paper cartridge, pour the propellant from the muzzle into the barrel, use the ramrod to push the bullet in, press down the hammer, place the cap on the nipple, aim, pull the trigger. The 2-3 rounds/minute rate of fire of muzzle-loaders referred to this method. In emergencies, the entire paper cartridge could be rammed into the bore, capped, and fired directly, but since the propellant was wrapped in paper, this increased the rate of hang fires or misfires. This happened frequently in training and combat. By contrast, the breech-loading rifle using paper cartridges could reach a rate of fire of 7-10 rounds/minute. using higher quality granular black powder, the Hall rifle could even fire over thirty rounds continuously without cleaning the chamber. This was an advantage over the Minié rifle.

Of course, the biggest benefit was that the Minié rifles widely equipped by the Army and Navy could be easily converted to Hall rifles by modifying the rear of the receiver, without requiring major adjustments to the production line—except for a few parts requiring slightly higher machining precision than the Minié rifle, the basic production performance was close.

Although the technological leap of the Hall rifle wasn't large, only a small step in military industrial development, the cost of crossing this small step wasn't high, while the power could be multiplied. This fit perfectly with the Executive Committee's philosophy of low-cost improvement.

After Lin Shenhe's constant lobbying and promotion, this small-scale improvement measure was finally implemented before Operation Engine, and a batch of rifles was converted on a small scale: all equipped to the Marines. Shi Zhiqi's proposal to create an experimental Marine unit with independent amphibious strike capabilities based on the Hong Kong Detachment coincided with Lin Shenhe's proposal to establish a new standard model test unit.
