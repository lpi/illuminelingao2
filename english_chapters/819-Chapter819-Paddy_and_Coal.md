# Chapter 819 - Paddy and Coal

Zhu Fuyuan reported the current situation to Yan Maoda. Dachang's operations locally didn't require the manager to be particularly skilled at business: every month, Vu Ngoc Giap's stewards would bring servants and farmers from the estate to deliver rice, timber, and coal, and haul away various sugar products and sundry goods from the warehouse. The transaction volume was large.

"Vu Ngoc Giap has made a fortune from this business," Zhu Fuyuan said with a hint of envy. "He's making big money on our sugar."

Vu Ngoc Giap bought crude brown sugar from Dachang at 8 Spanish silver dollars per *dan*, then resold it to Laos, Siam, and the Dutch, selling a *dan* for 10 to 18 Spanish dollars. The profits on white sugar and rock sugar were even higher. As for other goods shipped from Leizhou—including "Aussie goods" made in Lingao and various daily sundries acquired from the mainland—they were all hot items locally.

Seeing his own goods being bought by Vu Ngoc Giap and resold for huge profits, Zhu Fuyuan felt unbalanced. He proposed expanding their customer base and sales channels—preferably into retail—so the benefits wouldn't be monopolized by the Vu family alone.

"No rush on that," Yan Maoda said. "How are the paddy deliveries?"

"Arrived. The paddy agreed upon last year has all been delivered," Zhu Fuyuan said hurriedly. "But Vu Ngoc Giap's steward wants to raise prices again."

Hearing Vu Ngoc Giap wanted to raise prices again, Yan Maoda frowned. This was the third request for a price hike on paddy in the last six months. Paddy was a strategic material for Lingao, and Vietnam was currently Lingao's main supplier. A price hike not only meant paying more barter goods but also signaled potential problems in the supply channel.

"Why raise prices again? There must be a reason," Yan Maoda said. "Could the stewards be playing tricks?"

"He wouldn't dare—our business with Vu Ngoc Giap is huge; a steward doesn't have the guts to mess around," Zhu Fuyuan said. "The steward says it's because the Trinh clan is marching south to punish the Nguyen clan, recruiting soldiers and requisitioning grain everywhere. Vu Ngoc Giap naturally has to contribute a large sum for provisions and pay. They say that to get enough paddy, the farmers on Vu Ngoc Giap's estate are starving—last spring they ate thin gruel; this spring they're eating chaff." Zhu Fuyuan added, "I hear some farmers can't go on and are preparing to flee the estate."

The war Zhu Fuyuan referred to was the Later Le Dynasty's Trinh-Nguyen War. This conflict began in 1627 and lasted for over a century. Between 1627 and 1672, seven massive battles erupted between the Trinh and Nguyen. The Elders were encountering the second major war, from 1630 to 1633. The Nguyen clan fully utilized a turtle strategy, inflicting heavy losses on the southward-marching Trinh army with fortress complexes built under Portuguese guidance. A strategic stalemate formed.

Under such conditions, large numbers of farmers were inevitably conscripted. In a medieval agricultural society, farmers were the most important productive force; without labor to till the fields, sufficient food couldn't be produced.

"That's terrible." Yan Maoda thought relying on Vu Ngoc Giap for long-term bulk grain supply would be difficult. If they didn't intervene, the Later Le Dynasty's civil war would drag on for another 50 years according to history.

"Once fighting starts, food is hard to get," Zhu Fuyuan said nervously. Having worked for the Aussies in Haiyang for over a year, he knew their main purpose here was buying grain. If grain was too expensive or hard to buy, they might not keep the warehouse open. His hard-won good job would be gone.

"Accept the price for paddy," Yan Maoda said after some thought. "How much grain can he deliver per month now? Any sign of decrease?"

"No paddy delivered this past month. He said the government requisitioned a lot. Stocks on the estate are insufficient," Zhu Fuyuan said. "And the next three months are the spring hunger season. Once past spring hunger, grain supply should normalize."

Zhu Fuyuan added, "Chief! Should we slow down sugar shipments? We have over ten thousand *dan* of sugar piled in the warehouse..."

"No matter!" Yan Maoda said. "Tell Vu Ngoc Giap's steward tomorrow: if there's no rice, sell us more coal instead!"

"Trade for coal?" Zhu Fuyuan was startled; to him, this was a bad deal. Although coal was very cheap, seeing the Aussies buy shiploads of dirty, smelly burning rocks, he found it hard to understand—in both Guangdong and Vietnam, firewood was cheap and plentiful, and rich families could use high-quality hardwood charcoal. He really couldn't figure out why the Aussies bought so much black coal.

"Yes, since he doesn't have enough rice for now, swap the stockpiled sugar for coal and timber." Yan Maoda waved his hand. "Don't dawdle, get it done immediately!"

Zhu Fuyuan answered "Yes" repeatedly. Seeing Yan Maoda had nothing else to say, he immediately presented the warehouse ledgers. Yan Maoda accepted them first—auditing was the Cheka's job, but as the superior, he needed to do his own checks. He planned to read them on the way to Hongji.

"This is Bei Kai." Yan Maoda introduced Bei Kai to Zhu Fuyuan. "He will be the Commercial Representative to Vietnam from now on. Report directly to him if anything comes up!"

Bei Kai's station was Hongji, but as the Elder Commercial Representative, he would technically have authority over Haiyang and future trading posts and warehouses along the Vietnamese coast.

Zhu Fuyuan glanced at this dark, short man—he looked just like those Vietnamese, how could he be a Chief too? But having worked as a shop assistant for years, he knew the rule of speaking less and executing more regarding the owner's personnel arrangements.

"How about the matter I asked you to investigate last time? Any specific update?" Yan Maoda asked.

Last time Yan Maoda came to Haiyang, he specifically instructed Zhu Fuyuan to investigate the ownership of the Hongji area: did it belong to some estate owner, was it salary land for Le Dynasty officials, or was it ownerless government land?

"I've asked around specifically. Hongji, and Cam Pha which the Chief mentioned, are ownerless lands. It's either mountains or tidal flats, untillable, so no one cares about it."

"What's the procedure to buy land from the government here?"

Zhu Fuyuan smiled bitterly: "Probably very difficult. Ming merchants are fat sheep here; even buying a plot for a warehouse takes a lot of trouble. Money is secondary." He paused. "If the Chief insists on buying it, we must first mark out the boundaries and draw a map, then I can run around... but I'm afraid it will cost a lot..."

"No need. We'll talk when we get back." Yan Maoda thought they might not need to buy it. backed by force, mining on the spot—the Northern Le Dynasty probably had no mind to mobilize a large army against them right now.

Yan Maoda's group didn't stay long in Haiyang. After inspecting the warehouse and understanding the basic local situation, the *Zhennan* offloaded its cargo and set sail south again for Hongji.

Haiyang was about 60 kilometers from Hongji. The *Zhennan* could reach it in about 10 hours. Because they were sailing along the coast and Hongji was in Halong Bay, which was full of islands and reefs, Zhang Dabala decided not to sail at night but to leave early in the morning to arrive in the evening.

The *Zhennan* set sail early. Zhang Dabala made a show of taking observations with a sextant and plotting the course on a chart. Unfortunately, his arithmetic was too poor; after fiddling with a nautical slide rule for half a day, he finally threw it down with a curse of "Bird!" and went back behind the poop deck to recite compass bearings.

Fortunately, this was a route he traveled often—a place where he could supposedly sail with his eyes closed. Under his command, the *Zhennan* began sailing south.

The *Zhennan* sailed smoothly under Zhang Dabala's command. The Chinese junk rig fully demonstrated its superiority in adapting to "winds from eight directions" when sailing in coastal areas with complex winds. Although speed varied, they never stopped.

Bei Kai stood on the poop deck gazing at the beautiful coastal scenery, feeling his more than six months of hard Vietnamese study were worth it—this land was too tempting. If he could become Governor of North Vietnam in the future... Bei Kai's thoughts drifted to the slender Vietnamese women he saw in Haiyang yesterday.

In the Council of Elders, Bei Kai was an unremarkable "soy sauce" Elder. His past profession landed him in the Postal and Transport Commission, but he knew nothing about transport, and Lingao's postal system hadn't been formally established yet—and even if it were, he, a postal worker who used to sell ads, knew little about postal operations.

He wasn't a smooth talker and didn't like getting involved in politics. So he was a marginal figure in the Council. But the Transmigration Group's expansionist nature and the scarcity of Elders meant even "soy sauce" Elders had plenty of opportunities to shine.

While he was letting his imagination run wild about Vietnamese women, the ship's bell suddenly rang urgently. Bei Kai was startled. Sailors and marines poured out from below deck. Some held Navy Type 29 cutlasses, others short-barreled Minié rifles. Several sailors rushed to the poop deck, quickly stripping off oilcloth covers to reveal black typewriters [machine guns]. Someone rapidly opened a nearby metal box, taking out black spare drum magazines.

"What's happening?" Bei Kai was shocked, seeing cover after cover being stripped from the six carronades on deck. Was this a battle stance?

"Report: At 7 o'clock, ships engaging in combat. We're entering alert status first," Zhang Dabala rushed to the poop deck and explained.

"Pirates?"

"Likely." Zhang Dabala wasn't nervous. "Chiefs don't worry, this happens often around here. You can't tell fishermen from pirates. Our ship is big and alert; they won't dare try anything."
