# Chapter 781 – New Year's Reception

"Your telegram." A naturalized-citizen cadre from the General Office's confidential communications room placed a locked folder on Wu De's desk—this was how "Confidential" and higher telegrams and documents circulated among Executive Committee members, People's Commissioners, and ministers. They each had a special key.

Wu De opened the folder and took out the telegram. Stamped "Top Secret," it was from He Fanghui in Sanya. Of the three elders currently stationed there, he was the civilian-affairs chief.

The telegram reported that the first batch of Southeast Asian slaves had arrived. Landing count: 254. Physical condition: good. All were healthy adult males; no children or elderly.

*The Englishman actually delivered the slaves on schedule,* Wu De thought. Using Southeast Asian slaves was settled House policy, driven both by labor needs and future strategic considerations. Even if Quark hadn't come through, the Executive Committee had backup plans for other foreign merchants to fill the role.

He stamped his seal in the viewing-roster column at the bottom of the telegram, locked the folder again, and returned it to the courier. He opened a folder on his desk labeled "Labor Force." Inside were weekly statistical breakdowns of "disposable labor," categorized by age, sex, region, industry, and so on. Overall, adding 254 workers to the Sanya District—where 4,761 had been shipped in and 3,850 currently remained—wasn't a huge number. But slaves would drastically reduce the death rate among trained naturalized laborers: the most dangerous, heaviest work would now be borne entirely by slaves. After tasting success this trip, Quark would ship in an endless stream, fully meeting local labor demand and consumption.

Of course, labor demand was bottomless. With He Rubin's retreat, all of Hainan would fall under their control. The Planning Commission estimated population under House control would balloon to 400,000–600,000. But mobilizing them fully required extensive work: bandit suppression, village consolidation, household registration, population census. Even the most optimistic estimate said Qiongzhou's population couldn't be effectively utilized until early 1632. By contrast, indentured-contract immigrants and purchased slaves were far more convenient.

Beyond slaves, the Executive Committee was also seeking new population sources. Refugees from Guangdong and Fujian were nearly exhausted. Once again, the Committee turned to the Grand Library—looking for opportunities in the ceaseless natural disasters and man-made catastrophes of the late Ming.

*The idea is sound,* Wu De thought, *but the precondition is sufficient shipping capacity—and Liu Xiang, currently hiding who-knows-where…* Many technical details remained to be resolved.

As he was thinking, his private secretary Chu Yu entered with a red invitation.

"Whose invitation?" Wu De asked curiously. The only invitations that reached his desk were for elders' personal happy occasions—Yun Suji's invitation to marry Liu Meilan, niece of Liu Youren, chief of the Liu Family Stockade, had arrived yesterday. At the time, Wu De had fretted over whether to give a red envelope; he ultimately decided to buy a gift instead.

Chu Yu said, "Commissioner Wu's."

"Commissioner Wu?" Wu De paused, realizing she meant Wu Nanhai. Wu Nanhai was getting married? He immediately thought of the women at the farm.

"It's Chu Qing…" Chu Yu's voice held a hint of wistfulness—they shared the same origins. Watching a former sister become an elder's wife was bound to stir some sour feelings.

"Oh, yes, her." Wu De nodded noncommittally.

The 1631 New Year's reception, organized by Fang Fei and Zheng Shangjie, was held on schedule. Apart from essential duty personnel, most elders attended the event at Lingjiao Park. Beyond elders, local "collaborators" were invited—mostly members of the County Consultative Assembly and directors of the East Gate Market Commercial Association: Lin Quan'an, Liu Youren, Zhang Youfu, Li Sunqian… Even Fu Bu'er, a minor landlord who barely qualified, was invited as a "model" from the Tiandihui.

The remnants of the Ming bureaucracy in Lingao—Vice-Magistrate Wu Ya, Jail Warden Sun Ruiwu, Constable Fu Bowen, County School Instructor Wang Ci, and even the completely puppet Lingao magistrate Wu Mingjin—all received invitations. And Wang Zhaomin, who had contributed the most to the elders, was naturally on the list.

Besides this group—which Du Wen labeled "freaks and monsters"—there were representatives of naturalized citizens: outstanding individuals selected from soldiers, cadres, workers, cooperative members, and students. Liu Muzhou was planning a "Model Worker Selection" pageant after the new year. Of course, once model workers were involved, a "March Eighth Red Banner Bearer" designation probably couldn't be avoided—otherwise Du Wen wouldn't let him off.

Every invited native considered it a tremendous honor. The transmigrators' defeat of the imperial army and their expansion across all of Qiongzhou had given both high and low a premonition that "Heaven's mandate was changing." Both upper and lower classes teemed with people eager to board the Australian ship in these turbulent times and secure wealth for themselves and their clans. Nearly all invitees accepted. Even Wu Mingjin—who had maintained a posture of "neither surrender nor leave" and preached non-violent non-cooperation—arrived beaming in a sedan chair.

The reception began at 5:00 PM on December 31. Mu Min personally oversaw security arrangements at the venue. Though many natives were present—all either "activists" or rated "reliable" in security assessments—Mu Min knew this was no absolute guarantee. Security work had to be foolproof.

By the designated time, over 400 elders and roughly 100 elite figures of the transmigrators' "New Order" would gather in Lingjiao Park. Any casualties would deal a massive blow to the enterprise.

As the direct security chief for elders and the Green Zone, Mu Min coordinated with various departments at an internal-security meeting to finalize a protection plan. A first perimeter was set 50 meters outside Lingjiao Park, manned by Li Yayang's 2nd Company of the Lingao Garrison Battalion. A police unit composed of the Bopu Precinct and Fangcaodi's Police Training Class would maintain order and check IDs at the two park entrances.

Inside the park, the Special Reconnaissance Squad's Bopu Detachment would handle security and control all high points. Finally, agents from the General Bureau of Political Security formed the inner perimeter. At sea, naval patrol boats formed three lines, forbidding all vessels and persons within one nautical mile of the park's shoreline.

Beyond security, the reception had to account for fire and accident prevention—there were gas lamps, barbecue grills… Mu Min personally surveyed the terrain and convened several meetings, discussing venue layout, buffet-table placement, grill positions, evacuation routes, and even how much extra lighting to add.

Now everything was ready; they awaited only the guests. Lingjiao Park was decked with lanterns and streamers, gas lamps blazing. *Feiyun*, moored at the pier, was strung with festive lights. Loudspeakers played "Colorful Clouds Chasing the Moon" and "Spring Festival Overture," creating a lively, joyful atmosphere.

Guests arrived in twos and threes—some on foot, some in sedan chairs, some on bicycles—approaching the plaza before Lingjiao Park. This was already a second-tier security zone; no one without an invitation could enter. Liu Youren, beaming, arrived by sedan chair. Elder Xun had finally given a definite promise for the marriage to Liu Meilan. The matter that had hung in suspense for nearly a year was settled, and the Liu family's relationship with the elders could no longer be measured by the old standards. Stroking his beard, he gazed cheerfully at the bamboo-framed gate. This so-called "park" had always been restricted to elders, shrouded in mystery. Attending this "reception" and seeing it in person was exciting in itself.

Whistles sounded across the plaza as several police blew their whistles and ran about, directing each family's sedan chair into numbered "sedan slots" in orderly rows. Porters were led by attendants to temporary rest sheds. Liu Youren knew the Australian rules: only invitees themselves entered; servants were not allowed. He sent his attendants off to rest and headed for the gate, invitation in hand.

He had taken only a few steps when a middle-aged gentleman emerged from a two-man sedan. Peering closely—wasn't that Wu Mingjin? Long idle and well-fed, he had put on weight. A cloud-patterned cap on his head, dressed in a blue silk robe—the picture of a middle-class literatus.

Liu Youren immediately stepped forward and bowed in greeting. Wu Mingjin's Ming county-magistrate title was now empty; no special deference was required.

Wu Mingjin was very polite. He had long heard: the bald folk intended to take Liu Youren's grand-niece as a concubine. He privately scorned this bumpkin landlord but showed nothing on his face—these "new nobles" of the transmigrators were not to be offended.

"Is Your Honor also here for the reception?"

"Indeed," Wu Mingjin nodded. "Year's end, nothing to do—might as well enjoy myself."

"Year's end" referred to the "Great Song Calendar," i.e., the Gregorian calendar. By the concurrent *Great Ming Calendar*, the new year was still two months away. But under the elders' influence, Lingao had widely adopted the Gregorian calendar, gradually changing everyone's habits.

They were still chatting when a scholar in a blue-edged gown came puffing up nearby. Spotting Wu Mingjin, he immediately performed a deep formal bow, drawing glances from passersby.

"Your Honor! You're here too?" The newcomer was none other than County School Instructor Wang Ci. He had walked here; his forehead dripped sweat. His gown was tolerably neat but emanated the stale-sweat smell of old clothes.
