# Chapter 601 - Training

"Going on assignment means penetrating deep into enemy territory. Whether it's the Ming Dynasty, the Later Jin, or European colonizers—every one of them is an indigenous inhabitant of the 17th century. Don't try to judge their behavior and actions by 20th-century moral standards or codes of conduct. Here, on behalf of the Foreign Intelligence Bureau and the Colonial and Trade Superintendent, I'm announcing a 'Notice' outlining the risks you may encounter while executing your missions. It's better that you all understand these matters beforehand..."

Jiang Shan had insisted on preparing this notice. Yu Eshui opposed it. But in the end, they went ahead with Jiang Shan's intentions. His reasoning was simple: let's get the ugly truth out on the table first.

His intent was to fully spell out the difficulties and dangers of intelligence work, to fully inspire everyone's heroic spirit, and to prevent any grumbling later.

"Alright, alright, you're babbling on and on like an old woman," said a burly man sitting in the back row impatiently. "I signed up because I'm not afraid to die, so quit spouting all this empty talk..."

"It's still better that everyone knows. You should have some mental preparation for the situations you'll face." Wang Ding recalled this man's file. His name was Huang Hua, a native of Heilongjiang, who had originally worked in a machinery factory under the Manufacturing Superintendent. On his form, he stated his ambition was to serve as a station chief in Later Jin territory. His record noted that he'd done business, possessed a certain commercial acumen, understood mechanical technology, was familiar with the geography and customs of the lands beyond the passes, and knew some self-defense techniques. He could speak fluent Korean and even a bit of Shanxi dialect—quite a suitable candidate for work in Later Jin territory.

"This isn't about being afraid or not. Sometimes it might be worse than death." Wang Ding began reading the notice.

The general gist of the notice was: You are participating in dangerous work. First, you will experience the hardships of travel on miserable roads. Whether you travel by land or by water, you may encounter bandits. Unless you have the aura of a legendary commander who can make bandits prostrate themselves at the mere sight of you, your fate will be to die where you stand.

Local militiamen, yamen runners, and soldiers are hardly better than bandits. In certain places, the common folk wouldn't hesitate to rob and kill a passing traveler, even if that traveler only had a few pieces of dried food and a tattered garment.

In terms of hygiene, cities aren't necessarily better than the countryside—they might even be worse. Generally speaking, epidemics always spread in densely populated areas. Water and food that the locals can tolerate might wreak havoc on a modern person's digestive system. Besides bacterial infection, food and water also carry the risk of parasites.

Poor sanitation may make you ill, and even without sanitation issues you might still fall sick. If you're injured while executing your mission, you'll have no medical services beyond the small amount of medicine you carry and whatever local Chinese doctors are available. A dog bite or a wound from a rusty knife could cost you your life—even if you're rushed back to Lingao, the journey is so long that you might very well die on the way.

You may face attacks from fleas, bedbugs, ticks, and other parasites—these creatures exist in vast numbers in this time-space, and not only among the poor. These parasites won't just make you uncomfortable and covered in bumps; they also carry all sorts of strange diseases, some of which can't even be effectively treated in the modern era.

Finally, once captured on the mainland, the Foreign Intelligence Bureau cannot launch a rescue operation immediately. If you're unlucky and there's no radio station nearby—or no one to notify headquarters in time—it may take until the scheduled contact date before headquarters even knows you've been captured. By the time they send people to rescue you, several months may have already passed. Being captured isn't necessarily because your work went wrong or your identity was exposed. The Spanish might arrest you simply because you're Chinese. The Later Jin might arrest you simply because you're Han. As for the Ming Dynasty, perhaps merely because you're doing business and have some money, you might catch the eye of some Eastern Depot spy or county yamen runner looking to make a little extra cash. Even disguising yourself as a poor person doesn't make you safe—you might be arrested and tortured simply because a crime occurred locally and the authorities need an outside person without connections to use as a scapegoat.

Various levels of government, organs of dictatorship, or even private organizations of the Ming, Later Jin, or European colonizers will all torture you. Some want confessions; others simply want to squeeze money out of you. Prisons in this time-space don't just lack basic human rights—they may not even guarantee your right to survive. You might be killed by jailers using various methods. Moreover, this is an era with a fondness for homosexual relationships, so a fair-skinned modern person might very well fall victim to some lecherous old man...

"...Even if you're rescued, you may still suffer psychological and physiological disabilities and trauma from the torture you endured and, um... various other kinds of abuse..."

This deliberately horrifying depiction of the future stirred up a commotion—this made the 17th century sound less like the past and more like a living hell.

"If anyone feels they're not suited for this work, you can still submit a request to withdraw," Wang Ding said. "The Organization Division's transfer procedures haven't been processed yet. We'll return your application materials, and no records will be kept."

The room fell silent. Of course, no one present said they were afraid. First, it would be too embarrassing; second, there were the examples of Guangzhou and Leizhou stations right there. No one had heard of such terrifying conditions. At least all the people who had been sent out were still alive and well—and living quite comfortably.

"Hmph, that's just a disclaimer," Huang Hua commented, then said loudly: "Fine, I understand! From now on, if something happens, it's none of your business—it's all our own doing! Just let me sign a death pledge with the Bureau."

According to their agreement with the Colonial Trade Department, the transmigrators sent out belonged to both sides without distinction. As for training, it was all handled by the Foreign Intelligence Bureau. The specific courses offered would be decided after discussions among the various departments.

Li Yan had originally wanted Hu Qingbai to allocate classrooms and dormitories from Fangcaodi for intelligence personnel training. But Jiang Shan felt that location was too frequented, too bustling. Moreover, it was too "modern"—it lacked the immersive feel of Ming Dynasty life. Ultimately, only Intelligence Training Center Division A was established at Fangcaodi, specifically for training indigenous intelligence personnel, including field agents, administrative staff, and intelligence analysts.

Intelligence Training Center Division B, dedicated to training transmigrators as field operatives, was set up in the former residence of Gou the Second in Lingao County Town. This place had been sitting empty for a while. Not only was the building area large enough, but there was also sufficient open land around the rear courtyard for expanding with new structures. Moreover, Lingao County Town could still be considered a well-preserved specimen of Ming society.

Xiong Buyu, head of the County Liaison Office, went to find Magistrate's Secretary Sun Ruiwu, and immediately had this confiscated property cheaply "sold." It was actually an empty contract with paper money—the county officials got their kickbacks.

The Construction Company modified the location slightly, mainly adding living and training facilities. Thus the Intelligence Bureau Training Center was established. For secrecy's sake, there was no signboard, no gate guards—only two reliable indigenous workers assigned to watch the main gate. Personnel and materials all came and went at night.

The training program was designed by Jiang Shan. As for curriculum, it was primarily based on recommendations from the Political Security General Administration's Wu Mu, Leizhou Station's Chen Tianxiong, and Yu Eshui.

Since most people would be operating in the Ming Dynasty, the training courses mainly focused on making them "seem like Ming Dynasty people." By contrast, those willing to operate in European territories required less effort—they didn't need to pose as Ming Dynasty subjects.

How to seem like a Ming person was the sole focus. Historical materials alone weren't enough. Fortunately, they had long-term accumulations from both the Guangzhou and Leizhou stations. They had gathered genuine first-hand information on all aspects of life: daily details, customs and habits, social conditions, and more.

The first hurdle was appearance, which was easiest to address. From the moment everyone entered this training class, they stopped getting haircuts and began growing their hair—those who wished to use Buddhist monk as a cover identity could be exempted from growing hair. Depending on face shape and each person's desired cover identity, some people would also grow beards.

For immersion, besides wearing training uniforms during certain exercises, everyone dressed in Ming Dynasty clothing for daily activities and classes. The dormitories contained no modern items. Their dorm rooms were kept exactly as they should have looked in the Ming Dynasty: hard plank beds, sheets made of local coarse cloth, and the hard, rectangular pillows used by ancient people. Windows were covered with paper; at night, they used either candles or oil lamps.

Every day's meals were prepared by indigenous cooks in "authentic Ming Guangdong style" or "authentic Ming Fujian style"—these two cuisines tasted completely different from the Cantonese and Fujianese cuisine everyone was familiar with. They also ate "bitter food reminiscent of the past" two days a week: meals centered on sweet potatoes, black flour, and various other miscellaneous grains. These weren't the small packages of "miscellaneous grains" sold in supermarkets that cost more than rice, but genuine grains that peasants used to survive. The cornmeal buns were made with husks; one bite and they crumbled, but no matter how long you chewed, you couldn't swallow them. The sweet potato porridge had peels; drinking it, you saw only sweet potato and peel, barely any rice grains...

This dietary arrangement was meant to help the transmigrators adapt in advance to the food of this time-space, so that those who had already grown accustomed to refined rice and white flour wouldn't be unable to eat or get diarrhea the moment they stepped onto the mainland. Fortunately, since D-Day they'd all been eating brown rice for so long that they'd already somewhat adapted to actual coarse grains, so the digestive adjustment wasn't too severe.

Next came the matters of accent and identity. After discussion, everyone agreed it was best to pose as people from Guangdong. This was primarily because Cantonese dialect had relatively small differences across the ancient and modern periods, and many people in the transmigrator collective could already speak the Cantonese of this time-space. Additionally, with the Guangzhou Station in place, obtaining household registrations and establishing identities were quite easy. If necessary, they could even set up a cover "home" for field operatives.

Language learning focused mainly on the official language. Being able to speak Ming Dynasty mandarin would allow one to get by in many situations. Of course, communicating with local commoners was still somewhat difficult, but that could be gradually learned at the deployment location.

As for writing, everyone had to practice calligraphy with a brush. It didn't need to be beautiful—just usable enough for writing letters and keeping accounts. As for simplified characters, Yu Eshui didn't think they'd be much of a problem—such vulgar characters were also widely used in social life. As for classical Chinese, that was even less necessary. As long as you could speak Ming Dynasty mandarin, you could simply write in vernacular—most merchants' skills were only at this level anyway.

Once appearance and language passed muster, one could roughly blend into Ming Dynasty society. Of course, there was still much more to learn afterward. Particularly the living habits and appropriate demeanor befitting a Ming Dynasty person: things that would frighten or anger a modern person might not faze an indigenous person at all. What locals feared or dreaded, a modern person might be completely indifferent to.

"Never let your sympathy run wild, and don't rush to stand up for justice," Yu Eshui emphasized. "Don't assume ancient society had simple, honest folk customs. Many of the scams and tricks of modern society have been passed down since ancient times. At best, you'll lose money; at worst, you'll bring endless trouble upon yourself! As for publicly standing up for justice, that's absolutely forbidden. Don't think that just because you're from the 21st century you're some kind of superman. Even if you can protect yourself, once you've offended someone locally, you won't be able to establish yourself there, and all your efforts in that area will come to nothing."

Yu Eshui took a sip of water. "I advise everyone to forget all the tropes you've learned from martial arts novels. Rescuing beauties, drawing your sword to help, gambling heroics... none of this has anything to do with our work, and is in fact very harmful to it! Sometimes even fatal!

"Unless headquarters approves it, with a complete action plan and necessary external support, don't try to organize underground societies in the area—the Ming Dynasty also has underworld organizations, often with deep foundations that even the authorities are helpless against. Their methods are no less ruthless than those of later generations. It's no easier to become a godfather in a Ming Dynasty county town than it was in your home county in the old time-space.

...

Even regarding male-female relations, they were reminded to exercise strict caution.

"You'll be gone for years, and of course we can't expect everyone to remain celibate. Once you're settled in locally, headquarters will arrange for a reliable domestic secretary to accompany you. Don't patronize brothels casually—you'll catch all sorts of venereal diseases. Late Ming is a period when syphilis was introduced and erupting on a massive scale. Don't pursue married women either—Ming Dynasty law stipulates that if a cuckolded husband kills an adulterer and adulteress, it's not a crime. Headquarters went through all the trouble to train you and send you to the Ming Dynasty, not so you could be like Ximen Qing and get your head chopped off by Wu Song. Also, don't pursue virginal unmarried girls either..."

"Can't we even go to high-class brothels?" someone raised a question. "You mentioned in your last lecture that high-class brothels in the Ming Dynasty were a kind of social venue. If we're disguised as big merchants, we'll definitely have to go to such places. And gambling too—sometimes the work may require it."

"Of course, that's a different matter," Yu Eshui said. "However, high-class establishments are money pits, and the rules there are a whole other system. Those who don't understand will just waste money and be laughed at—I'm not very familiar with it either. Lin Baiguang has someone under him who's very well-versed in these matters. We'll have him come later to teach you all the ins and outs of eating, drinking, whoring, and gambling. So you won't be cheated."

"That would be great."

Someone continued asking about the woman issue: "Can we buy women locally?"

"Yes," Yu Eshui nodded. "Relatively speaking, bought women are the safest. But buying women requires going through proper procedures and channels..."

So-called proper procedures and channels meant buying as much as possible from the local human markets and slave dealers. Although prices were somewhat higher, you wouldn't encounter "pigeon release" scams.

"Or there are daughters from humble local families. If you've taken a fancy to someone's daughter, you can hire a matchmaker to negotiate. If the price is right, it can usually be arranged."

"What if a local family takes a fancy to me and wants to marry their daughter to me?" someone asked.

Yu Eshui spread his hands. "That involves policy issues. I can't answer that."

Li Yan, who had been sitting off to the side, laughed and said: "As long as you didn't bring a wife or girlfriend with you, headquarters doesn't object to you taking a wife or concubine locally. You just need to ensure their reliability. However, if you take a wife, the transmigrator collective will also guarantee her status as 'wife.' In other words, when you relocate or return to Lingao in the future, you cannot take another wife. Is everyone clear on this?"

"Clear!" The crowd responded excitedly.

"Remember, the deeper you penetrate the mainland, the harder it is for headquarters to support you," Li Yan emphasized in class. "In the two Guangs, we have Gao Ju as a protective umbrella, we have the Qiwei Escort Bureau, and we have our Special Reconnaissance Team. If necessary, the Navy can even go bombard Guangzhou. But where you're going, you'll have nothing. It might take headquarters months to receive news from you. Everything must rely on yourself. Although slips in daily life details aren't as fatal as they would be in modern intelligence operations, if they accumulate, they'll still attract attention."

Subsequently, people came to teach them various common etiquettes and appropriate behavior. They needed to know, according to their status, when they should bow with clasped hands, when they should kowtow, how to address others based on relationships... These courses were generally taught by the most reliable indigenous personnel, and Zhang Xingjiao was one of them. As a scholar, even though he lived in a small southern border county, he was well-versed in all kinds of etiquette.

The greatest assistance in this regard surprisingly came from Wang Ci. This County School Director was lured by Xiong Buyu under the pretense of "We have long admired the rituals of the Great Ming and hope to learn a thing or two." Wang Ci had been quite demoralized by the Australians' superiority in all respects, especially since he was now completely surviving on "handouts" to maintain the County School and the Jasmine Academy. This mixture of internal and external distress was much more acute than that of the county yamen's officials who lived in a drunken stupor.

Now, suddenly hearing that a group of Australians were "yearning for civilization"—and seeing that they had even changed their clothing and hairstyles to Ming Dynasty style—he was so moved he nearly shed tears. His spirits were instantly lifted, and he taught etiquette and proper conduct with tremendous enthusiasm. He even firmly refused any compensation, doing several years' work for the training class without pay.

Next, they brought in clerks and yamen runners from the study class who were diligently "studying" and painstakingly "reforming their thoughts" to lecture on how the Ming Dynasty's local government operated, how to handle affairs, various customary practices and abuses, and how various identities—merchants, landlords, itinerant monks and Daoists—should interact with the diverse people in the county yamen. They learned what activities required what relationships in the county to be established, how to offer bribes and divide the spoils; and what to do if something went wrong to either escape punishment or flee...
