# Chapter 697 - Heading to Hong Kong

Shi Zhiqi's spirits lifted instantly. He watched the Small Daihatsu liaison boat reach the accommodation ladder on the other side of *Transport-11* and immediately ordered the signals officer:

"Signal *Special-11*; I want to board the flagship to report on combat preparations!"

The Pearl River Estuary Detachment's departure lacked a grand ceremony, only loudspeakers playing "Warship March" as a farewell tune. Though the Navy desperately wanted a naval band, they couldn't scrape together enough musicians from the five hundred transmigrators. Native musicians had to learn from video tutorials, which naturally presented many difficulties.

The formation was led by the four patrol boats of the 4th Patrol Boat Squadron, followed by one squadron after another setting sail. Every ship was fully flagged. Chen Haiyang's Chief of Naval Operations flag and Wen Desi's Naval Advisor flag fluttered from the main and mizzen masts of *Special-11*. Shi Zhiqi sat on his flagship *Big Whale*, watching his Marine Detachment Commander flag flutter with some pride.

On the shore, many spectators gathered. A large formation setting sail was a rare spectacular show for them. Ships draped in flags, mighty sailors manning the rails, and cannons polished to a shine... Wen Desi spared no effort promoting the concept of "Navy SHOW." Only by making the public think the military was majestic and beautiful could they attract people to enlist, rather than the current semi-coercive conscription.

The policy of "soldiers first, re-education later" was good, but Wen Desi hoped to form social values in the future empire where military service was an honor. He strongly supported anything that enhanced soldiers' honor and social image.

Just now, Shi Zhiqi had submitted his painstakingly compiled—or rather "plagiarized"—*Marine Corps Uniforms, Insignia, Ranks, and Protocol Plan*. Superficially, this was a proposal to "enhance the military's image," but actually it was the beginning of Shi Zhiqi's "de-navalization of the Marine Corps." Wen Desi didn't think that deeply and greatly appreciated the system he had worked so hard to create. This put Shi Zhiqi in an even better mood.

The Pearl River Estuary Detachment arrived in Macao waters on September 4th. Such a massive fleet suddenly appearing in Macao waters caused panic among the Portuguese. After brief confusion, all large Portuguese ships in the harbor hoisted sails and prepared for battle.

The transmigrators observed Macao's forts and harbor through telescopes. Taking Macao wouldn't be difficult, but the place was too small, often having difficulties with even basic vegetable and freshwater supplies, and lacked development prospects. Hong Kong Island was much better.

"Leave this place to the Portuguese." Wen Desi lay on a rattan chair on *Special-11*'s poop deck, feeling slightly seasick—this ship was still too small and rocked heavily in rough seas. Shi Zhiqi had invited him to the *Big Whale*, but he had declined.

"At least wait until they finish building the Ruins of St. Paul's," Chen Haiyang joked, lowering his binoculars. From a naval officer's perspective, Hong Kong was a rare excellent naval base, while Macao's harbor was much inferior.

The fleet left Macao waters and continued sailing west. Actually, they had already entered the Pearl River Estuary waters—the Lingdingyang made famous by Wen Tianxiang's poem. Neilingding Island was ahead to the fleet's left.

This was part of the so-called "Inner Ocean." Here the coastline was tortuous and winding, indented and staggered, with hidden coves everywhere visible for ambush. Occasionally one would encounter broad river mouths where fresh and salt water mixed.

The "Inner Ocean" was dotted with scattered islands. Some were inhabited; others were good places for fishermen to anchor and rest. But most were barren, uninhabited islets.

These barren islands also provided excellent places for pirates to rest and ambush. The entire special detachment maintained vigilance while sailing, guarding against sudden pirate attacks—not only were Liu Xiang's ships active here, but also many scattered small bands. Even fishermen might try to "grab a handful" at any time.

This area was a prime hunting ground for pirates: maritime traffic was highly developed here, with harbors everywhere providing merchants maximum convenience. Bulk cargoes were loaded onto ships shuttling between coastal towns and villages. Although these goods weren't as valuable as "foreign ship" cargoes, robbing a boatload of daily necessities was still valuable to pirates—they sold faster. After collecting and organizing massive amounts of pirate intelligence from the External Intelligence Bureau, Xu Ke told Chen Haiyang that pirates here took everything. Not to mention low-value daily goods like fishing rods, rice, and salt—they wouldn't even let go of "cold goods" like bricks and tiles.

"I can only say pirates are too poor..." Xu Ke sighed.

Chen Haiyang said: "A rising tide floats all boats. Initially, bribing involved a few bottles of wine and cartons of cigarettes. Later, even a fifty-thousand red envelope was just a token gesture."

"North Lantau is ahead."

"Order the lead ship to change heading to 120. All ships follow in order! No straggling!" Chen Haiyang issued the order to turn. "We're crossing the Brothers waters."

Chen Haiyang planned to command the fleet past Lantau Island, through the Brothers, then past Ma Wan Channel, entering Victoria Harbour from the western approach. Of course, this place wouldn't be called Victoria Harbour in the future. But the proposal to call it Empress Wu Zetian Bay met with considerable opposition.

For European ships departing Macao and entering the Pearl River Estuary waters, the Brothers was their first important landmark on the chart. One could say sailing past the Brothers was the first step toward Guangzhou.

When the fleet entered the Brothers waters, Chen Haiyang ordered the entire fleet to alert status—north of this area was the famous Tuen Mun. The Portuguese had originally attempted to occupy this place as their China trade base but were defeated by the Ming army. According to intelligence provided by Xu Ke from the External Intelligence Bureau, several hundred Ming troops were garrisoned here, possibly with a small number of war junks responsible for monitoring and patrolling the sea. The appearance of the Australian-Song Navy could very likely trigger armed conflict.

 However, the fleet passed through these waters without any combat. Chen Haiyang and others observed along the way but saw almost no signs of naval vessels—according to historical data provided by Yu Eishui, the Guangdong Navy should have been conducting regular patrols with war junks in this area of the Pearl River Estuary.

Yellow Claws commented: "The system is one thing; whether it can be executed is another. This is the late Ming era. It's probably just empty words on paper."

Yellow Claws had boarded as a member of the long-range survey team—Hong Kong Island in this timeline also needed comprehensive surveying and mapping. Actually he could have let others come, but Yellow Claws strongly hoped to become a ship captain in the future, so he volunteered for this voyage to accumulate nautical knowledge and ship-handling skills.

Chen Haiyang said: "It's probably because the navy has too few ships to cover everything."

"I really hope we encounter the Ming navy and have a real fight! Even if I just get to fire a few shots!" Yellow Claws was excited, gazing into the distance. Aside from scattered fishing boats, there was nothing on the sea. This area had many large and small islands and sandbars, which in another timeline belonged administratively to Hong Kong's Outlying Islands District.

Yellow Claws' hope for a fight was soon realized. That afternoon, as they passed Ma Wan Channel, the communications officer suddenly shouted:

"Vanguard spotted suspicious vessels!"

Ma Wan Channel was a north-south waterway, with Ma Wan Island to the west and Tsing Yi Island to the east. Below Ma Wan Island lay a small islet called Tang Lung Chau. In the sheltered waters between the two islands, many fishing boats of various sizes were anchored. The lookout on the vanguard patrol boat alertly discovered that bonfires had been lit on the hills of both Tsing Yi and Ma Wan islands. Clearly signaling something.

Subsequently, several suspicious-looking fishing boats appeared on the sea, gradually approaching the vanguard squadron, seeming to spy on the fleet. Upon discovering the fleet's massive size, they quickly departed.

Chen Haiyang said: "Those are pirate ships." He raised his binoculars. "Order the patrol boat squadron to capture the enemy vessels!"

As the signalman sent the signal, minutes later, four patrol boats from the lead patrol boat squadron broke formation and pounced toward the fleeing fishing boats.

Yellow Claws raised his binoculars, watching the distant scene. Clearly the enemy were few; only three small black-awning boats were fleeing near Ma Wan Island. But their clumsy hulls couldn't match the speed of the agile lateen-rigged patrol boats.

The patrol boats quickly bracketed the three black-awning boats. Just then, Yellow Claws saw white smoke rise from the first black-awning boat and heard faint cannon fire.

"They're firing, they're firing!" The lookout sailor shouted. "Enemy ship opening fire!"

Almost simultaneously, thick smoke erupted from the two patrol boats already blocking the pirate ships' path, flashes of fire flickering within the smoke.

Many small white water columns instantly rose on the sea surface around the ships. The hull seemed to shudder, and the sail on the black-awning boat fell.

"Enemy ship on fire!" Just as the lookout shouted, a small explosion occurred on one black-awning boat, igniting a large fire.

"Didn't see cannon fire, how did it explode?"

"The gunpowder on the pirate ship exploded." Chen Haiyang said nonchalantly. "Pirates leave their gunpowder kegs open on deck during battle."

The battle ended quickly. Two black-awning boats were captured. The other, due to the intense fire, was deemed not worth saving.

According to pirate capture procedures, captured prisoners were not processed at sea. Instead, men were sent to dismantle the few cannons and confiscate the gunpowder. Then sailors were ordered to pilot the black-awning boats and follow the fleet, forbidden from leaving formation.
