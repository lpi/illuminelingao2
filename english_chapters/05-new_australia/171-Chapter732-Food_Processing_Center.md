# Chapter 732 - Food Processing Center

The *Great Whale* returned to Hong Kong, where it underwent temporary modification. A steam-powered gantry crane was installed on deck, along with hoisting winches and dredging buckets. To ensure stability during operations, anchors removed from several other ships were retrofitted, giving it a total of eight anchors.

When this modified vessel wobbled its way to Humen, everyone couldn't help but laugh at its strange and ugly appearance. Of course, there was also great concern for its safety.

"The crane is so tall—isn't the center of gravity unstable?" Huang Zhuazi had arrived at Humen aboard the *Great Whale*. He hadn't felt much pitching along the way, but every time waves slapped the hull, the creaking of the steel gantry crane made him worry—what if it capsized?

A bespectacled otaku-looking man spoke confidently: "No problem. According to my calculations, referencing wave-making resistance, roll coefficients, and a series of other factors, the probability of capsizing is less than 12%."

"Still sounds scary."

"Wind and waves in the Pearl River are much smaller than at sea, so the probability will drop further."

"I hope so." Chen Haiyang looked at this odd monstrosity and felt uneasy, but now was a matter of resolving "have versus have-not," so there was no room to nitpick about safety.

Le Lin looked miserable—as captain of the *Great Whale*, sailing this ship to Humen had been painstaking. With so many long, thick objects installed, the propulsion system remained the original diesel engine. Power hadn't increased, but the center of gravity had shifted, making movement heavy and clumsy. He personally took the helm all the way, struggling to reach Humen at a speed of 3 knots.

"This ship is too hard to drive..." Le Lin complained. "I should be building my official residence on Victoria Peak..."

"Stop complaining. Check the ship's condition immediately and prepare for departure."

By the pier at Humen's Yaniangxie Island, voices boiled over. Work shanties, military songs, the roar of steam engines, and the crying of prisoners mixed together.

Captives transported here from various places numbered over four thousand. Part were deemed hostile or threatening to future rule; the other part were impoverished locals being taken in. They would be transported to Hainan to bolster the local population.

The Pearl River Delta was already overpopulated in the late Ming, with large numbers flooding into mountain areas for agricultural development. Removing some population wouldn't damage local production or economy but would reduce pressure on the local ecosystem. The removal of large numbers of gentry and magnates also opened up greater business space for local small landlords, rich peasants, and small merchants.

Captives—men and women, old and young—were shipped boat by boat to Humen, where they were temporarily housed, waiting for ships to transport them to Hong Kong along with "confiscated" spoils collected from everywhere.

Spoils brought back by various squadrons over the past month piled up like mountains at Humen. The transmigrators remained tasteless, taking everything; even tables, chairs, and benches from "purged" wealthy households weren't spared. To eliminate unstable factors caused by large population gatherings, people were transported to Hong Kong first. Weather and sea conditions permitting, several special service ships full of people sailed for Hong Kong daily, where they would undergo purification and quarantine.

Returning squadrons also conducted short-term rest and sanitation work at Humen. Zhang Tumu administered deworming medication to all officers and men, and conducted successive flea exterminations—parasites were very active in rural areas. Anyone with health issues was transferred to Hong Kong for treatment.

Fifteen-year-old Fu Ji carried a small blue cloth bundle on his shoulder—given by his mother when he left home to join the army. Inside were a few ragged clothes and a pair of new shoes he couldn't bear to wear. barefoot, he waited patiently for the group ahead to board.

His group consisted entirely of volunteers defecting to the Australians, so order was good, with no guards needed. The Australian transport officers gave each person a water gourd and a black leather bowl—for eating and drinking on the road.

He hoped only to eat his fill upon reaching Lingao—that was his sole purpose.

Fu Ji was an ordinary country boy. Originally nameless, just called Fu Ya-er (Fu the Second), he was given a name by his master only after becoming an apprentice.

He started apprenticeship at twelve, following the custom of three years learning, three years helping. But just as he started "helping"—learning real skills and earning a little money—his master suddenly died.

Fu Ji and his whole family instantly fell into dire straits. Having learned a trade since childhood, he'd neglected farm work. With many people and little land at home—older brother and sister, plus three younger siblings—they barely survived on two *mu* of thin land plus some tenant farming. For a large family, suddenly having another mouth to feed was a disaster.

One day, Fu Ji squatted on a field ridge, stomach growling with hunger—the thin sweet potato porridge from morning had long vanished, and the next meal wouldn't come until dusk.

It couldn't compare to when he was with Master. Though Master rarely let him eat his fill, whenever they catered weddings or funerals in town or at big houses, he could always stuff himself on leftovers. Intermittent feasting amidst long-term semi-hunger was better than this seemingly eternal starvation.

Not far away, cooking smoke rose from the Humen stockade—smoke from the "Short-haired Thieves" or "Australian" army cooking lunch after driving away the government troops. They ate three meals a day, just like landlords. This alone made Fu Ji envious to death.

When the Australians came to Humen, they fought a big battle with government troops, beating them badly and occupying Humen. Local villagers initially fled for a few days but returned when they saw no harassment. The Australians committed no crimes nearby—no looting, arson, or snatching women. They only sent people to demand payment of some "burden." The burden wasn't too heavy, and with Australians personally overseeing things to ensure big households paid the bulk and small households the remainder, no trouble arose. He only heard that a large village nearby, relying on its numbers and single clan lineage, built a stockade to resist forcefully—and was wiped out in a day. Many were killed or captured. The leading large clan had their entire male population and property taken, even their ancestral hall dismantled. This made the wealthy families in the area panic-stricken.

But for Fu Ji's family, the Australians had little impact. Fu Ji still went hungry. One day he followed a neighbor to Humen stockade to sell vegetables and poultry. Since the Australians stationed at Humen, nearby villagers constantly rowed small boats to sell vegetables, fresh poultry, and eggs—according to *Provisions Management Regulations*, the Fubo Army purchased only poultry, eggs, and aquatic products for meat when conditions permitted. Chinese were born merchants; they didn't ask why the Fubo Army wanted only vegetables and eggs, but quickly adjusted their goods to meet customer demand.

Fu Ji had seen the Fubo Army's appearance and equipment when the Australians came down to the countryside to assess "Reasonable Burden." This time, he witnessed their quality of life. Soldiers ate large bowls of rice, unlimited, as much as they wanted. For side dishes there was fish, and large cauldrons of vegetable soup with eggs... Fu Ji swallowed hard watching—this life was better than the village landlords'! Just the pure rice was something landlords would mix with sweet potato slices.

He couldn't help asking the neighbor: "Uncle, are they eating a reward feast today?"

"What reward feast? Australians eat like this every day. And three meals a day!" The neighbor said enviously. "If I didn't have a family and three 'money-eating dragons' to raise, I'd go with the Fubo Army too! Even dying in battle would be worth it!"

These words moved Fu Ji. Rather than starving at home or wandering aimlessly for work, better to just join the Australians. At least he could live comfortably for a few years. He thought for a few days, visited Humen secretly twice more to watch the soldiers' daily life, and felt he could do it. He told his family he wanted to join the Australian army.

Though his parents knew joining the army meant he might never return, perhaps dying somewhere, the family's desperate situation left them no choice but to agree.

Arriving at Humen stockade, he saw many aspiring recruits. Not just young men, but half-grown kids like him, and even old men, women, and children—the Fubo Army's food supply was so good that many nearby poor folks came to "join the gang." Chen Haiyang ordered that no one be refused—old or young, man or woman, all welcome. Not only welcoming individuals, but preferably whole families. So many families arrived dragging children and elders, tortured by poverty and hunger into losing their timidity, willing to go anywhere that promised a full belly.

Fu Ji stripped naked in a shed for inspection, had his teeth checked, answered simple questions like age and name, then pressed his handprint on a paper as required. He didn't know or care what the paper said.

Leaving the shed, his head was shaved, he showered, and received a set of clean used uniforms. He was now a "new immigrant." He heard from managers that newcomers had to be sent to Lingao for a few months of training before officially "joining the gang."

New immigrants lived in separate barracks waiting for ships. Their food was worse than regular soldiers', but the thick rice porridge with fish and vegetables still made him want to cry with happiness—though only one bowl per meal, at least he ate three times a day.

Thinking of reaching Lingao, becoming an official soldier for the Australians, and eating open-bellied feasts, Fu Ji felt incredibly excited about the prospect.

"Fu Ji!" Just as he waited patiently to board the transport ship to "Full-Belly Happiness," an Australian clerk-looking person suddenly appeared.

"Here!" Following camp rules, he raised his hand. "I'm here!"

"You are Fu Ji?"

"Yes—" He grew uneasy.

"You're a cook?"

"This lowly one served a three-year apprenticeship..."

"Come out. Don't leave for now. The food center is short-handed; go work there directly," the clerk said in a tone allowing no refusal. "Follow me!"

Fu Ji bewilderingly followed the clerk to a small shed, realizing he was to be a "cooking soldier." This wasn't hard; three years of apprenticeship meant he had basic cooking skills.

"No need for you to cook." A higher-ranking clerk sitting behind a desk inside said, "Can you slaughter and butcher chickens and ducks?"

"This lowly one mostly did that during apprenticeship," Fu Ji said. "Even helped slaughter pigs..."

"Perfect." The clerk picked up a card, filled something out, and handed it to a lower clerk. "Take him for purification! Process according to food and medical standards!"

Fu Ji was taken to shave his head again, bathe, and have his nails cut. His whole body was inspected thoroughly for wounds or skin diseases. Finally, after everything was normal, he had to drink several bitter medicinal liquids. He was taken to a separate stockade by the river. In a room by the gate, an Australian met him. This man was different from the others—tall, fat, wearing black-framed glasses made of tortoiseshell with two glass lenses, and a rectangular bar with colorful cloth strips sewn on his left chest.

"From today on, you are a member of the Field Kitchen Processing Center." Thunder (Lei En) looked him over, checking his hands and nails. "Pay constant attention to personal hygiene!" He jutted his chin. "Read it to him!" A young girl in uniform beside him immediately read aloud the sanitary regulations: mandatory bath before and after work, use soap for hands, no long hair or nails allowed...

"Remember all that?"

"This lowly one... understands..." After hearing all this, Fu Ji was dizzy. unable to digest it all, he just said he remembered.

"Good, take him in. Educate him frequently later." Thunder frowned. "Hygiene habits aren't formed in a day or two!"

Fu Ji was bewilderingly led into this heavily guarded camp. Entering, his eyes went wide. When had such large-scale buildings appeared here?

To support long-term combat needs, the Task Force had established a large-scale field kitchen logistics processing center at Humen, equipped with a mobile gas-powered cold storage unit.

Rows of prefab houses and bamboo sheds stood on the high ground by the river. A steam pump smoked black and roared, pumping endless river water. The water underwent primary purification and disinfection in filter pools here before supplying the troops. A strange large ship moored at the bank, carrying a massive rectangular wooden box like a house, topped with a huge reed shade. It looked ugly and odd.

This was a refrigerated ship. The wooden box was actually a modified 40-foot container serving as a mobile gas cold storage unit. For insulation, a wooden structural thermal layer was added outside the box, filled with multiple layers of diatomaceous earth and kapok. Refrigeration gas came from a gasifier installed on the ship—or supplied from shore. This refrigerated ship could store 22 tons of frozen goods. The only drawback was lacking propulsion; it had to be towed by a large launch.

The clerk first took him into a large bamboo shed: "You work in the butchering workshop. This is where you shower and change. You must shower and change here every day before entering the workshop. Understood?"

"This lowly one knows." Fu Ji thought the rules here were huge—bathing and changing just to kill chickens.

"No wandering around allowed. Stay in your assigned workshop. No running about." He pointed to a nearby steaming bamboo shed emitting vapor. "That's the scalding workshop, full of boiling water. Don't go in unless necessary—careful you don't get scalded to death!"

Fu Ji thus began work at the processing center. His job was butchering raw carcasses. Acquired chickens, ducks, and geese were slaughtered in the slaughter workshop, scalded for defeathering, then sent to his workshop.

The "workshop" was a temporary structure combining modern architecture with traditional shed-building techniques using bamboo, reed mats, and rope. It was tall and airy. Rows of windows near the top lacked glass but had insect screens. In rain, rolled-up mats could be lowered by ropes to keep rain out—very ingenious. Butchers worked in such workshops.

A strange smell always permeated the workshop—he didn't know it was disinfectant. Dozens of workers holding butchering knives disassembled processed poultry on tables.

He had never done such strange work: Master and other cooks mostly used whole chickens and ducks. sometimes taking breast meat or legs for dishes, but disassembling a chicken into pieces like this was a first for him.

The cleanliness habits were so strict Fu Ji felt it was nitpicking. Hand-washing after using the toilet was monitored—soap was mandatory. Nails checked every seven days; cut immediately if long. As for hair and beards, absolutely forbidden—everyone's head here was as smooth as an egg.

Clothes were changed daily—he didn't know who washed them, but clean clothes were always available, even the aprons were spotless.
