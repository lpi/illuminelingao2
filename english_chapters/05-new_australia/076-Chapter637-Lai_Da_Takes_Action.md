# Chapter 637 - Lai Da Takes Action

Gou Chengxuan was cautious and didn't dare interject. Only after their discussion on Huaxia and Barbarians ended did he continue: "It is reported that Wen Desi's official title is 'Chairman', as for Ma Qianzhu, it is 'Secretary of State'. The two titles are called 'Executive Committee Members'."

He didn't get the names and titles of these two people wrong, because they were written on bulletin boards and documents.

"Or so it is said, this gang of Hair Thieves are descendants of high officials and dignitaries in the Aus-Song country. Due to political changes in their country, they couldn't establish themselves in Australia, so they led their troops and escaped by ship. They had long admired the wealth of China, thus coming across ten thousand miles."

"Since they are descendants of the Song people, why didn't they submit a memorial to become vassals in the beginning?" A staff officer said, "The Court would surely have treated them favorably."

"The Hair Thieves learned strange skills and clever tricks overseas, thinking they could dominate a corner relying on iron ships and firearms. Isn't this bullying my Great Ming for having no capable men? Only by severely suppressing and exterminating the ugly kind can we cut off these overseas barbarians' hearts of coveting China!" The speaker was very young, only twenty-seven or twenty-eight. He was not He Rubin's staff officer, but Qian Taichong, a staff officer of Zhao Ruyi, the Left Administration Vice Commissioner and Sub-prefectural Magistrate of Hainan, specially sent to Guangzhou to be responsible for liaison between the two sides.

Qian Taichong passed the Xiucai exam at seventeen and was an upright salaried scholar. He had quite a literary reputation in his hometown and was appreciated by a group of local gentry. However, since then, he failed the provincial exam four times in a row. Feeling ashamed to face people in his hometown, he simply came out to be a traveling advisor.

This person had quite some learning and talent, and usually thought highly of himself. Although he was recommended to Shi Bangyao's staff by fellow townsmen and teachers, his relationship with other staff members was not harmonious. Zhao Ruyi simply sent him to Guangzhou to be responsible for liaison in He Rubin's army.

His impassioned statement forced everyone to express their agreement, saying indeed it should be so, etc.

Next, the staff and generals asked some more questions. He Rubin then instructed the personal guards to take him down and guard him in his own old camp.

"Take him down, give him wine and food. Treat him well."

Gou Chengxuan finally relaxed his heart hanging in mid-air. The taste of seeing officials and being interrogated was indeed uncomfortable. He quickly kowtowed several times more, then cautiously retreated with the personal guards.

He was arranged in a special tent where Lai Da was also waiting. A while later, a personal guard came over and brought him several sets of clothes for changing, especially scholar's clothes like the square scarf and scholar's robe. This made Gou Chengxuan, who sometimes disguised as a beggar and sometimes dressed as a farmer, feel it was a good omen: The Commander-in-Chief seemed very satisfied with his answers, otherwise he would never treat him so kindly.

Lai Da also got several sets of new clothes. Master and servant bathed and changed clothes, feeling refreshed for a moment. Then soldiers brought food, and the two ate their fill. Gou Chengxuan lay on the straw bunk, thinking about how he would take revenge and extort after returning to Lingao with the government army. He thought and calculated again and again, and unknowingly fell into a deep sleep.

The next day, Chang Qingyun came to see him and chat. Because he was a stripped Xiucai, considered half a member of the scholar-official class, Chang Qingyun was very polite, not asking him to kneel to answer, talking relatively casually.

After some polite exchanges, Chang Qingyun inquired about and clarified details he didn't have time to ask carefully yesterday. Gou Chengxuan told everything he knew without reserve, explaining clearly one by one. He also copied out a list of major gentry and big households in the county, noting how much family property each had and whether they kept village braves.

Chang Qingyun was overjoyed to get this list: with this list, he could follow the map when arriving in Lingao, knowing roughly how much army provisions to demand from each big household and how much "respect" each household should give. Seeing Gou Chengxuan answered fluently and appropriately in the big tent yesterday, he knew this person was not simple and felt like winning him over. So he smiled and said to Gou Chengxuan: "May I ask for Brother Gou's courtesy name?"

"I dare not," Gou Chengxuan saw his happy face and asking for his courtesy name, knowing he was on the right track. With the recommendation and protection of the Commander's trusted staff officer, he would not only be exonerated but also guaranteed future fame and fortune if he curried favor well. "This lowly person's courtesy name is Zhongwei."

"Your Excellency the Commander values you very much, saying you are worthy of being a loyal and righteous scholar of the Great Ming." Because Chang Qingyun still needed Gou Chengxuan to risk his life for the next step, he fabricated a few sentences first. "The Commander intends to recommend you for a degree—"

Saying this, he deliberately paused to see Gou Chengxuan's reaction. Seeing his eyes shining, knowing he had taken the bait, he continued, "Only you are still a wanted criminal, and stripped of the Xiucai degree..."

"Little brother was framed by the Hair Thieves," Gou Chengxuan sighed. He knew if he had silver now, offering fifty or a hundred taels immediately to ask this staff officer to mediate, he could definitely remove this "wanted criminal" hat. But he was penniless now, unable to bring out money at all. "To be honest with brother, little brother has quite some land and property in Lingao. As long as the Hair Thieves are driven away and little brother recovers the family property, I will surely reward heavily..."

"Ah, Brother Zhongwei is treating me like a stranger by saying this." Chang Qingyun laughed. "As long as Your Excellency the Commander succeeds in this battle, your crime can be washed clean, and you can even get a merit citation."

Gou Chengxuan lacked officialdom experience after all; deeply hookwinked by a few sentences. "Yes, yes, little brother will definitely serve like a dog or horse!"

Chang Qingyun then stated his purpose: He Rubin wanted him to return to Lingao to gather military intelligence and mobilize village braves to support the government army.

"Brother Zhongwei is a Lingao native. Returning to Lingao with the Governor-General's proclamation to mobilize gentry and village braves is precisely a great opportunity for meeting wind and clouds, establishing merit and career!"

Gou Chengxuan was greatly alarmed. Just out of the dragon's pool, he had to go back to the tiger's den. This was sending him to his death! In Lingao, he was a person hated by everyone and despised by dogs; even his own wife and father-in-law didn't like him. If not for disfiguring his face and disguising back then, he would have been caught and hanged by the Hair Thieves long ago.

Now Commander He actually wanted him to sneak back into Lingao. He knew the Australians' formidability deeply; their internal control and external defense were a hundred times better than the Court's. Local gentry and big households, no matter how dissatisfied with Hair Thieves, dared not openly oppose them. Moreover, everyone always feared Hair Thieves had the sorcery of Thousand Li Voice Transmission; even private secret talks might be detected.

If he made any move back in Lingao, there was only a dead end.

He replied tremblingly: "Lowly person thanks Your Excellency the Commander for the grace, only these Hair Thieves are different from other thieves..."

Chang Qingyun's face changed: "Brother Zhongwei, this is the army. Do you know military law is ruthless!"

"Yes, yes," Gou Chengxuan was scared into weak legs. Not to mention being a wanted criminal, even an innocent good citizen given a "Hair Thief Spy" crime could be beheaded instantly upon an order. "Please beg for mercy for little brother," he immediately knelt on the ground begging bitterly. "Hair Thieves hate little brother to the bone. Once captured, I will be immediately executed by lingering death..." He knew empty begging like this was useless, so he hurriedly added that he knew the details of several big merchants supported by Hair Thieves in Lingao, and he would tell these details only to Chang Qingyun, "to count as brother's merit."

Seeing he couldn't squeeze any profit out, Chang Qingyun secretly cursed: "Country bumpkin! Pauper!"

The chance for extortion was gone. But he couldn't really push Gou Chengxuan too hard. After all, He Rubin didn't explicitly request sending Gou Chengxuan to Lingao. If this person really went back to Lingao and got caught and killed, the government army entering Lingao would lose an important informational source. Although Sun Tianbiao of the Lingao Wei-Suo was rushing from Zhaoqing day and night, he was a military household member after all, with limited understanding of civil sentiments, far less useful than a local snake like Gou Chengxuan.

Furthermore, Gou Chengxuan didn't look like a good person at first glance. having no family dependents or property here to restrain him, pushing him too hard might make him run away, or go directly to the Hair Thieves to betray government army information.

The so-called proposal of sending Gou Chengxuan to Lingao to mobilize village braves to support the government army was originally something He Rubin was indifferent about, with no established decision. Chang Qingyun was just using false words to intimidate him, hoping to squeeze some profit.

Seeing there was indeed no profit to be had, Chang Qingyun had to retreat a step, preparing to use pleading for him before He Rubin as a favor.

He pondered for a moment and said: "This matter seems to have room for maneuvering, only Your Excellency the Commander's strict order..." He deliberately showed a difficult expression so Gou Chengxuan would owe him a favor.

Gou Chengxuan hurriedly said: "Brother Qingyun, little brother has a follower named Lai Da. This person is quick-witted and also a Lingao native; he can undertake this mission."

Chang Qingyun saw he was willing to send a substitute, so he happily pushed the boat with the current, but said some difficult words again, making Gou Chengxuan beg bitterly for half a day before agreeing.

Having finally sent Chang Qingyun away, Gou Chengxuan quickly wiped the sweat from his forehead. He had experienced the formidability of these officials—compared to the magistrate who pretended to be deaf and dumb, they were all tigers that ate people without spitting bones. Gou Chengxuan felt the officialdom's terribleness even more.

He called Lai Da over immediately and told him everything just now. Gou Chengxuan sighed: "I have no choice either; I can only wrong you temporarily to go out and hide for a while."

Whether it was himself or Lai Da, even holding an Imperial Decree to Lingao might not mobilize village braves to support the government army. Big households wouldn't act until they saw Hair Thieves defeated and fleeing for real. So his plan was to let Lai Da cross the sea to Qiongshan first, then hide, wait for the grand army to advance towards Lingao, and follow behind.

Once the situation became clear, village braves would probably move out. By then, Lai Da mixing among them could justify himself.

Unexpectedly, Lai Da didn't agree with his plan:

"Master, this can never deceive the lords." Lai Da said, "Small one is willing to go to Lingao!"

"You go to Lingao?" Gou Chengxuan was surprised. "Isn't that throwing your life away for nothing? Those big households originally had rifts with the Gou family, and now awe at the Hair Thieves' might; they absolutely dare not support the government army." The only people at his disposal now were the Lai brothers. If any big household hoping to curry favor with Hair Thieves caught him and sent him to the Hair Thieves, Lai Da would either lose his life or have to dig stones.

"Not necessarily." Lai Da said, "Except for a few families following Hair Thieves dead-set, most big households are fence-sitters. Why wouldn't they fear the government army coming for suppression?"

As long as they were afraid, it was manageable. Returning to Lingao and taking out the Governor-General and Commander-in-Chief's official documents, big households dared not respond immediately, but they absolutely dared not harm him either.

"...Hair Thieves have been in Lingao for three years; big households always have dealings with Hair Thieves. After the government army recovers Lingao, the Court will appoint rehabilitation officials. The first step will be investigating Han traitors. If they have government documents in hand, they will not only be free from the crime of aiding rebels but also have the merit of maintaining the locality..."

Gou Chengxuan understood his meaning: This matter indeed had risks, but the returns were huge. He couldn't help looking at this wretched-looking servant with new eyes.

"Unexpected to see at your young age, your chest holds such hills and valleys (strategy/ambition)!"

"Small one was also forced!" Lai Da's eyes spit fire, "Since the stockade fell, we two brothers escaped with our lives by luck, thinking about revenge day and night..."

Gou Chengxuan knew Lai Da hated Hair Thieves so much. besides losing his past identity as a powerful slave and being unable to act tyrannically but instead being trampled by others, another important reason was that the woman he wanted, Chuqing, was abducted by Hair Thieves—Chuqing was a maid of Gou the Second's family, originally promised to Lai Da. After the Gou family's destruction, he heard she fell into the hands of a Hair Thief surnamed Wu who managed a farm. This person had three wives and four concubines, yet occupied Chuqing. Lai Da saw Chuqing on the road several times, eyes almost spitting fire, but dared not step forward to say a word, even deliberately avoiding her. Such hatred of seizing a wife was incomparably bitter.

Lai Da continued: "...As long as small one isn't caught by Hair Thieves, there is absolutely no risk with the big households. I can also gather some military intelligence by the way."

"Good! This matter is entrusted to you!" Gou Chengxuan pretended to be generous. "All gifts from big households, I want none; all rewarded to you!"

"Thank Master for the heavy reward!" Lai Da immediately knelt and kowtowed. "After government troops recover Lingao, with Master's ability and being a local native, how can the government rehabilitation lack Master? Small one goes first to pave the way for Master. By then, those big households will have to be round or square at your will!"

"Who is the first family you'll go to?"

"Huang Family Stockade."

Gou Chengxuan was unwilling. He originally prepared to accuse the Huang family of "attaching to thieves" to ruin their family completely.

"Master!" Lai Da knew his thoughts. "We can't topple the Huang family! Just the fact that his third son was killed by Hair Thieves puts him in an unbeatable position! Huang Family Stockade has strong soldiers and horses and a blood feud with Hair Thieves; it's not hard to ask them to mobilize village braves for support."

Gou Chengxuan thought about it and agreed, so he deflated. He could only curse Old Dog Huang and Villain Huang resentfully. Then sighed: "I only hate that Father's whereabouts are unknown, otherwise his and Uncle Hu's troops could also help."

"Since Hair Thieves didn't catch Master Hu, the Master is naturally safe." Lai Da comforted him. "Small one will search secretly after returning!"

After the discussion was settled, Chang Qingyun went to deal with the Commander again. He Rubin was originally uninterested in this matter, but seeing someone willing to take the risk without costing him a single soldier, he immediately issued the necessary documents and rewarded ten taels of silver. Lai Da folded the issued official documents into strips, wrapped them in oil paper, sewed them tightly in cloth, and then sewed them into his belt. Someone arranged for him to take a troop carrier ferry to Qiongshan.

In the operations room of the Maniao Headquarters, staff officers were conducting battlefield operations around a huge sand table. He Ming and officers above battalion level were overlooking the entire sand table from a slightly elevated viewing platform nearby. This sand table was made based on electronic maps brought from the old spacetime plus field survey corrections by the Special Reconnaissance Team and Exploration Team. It was not only accurate in scale but also expressed details to a hair-raising degree—this was made by a group of scale model enthusiasts; even a bridge or a village on the sand table—though pitifully small—had weathering treatment.

This sand table represented the terrain from Lingao to Qiongshan County. This area was condensed on this huge sand table.

Where to engage the suppressing Ming army was the first question the General Staff had to decide.

He Ming and most of his officers believed defending within the territory was unfeasible. The Fubo Army must crush the Ming army outside Lingao while ensuring most captives could be caught.

The first option was a battle near Qiongshan County City. The Fubo Army would use ships and land marching maneuverability to appear suddenly under Qiongshan County City while the Ming army had just assembled and hadn't established a firm foothold, routing the entire He Ming army. The routed enemy would inevitably retreat into Qiongshan County City, and the Fubo Army would then break the city to capture prisoners.

The biggest advantage of this plan was fewer captives escaping, ensuring most routed soldiers were captured. The disadvantage was that troops had to carry heavy weapons and supplies for a hundred kilometers to Qiongshan. Although ships could transport some, troops still had to carry necessary equipment. Soldiers would be very exhausted after this long march.

Finally, if Qiongshan was broken, Great Ming would lose a prefecture and county. Moreover, Qiongshan was the capital county of Qiongzhou Prefecture; the shock of losing the prefectural city was far greater than a county city. Furthermore, there was an Surveillance Vice Commissioner and Sub-prefectural Magistrate of Hainan inside Qiongshan City. On the day the city broke, the one committing suicide for the country wouldn't just be a simple seventh-rank magistrate, but also the Qiongzhou Prefect, the Hainan Sub-prefectural Magistrate, and other important officials. This matter would become very big.

So this plan was quickly rejected.

The second plan was under the walls of Chengmai County City, relying on You Laohu's camp to defeat the Ming army. The marching distance could be shortened. The disadvantage was that some Ming troops would flee towards Qiongshan, some into Chengmai, and some scatter in all directions.

The third plan was at the mountain pass south of Ma'ao (Maniao). Ambush on mountains on both sides, using Ma'ao Small Round City as a frontal support point, hoping to capture most Ming troops on the battlefield. The advantage was that our side would be waiting at ease, and battlefield facilities were very comprehensive. The disadvantage was that routed Ming troops might flee into Lingao territory.

After evaluation, everyone believed meeting the enemy within Chengmai territory was a relatively ideal choice. The geographical location here was moderate; the Fubo Army's maneuvering distance wasn't long, not consuming too much transport capacity, and evacuating wounded and captives was also convenient.

For the government army to attack Lingao, given their mobility and logistics, they would inevitably advance via the postal road.

Coming out of Qiongshan County City, the postal road passed through Binlian, Yelie, Beipu, Daotang, and then to Chengmai County City. The Fubo Army could intercept the government army at any point on this postal road.
