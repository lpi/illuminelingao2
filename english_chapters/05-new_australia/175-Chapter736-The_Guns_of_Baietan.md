# Chapter 736 - The Guns of Bai'etan

The sun rose. Wen Desi stood on the poop deck of the Special Service Boat, hands clasped behind his back. A layer of golden morning sunlight enveloped him, making him radiate a dazzling glow. The indigenous naval officers and sailors stood by in attendance, respectful and silent. Wen Desi gazed at Guangzhou, filled with the heroic sentiment of "Gazing at the Wu hook, patting all the railings, no one understands the intent of the climber."

"Back in the place where we fought," Wen Desi whispered. Thinking of the days when he, Wang, and Xiao traveled back and forth through the wormhole to raise funds, he couldn't help but feel a thousand emotions—the scene of fleeing in embarrassment from Bai'etan years ago, rescued by Ran Yao and others with a few small-caliber rifles and shotguns, was still vivid in his mind.

Now, leading a fleet here, with the lives and property of the entire city's officials and people depending on his whim, he was visibly smug.

"Thinking back to when this old master's team first opened for business, with only a dozen people and seven or eight guns..." Wen Desi suddenly hummed a line from Peking Opera, which he wasn't actually familiar with—nothing expressed his mood better than these lyrics right now.

Chen Haiyang was originally below the poop deck. Not wanting to disturb Wen Desi's mood, he hadn't stepped forward. Unlike Wen Desi's emotional retrospection, he was considering how to proceed with the next step.

The battle had reached a stage where it transcended military scope and became a political war—the Task Force fighting all the way to Guangzhou wasn't to capture this major East Asian city, but to force the other side to sue for peace. How to apply enough pressure to achieve their goals without causing the opponent to desperate "break the fishnet"—the balance had to be struck very accurately.

"General Wen," Chen Haiyang called out when he saw Wen Desi's nostalgia fading. "How do you think we should proceed next?"

The Senate had no intention of occupying Guangzhou. They wanted reopened trade, to continue obtaining manpower, material resources, and markets from Guangdong. For this, they couldn't scare away the wealthy merchants of Guangzhou—according to Intelligence Bureau reports, many wealthy merchants had already fled. If they truly conquered Guangzhou, the entire Pearl River Delta would become a "war zone." If merchants dared not come, occupying the city would be meaningless.

Wen Desi and Chen Haiyang had racked their brains all the way, thinking of how to make a big splash without causing the Guangdong government to completely shut the door on negotiations.

Now that warships were at Bai'etan, peace talks had to start immediately—though the Pearl River Expedition had achieved great results, if it failed to achieve peace, it would be a complete strategic failure.

Chen Haiyang suggested: Should we immediately send someone into Guangzhou to deliver a diplomatic note, demanding city officials come out to negotiate?

"No, we can't do notes—wouldn't that establish a 'Two-Nation Theory'? Li Fengjie wouldn't dare accept such a note if you beat him to death." Wen Desi shook his head repeatedly. "We can only transmit messages through private contact! Officials have their own ways of dealing with their superiors; we must find a channel of contact quickly."

The Foreign Intelligence Bureau had Lin Baiguang and others lurking in Guangzhou, so the Task Force received daily telegrams forwarded from Lingao about the situation inside the city.

"Li Fengjie tried to contact Gao Ju several times, but Gao Ju refused. I think we can ask the Intelligence Bureau to contact Gao Ju and let him act as the middleman," Wen Desi said. "Gao Ju has always been the agent for Australian goods; he can't shed that skin. It's reasonable for him to come forward."

"Let's fire a few blank shots first to scare them," Chen Haiyang said. "I don't believe the lord bureaucrats in the city can play deaf and dumb."

Gao Ju closed his doors to guests. Whoever came to call, the answer was "not at home." This wasn't putting on airs—it was simply that his position was awkward, making it difficult to face any party.

After Guo Yi and the others fled and the Purple properties were seized, Gao Ju felt he had lost significant face. He had unhappily written a letter reporting the events to Eunuch Yang. Although Eunuch Yang had little say in the palace now, a centipede doesn't topple even when dead; his connections were wide. If he caught an opportunity, he might severely damage the Tian family.

After the defeat at Chengmai, some gentry and officials secretly lobbied, hoping he would come forward to negotiate peace. Resenting the government for making him lose face and credit over the Purple properties, and unsure of the depth of the water behind this matter, he dared not agree casually. He simply played "not at home," hiding in his mansion to watch changes quietly.

Though housebound, his outside news was extremely well-informed. He knew all the Task Force's "deeds" entering the Pearl River, which both alarmed and delighted him. Alarmed that the Australians were so formidable, defeating suppressing government troops and chasing them all the way into the inland river, pointing their swords straight at Guangzhou—if a major battle erupted under Guangzhou's walls, this merchant's "paradise" would be ruined. Delighted that he hadn't stood on the wrong side in this "Extermination of Bandits" test. Whether dealing with the government or Australians, he had managed passably—with the Australians making a comeback, the Gao family could continue making a fortune on Australian goods.

As the Australians approached Guangzhou with growing momentum, he fully understood their intention—they wanted to "force peace through war."

Since they wanted "peace," there had to be a contact channel. Gao Ju believed no one in Guangdong was more suitable to be this channel than himself. Whether the government or the Australians, if they wanted to negotiate, they had to find him to mediate.

So for the past month, he resumed the "at home" status, though seeing few guests and saying little. He was "waiting for the right price," preparing to fiercely slaughter the government and local gentry—and if possible, the Australians too.

Gao Ju closely watched every move outside. When the Australian fleet pressed closer and the city panicked, with big families fleeing, he remained unmoved—he had a premonition the Australians wouldn't attack Guangzhou, at most posturing outside the city.

He had decided to wait until government people came to ask him to negotiate again before emerging. Of course, they must agree to his series of conditions first. He wanted not only to regain face for himself but also for the Australians—and naturally, to vent his anger. Thinking of that kid Tian Da's rude and arrogant manner before him, Master Gao couldn't swallow his rage.

That day, having just risen and eaten breakfast alone, he went to the courtyard to tease his birds—Gao Ju loved raising birds. Unlike the Northern style focusing on "sound," he prioritized beauty and colorful plumage. He collected many rare birds unseen in China from Western lands, hanging them under the eaves—a colorful, beautiful sight.

 amidst this harmonious scene of man and bird enjoying each other, rumbling cannon fire suddenly sounded outside. Several small birds immediately crashed around in their cages in fright. Gao Ju frowned, looking towards the sound—it was the direction of Bai'etan.

Apart from flower boats and restaurants, where would big guns come from in Bai'etan? Could the Australians have arrived? While Gao Ju wondered, a servant ran in hurriedly to report: "The Australian fleet has arrived at Bai'etan and is firing blank shots."

"Let them fire." Gao Ju looked indifferent—this was just knocking on the mountain to startle the tiger.

"Master," the servant said hesitantly, "Master Tian is here to visit..."

"Which Master Tian?"

"Tian Da—"

Gao Ju snorted: "Not home." He couldn't be bothered to see that despicable wretch.

"He refuses to leave, insisting on seeing you once," the servant, having taken bribe money as usual, continued to plead, "He says he has a great fortune to give to the Master."

"Not seeing," Gao Ju said plainly. Then he looked at the servant mockingly. "How much silver did you take from him?"

"This lowly one didn't..." The servant was shocked, rushing to deny.

"Go to the accounting room, say I said it: reward you with eight taels of silver. Throw Tian Da's four taels back at him!" Gao Ju said expressionlessly.

"Lowly one dares not, dares not." The servant was frightened out of his wits, kneeling and kowtowing. "Lowly one knows his mistake..."

"Go."

He didn't know why Tian Da insisted on seeing him, but he could guess. Tian Da failed completely in attempting to swallow the Purple properties in Guangzhou—first Guo the Proprietor and others disappeared strangely. That was fine, as Tian Da could at least get the remaining real estate, but the government dragged its feet. When news of the Chengmai disaster arrived, even outsiders knew Tian Da had no hope.

Tian Da had been in Guangzhou for nearly a year. He had boasted he could secure the Purple enterprise's submission for his master, but now had nothing. If he returned to report like this, he likely couldn't keep his job as a Tian family servant. Recently, he collected various Australian goods and treasures everywhere, probably to have some excuse when he returned.

Tian Da ate a closed-door rebuke at Gao Ju's house. The gatekeeper who had taken his silver with smiles and promises came back with a cold face, threw the silver back at him, said "Not at home," and spoke no more.

Tian Da cursed: "Damn it, everyone's eaten a bear heart and leopard gall!" Guangzhou City was truly unstayable. These officials and gentry flipped faces faster than turning pages. Originally, no one dared refuse his visits; at worst, they would come out to greet him and gift tens of taels. Now, no figure with any background would see him. Even if they did, they spoke rudely, let alone giving gifts.

The Purple Enterprise was hopeless—when yamen runners seized the property after the Australians fled, Tian Da hadn't spent much effort to get inside for a "tour." The result disappointed him. Though much goods and equipment remained, the runners had looted everything. Besides common tools, only some inexplicable Australian machines remained. Their delicate brass and glass parts were either stolen or damaged by rough runners during sealing. Without Australian craftsmen, they were impossible to repair or use. He also learned those people left calmly, leaving not a single scrap of paper.

Even if these businesses fell into his hands, they were useless without a buyer willing to take over! Who had the skill to revive them? Everything they sold was Australian goods, or made with Australian secret recipes. Not to mention how to make that sweet water that numbed the mouth and had bubbles—no one in Guangzhou knew. Or the ice blocks available anytime in summer...

"Gao Ju, that damned old fox." Tian Da cursed as he left. He wanted to extort a few rare Australian goods from Gao Ju to report back, since the plan to seize the Purple Tower failed. With Bandits pressing close, Tian Da felt uneasy—he had long thought of returning north.

But Gao Ju was impervious to soft or hard tactics, ignoring him completely. He wanted to get that bright Australian oil lamp to present to the palace, but the man wouldn't even see him, making Tian Da feel very ashamed.

"Go to the Liu family." Sitting in his sedan chair, Tian Da decided to visit the Liu merchant family. They had no power and traded northwards; reportedly they had several rare Australian treasures. This family had deep ties with Australians; they wouldn't dare not submit. After succeeding, he would leave Guangzhou immediately. He heard the guns at Bai'etan too. While the gates were still open, he had to flee. Falling into Australian hands would mean no good end.

While he calculated how to extort the Liu family in the sedan chair, someone suddenly shouted: "Bull going mad! Run!"

Just as Tian Da was about to look out, the sedan chair hit the ground with a "bang," nearly throwing him out. Tian Da cursed: "You dogs! Can't even carry a chair..."

The bearers had fled. As Tian Da stuck his head out the window, he saw a robust water buffalo, panting heavily, charging straight at the sedan chair with two massive horns.

Tian Da screamed and collapsed in the chair.

A crisp "crack" of bone shattering was the last sound Tian Da heard on earth.

Tian Da's death caused not a ripple in Guangzhou—except among those who knew of his enmity with the Australians. Those who had flattered him felt guilty; those who suffered from him cheered secretly. Gao Ju only smiled slightly upon hearing it.

While the city staged its drama, the Task Force outside wasn't idle. The Fubo Army landed at Bai'etan, commandeering several restaurants as headquarters and senior officer quarters, building a temporary naval pier on the trestles where flower boats used to dock. Many rocket launchers and Hale Rockets were unloaded and set up outside the city. If the officials inside lacked urgency for peace, Wen Desi prepared to remind them with rockets.

To facilitate shelling Guangzhou from all directions, all Bombardment Boats were temporarily modified, removing 280mm mortars and installing rocket launchers. This allowed them to maneuver along Bai'etan and inland waterways to bombard Guangzhou from any direction.

Over three hundred Hale rockets were brought from Hong Kong. Wen Desi decided to give Li Fengjie three days; no response meant a big fireworks show.

Some Senators suggested using the intelligence system inside the city to send "relations" to ask Gao Ju to propose peace to Li Fengjie.

"Peace is better proposed by the other side first. Besides, if we ask Gao Ju, he might get arrogant and claim credit later to demand greater benefits from us," Wen Desi said. "Let's wait a few days and see their reaction."

To avoid attack from front and rear, Chen Haiyang ordered a mixed battalion of Marines and sailors with artillery to expel defenders from the key points of Phoenix Hill in the west and Dongsheng Temple in the east. The enemy was cleared in less than a day. Defenders at both places fled without fierce fighting, leaving 90 corpses and over 200 various old guns. Fubo Army casualties were 10, with 3 killed.

The fall of Phoenix Hill and Dongsheng Temple made Guangzhou's defensive situation even more passive. Li Fengjie had no choice; he had to make up his mind about the peace negotiations he had been hesitant about.

Li Fengjie thought the biggest obstacle was Gao Shunqin. If he knew, he would vehemently oppose it—perhaps even impeach immediately. As a Censor, he could report "hearsay" into memorials. If public opinion in the Capital rose, Li Fengjie would be in deep trouble.

After careful consideration, he decided not to come forward personally, splitting the task into two paths: Guangzhou Prefect Yu Baocun would handle local matters directly—since he had the primary responsibility for defending the soil, he wouldn't dare refuse.

The other path would be handled by Li Luoyou in Macau. Macau was Portuguese territory; talks could be frank. Things that could only be hinted at before Yu Baocun could be spoken clearly to Li Luoyou.

Currently, the priority was for Yu Baocun and Gao Ju to persuade the Australians to withdraw quickly, then discuss other conditions in Macau. The longer Australian warships stayed, the harder it was to explain to the Court.

Yu Baocun went to the Governor's Yamen for a secret midnight meeting. Early the next morning, he personally took a sedan chair to see Gao Ju.

"Is this the Governor's intent?" Gao Ju asked after hearing Yu Baocun's request for him to negotiate the "Bandit" withdrawal.

"Elder Gao is wise; must this student speak it plainly?" Yu Baocun smiled bitterly. "Defending the soil is a duty; we are all involuntary. This matter relies heavily on Elder Gao."

"Where does the Old Ancestor speak from," Gao Ju feigned indifference. "Gao is but a merchant. I fear my ability is insufficient."

Yu Baocun cursed the old man for posturing; he was bound to ask a sky-high price. But needing his help, he signaled that as long as Gao came forward, everything was negotiable.
