# Chapter 711 - Entering the Pearl River

The "Yong'an Ju" teahouse was bustling with patrons as usual. Guangzhou's teahouses were different from those in Jiangnan or the capital. Not only were the dim sum selections refined, but the teahouses also featured high, airy spaces—most were two or three stories tall. The ground floor was as high as a typical two-story building. Mid-Autumn Festival was approaching, and every teahouse had hung a mooncake signboard in its main hall—seven and a half *chi* tall and four and a half *chi* wide. These signboards were quite impressive: intricately carved with classical figures, flowers, birds, insects, and fish. The workmanship was exquisite, and many even had gold leaf applied. They looked splendid and magnificent.

Teahouses had always been places where people of various trades gathered to discuss business. Though the main hall invariably displayed a red paper notice stating "No Discussion of State Affairs," many such "state affairs" were not only discussed here—some were even decided in such places.

According to custom, people of different status and occupation didn't sit together for tea. Within the teahouses, separate "halls" formed distinct worlds. One hall called "Tingquan"—"Listening to the Spring"—was frequented by men in servants' blue robes and small caps. Though they were servants, they weren't the sort who endured beatings and abuse. No one in Guangzhou dared look down on them: they were all trusted attendants, doormen, and close servants of various high officials and nobles—everyone wielding considerable influence, with words that could reach their masters' ears directly. Matters that couldn't be resolved through proper channels at the yamens could often be smoothly handled here—with the right person approached and the right silver offered.

It was morning now, the teahouse's busiest time. Not only was the ground-floor hall completely full, but the second and third floors were more than half-occupied. Every hall entrance was noisy with the clamor of voices, peddlers hawking their wares, and singers performing—all mixing together in apparent chaos yet vibrant energy.

Amid the bustling, noisy atmosphere, a young man sat drinking tea at a table. Several small bamboo steamer baskets sat before him, containing the teahouse's most seasonally appropriate dim sum. The young man didn't look around conspicuously, yet his eyes occasionally flicked toward the main entrance.

Before long, a short middle-aged man entered through the hall door. His eyes swept the room and immediately spotted the solitary young man. He walked over and sat down heavily. A waiter hurried over to pour water and brew tea.

"Drink tea." The young man reached for the teapot to pour for him.

"No need for formality!" The newcomer had an air of self-importance. "Did you bring the money?"

"Of course. A Delong promissory note, redeemable on sight, accepted province-wide." The young man lowered his voice as he drew a paper note from his sleeve. Intricate patterns, color printing, crisp paper—unmistakably a Delong note. Such notes were impossible to counterfeit.

The middle-aged man examined it. Clearly a Delong note for fifty taels, redeemable on sight throughout the province. A smile appeared at the corner of his mouth:

"Good, brother—you're a straightforward man!" He slid a small bundle from beneath the table. "What you asked for is all inside."

The young man nodded, opened a corner of the bundle, and examined it carefully. Inside were several small folding memo books, each with tiny paper labels attached. The young man studied the contents closely and nodded only when he was certain everything was authentic.

"Don't worry, it's all genuine." The middle-aged man ate a shrimp dumpling and smiled. "These things aren't exactly rare treasures, but they're stored in His Lordship's private study. Ordinary people can't get in—every step costs money..."

The middle-aged man took the note and stuffed it into his boot. He rambled on about how difficult this job had been—evidently trying to demonstrate that the bundle was quite reasonably priced.

"Consider this the beginning of our friendship. If there are future matters, I hope I can trouble you again." The young man nodded as he spoke.

"Of course, of course." The middle-aged man drank his tea hastily and left.

The bundle contained copies of Gao Shunqin's memorials from the past month, plus draft copies of his correspondence with people in the capital. For a high provincial official, these were extremely confidential materials, typically stored securely in one's private study, never entrusted to advisors for safekeeping. But as the saying goes, "You can guard against daytime thieves, but never against household thieves." Given enough money, even his concubines and servants could be bribed to secretly copy them out.

The bundle of copies quickly passed through a courier station to Lin Baoguang. After carefully reviewing them and eliminating irrelevant portions, he swiftly reached a conclusion. Gao Shunqin's longtime campaign to expel the Portuguese from Macau had finally been formally set in motion.

What interested Lin Baoguang most wasn't the memorials themselves. For a matter to gain approval and become an imperial edict, a single memorial alone wouldn't suffice. Extensive preparation was needed beforehand—communicating with Grand Secretaries, various ministry officials, and securing political support. Some involved persuasion on policy grounds; others concerned exchanges of interest. In the late Ming, there were also factional struggles to consider.

By comparison, private correspondence—exchanging opinions and commissioning actions—held great reference value. By reading such letters, one could roughly assess how a particular matter was progressing.

---

Based on these letters, Gao Shunqin had largely completed all preparatory work. Once this memorial was submitted, approval was highly likely. First, ancients had little understanding of maritime trade's true significance. Second, the Portuguese and their partners were hardly gentle souls—trade was often accompanied by naked robbery, killing, and arson.

Taking everything into account, the Chongzhen Emperor issuing an edict next year prohibiting Portuguese trade would probably occur as in historical record.

The question was: why was Li Fengjie showing such unusual anxiety about this matter? Portuguese trading rights had no intersection with his interests whatsoever. He was so concerned about the Portuguese that if news of this were confirmed by them, his request would be refused.

Lin Baoguang couldn't figure out what could make Li Fengjie so invested in the Portuguese attitude. In the old timeline—at least during the Ming dynasty—the Portuguese could be considered "obedient" to Guangdong's local officials. Even the minor Xiangshan County Deputy had once marched boldly into Macau, dragged Portuguese members of the Macau Senate into court, and had them publicly caned.

Fresh intelligence soon arrived: Li Fengjie's envoy to Macau wasn't one of his own advisors but an old acquaintance of the transmigrators—Li Luoyou.

Li Luoyou had lived in Macau since childhood, studied under the Jesuits, and had very close ties with the Portuguese. He also had close connections with officialdom. When Wang Zunde wanted to cast cannons in Guangdong using Portuguese cannons as models, Li Luoyou had handled everything personally. That Li Fengjie would now send him to liaise with the Portuguese was entirely expected.

Lin Baoguang decided to immediately cable Lingao, asking Jiang Shan and the others to have Gu Baocheng arrange someone in Macau to contact Li Luoyou and uncover the specific inside story.

On September 20th, after several days of rest and waiting for reinforcements and supplies to arrive, Chen Haiyang finally launched the operation to enter the Pearl River's inland waters. Led by the survey ship *Haitian*, he commanded the special expeditionary force out of the Sham Shui anchorage and into the Pearl River proper.

From the Pearl River Estuary into the inland waterways and up to Guangzhou, there were two routes. One was the outer route: proceeding upriver from east of Macau, passing through the Bogue, crossing two sandbanks, and arriving directly at Huangpu. This was the primary route for ordinary merchant vessels heading to Guangzhou. Navigation conditions were relatively good.

The other was called the "inner route": proceeding upriver from west of Macau, crossing the "Hengsha Shoal," then arriving at Xiangshan. From Xiangshan, one continued upriver through the Bogue to Huangpu. Since this route passed many shoals and tributaries, it was generally used only by smaller vessels.

Chen Haiyang had *Haitian's* survey data and various information from local sailors and veteran boatmen. He decided to take only the outer route for this first voyage, ensuring the ships' safety. His ultimate destination for this voyage was the Bogue. If possible, he would establish a stronghold there to secure this strategic point, eliminating the need to fight through it every time they went to Guangzhou.

The fleet, with the twin-masted survey ship *Haitian* in the lead, weighed anchor at Sham Shui and sailed past the waters east of Macau. It was a perfect autumn day with gentle breezes. The freshly scrubbed ships from the Sham Shui anchorage sailed in formation under full canvas. Red imperial flags with golden streamers rose on the mainmasts; numerous banners fluttered in the wind. Cannons thundered; bugles sounded. A squadron of steam-powered landing craft puffed thick black smoke as they advanced on the fleet's flanks. Behind them came clusters of small boats towed by the landing craft. Marine flags flew proudly.

The Portuguese at Macau knew this was the Australian fleet—a few days earlier, the Macau Senate had sent envoys to Hong Kong Island, where both sides had exchanged gifts and opinions. Due to the transmigrators' support for Jesuit mission work in Lingao and their trade with the Society of Jesus, the Portuguese weren't unfamiliar with them. What worried them was the Australians' sudden appearance at the Pearl River Estuary—not only had they routed a pirate gang here, but they had also built fortifications on Hong Kong Island.

Chen Haiyang assured them: the Australian fleet had no designs whatsoever on Macau. Though fearful and not entirely trusting of the Australians' guarantees, the disparity in power left the Portuguese no choice but to greet these newcomers peacefully. They even permitted Australian small vessels to enter Macau for supplies.

Chen Haiyang noted that Macau's harbor held four large galleons plus five or six smaller vessels. In terms of scale, Portuguese naval strength in East Asia was indeed formidable. If not for the advantages of modern weaponry, propulsion, and vessels, relying on traditional ships and weapons alone, they might not be a match.

In the distance, smoke puffed from a fort, followed by rumbling cannon fire. The Portuguese were firing salutes.

The Macau forts fired their salutes, followed by the Portuguese ships in harbor firing in unison. The fleet responded with salutes of its own. The entire Pearl River Estuary roiled with white smoke and thundering guns—announcing the transmigration faction's formal arrival on the mainland.
