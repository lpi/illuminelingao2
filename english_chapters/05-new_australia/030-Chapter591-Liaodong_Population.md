# Chapter 591 - Liaodong Population

"If that's the case, we can diffuse light industry; why diffuse a gun factory? Ordinary people won't visit that often."

"My opinion is to sell Li Luoyou a complete set of silk reeling equipment..."

"I think processing supplied materials is good; earning money and raw materials while letting apprentices practice!"

"Bullshit—"

The two sides didn't argue much on technical issues, but almost fought over whether to sell equipment and how to sell it.

"Forget it, everyone stop arguing!" Huang Tianyu appeared at the office door with a look of dismay. "He doesn't want it anymore!"

"What?!" Everyone was startled. Whether supporting or opposing, this news was like ice water. Of all things manufactured by Lingao industry, some sold hot, some sold average, but no one had ever disliked them enough not to want them! In everyone's mind, Lingao Manufacturing equaled "German Manufacturing" of the old spacetime.

Now this native tycoon actually said he didn't want it! Several people who had originally opposed selling machines most fiercely also felt a sense of loss. It felt like a woman you didn't like kept pestering you to go to bed, claiming you could ravage and play with her, but now suddenly she wouldn't even let you touch her breasts. Emotionally, it was extremely disappointing.

"Why not buy it?"

"Heard he thought it was expensive." Huang Tianyu sat down on a box of parts.

"Who said that?" The people who originally actively opposed selling machines became even more disappointed—fifty thousand taels of silver gone!

"Liu San said it. The formal notification should come very soon."

A few minutes later, the phone in the Mechanical Factory rang. The secretary of the Manufacturing Director's Office notified Zhan Wuya that Secretary Chuyu of the Planning Agency Office had just formally notified the cancellation of the simplified gun factory equipment order.

The Political Security Bureau was brightly lit—this courtyard kept lights on even at midnight. Secret police—in any spacetime—were accustomed to working at night. The sound of telephone rings, talking, and the heavy tapping of Chinese typewriters came from the courtyard.

Ufo held the latest wiretap report just organized and typed before midnight. Over a dozen indigenous clerks sat in a room partitioned into small cubicles. Each cubicle was installed with thick glass plates and sound-absorbing panels filled with kapok. Every monitor understood at least two dialects: Cantonese, Hainanese, Leizhou dialect, Hainan Military dialect, Hakka, Lingao dialect... Any dialect anyone spoke in this area, someone here understood. They concentrated on listening to voices recorded by various devices: computer microphones, tape recorders, recording pens... playing out, then dipping iron-tipped pens in ink to record the conversation content in notebooks before them.

These voices were played through dozens of cheap computer active speakers purchased in bulk for over ten yuan each. Each recording room had one installed, carefully placed in a wooden protective box.

The recorded wiretap reports were sent to the typing room, where they were transcribed and typed clearly. Typing used several heavy Chinese typewriters. Not brought from the old spacetime, but locally imitated; because materials weren't quite up to standard, they were even more clumsy, big, black, and rough than the originals. However, in typing speed, the indigenous typists quickly proved they were much better than the Chiefs.

To save equipment life, the Political Security Bureau only installed bugs in a few places. Although installation locations were confidential, the Elders could basically guess: the Commercial Hall definitely had them, the County Yamen had them, the County School and Jasmine Pavilion had them, and the small teahouse opposite the County Yamen was full of bugs. Runshitang's East Guest Courtyard could also be monitored at any time.

Whether Yang Shixiang or the distinguished guests of Runshitang living inside, no one knew there were inter-layers and secret passages in this house that they didn't know about. Monitoring equipment could be installed into the inter-layer walls at any time if needed.

99% of wiretap reports were useless. Useful materials involving civilian comments were bound into volumes and given to the Propaganda Department for reference; those involving complaints against grassroots staff and corruption were given to the Cheka; general crimes to the National Police... Finally, wiretap reports involving "serious situations" were handed to the General Bureau Investigation Division for processing.

Even ordinary gossip and domestic trivia, as long as they involved keywords, had to be handed to specialized teams for processing. These keywords were mainly Ming officials like the County Magistrate, local big landlords, names of pirates active nearby, etc. These people had files in the PSB, and conversation content involving them was filed into their respective dossiers under the "Rumors" category.

Regardless of the processing result, the original manuscripts of all reports had to be archived. Zhao Manxiong emphasized repeatedly in work meetings: to do security work well, the first thing is to establish a complete database.

Ufo flipped through these reports, first taking out the report from Runshitang East Guest Courtyard—Li Luoyou's arrival raised the monitoring level there from "General Attention" to "Key Attention."

He read for a few minutes, frowning tight. This Advisor Han spoke with ill intent! Obviously not planning to let this deal succeed! He hurriedly called the Ministry of Commerce.

"The Ministry of Commerce has closed. Shall I transfer to the duty room?" The operator lady's voice on the phone was sweet, still carrying an accent in her Mandarin.

"Oh, no need!" Ufo remembered then that it was midnight; discussing business was impossible.

However, if the news was conveyed before work tomorrow, Li Mei still had a chance to readjust, including transaction conditions and such. This transaction was led by Wu De, and the relationship between the First Deputy Director and Wu De seemed not shallow. Ufo didn't dare neglect; he picked up his mobile phone to dial Wu De's number.

Wait! He felt it inappropriate. This matter was Wu De's idea, but many opposed it. Reporting directly to him was too naked.

Thinking of this, he decided not to call Wu De, but Li Mei. She was the direct leader responsible for this transaction and had great interest in it. She would definitely communicate with Wu De and come up with a new plan to salvage this deal.

From a business perspective, handling it this way fit procedure and couldn't be faulted.

However, her phone was off. Li Mei was nearly sixty; her sleep was light, and she wouldn't sleep with her mobile on—unless notified to do so.

He immediately ordered the report sealed and sent to the reception room. The envelope was marked "Copy to Li Mei, Ministry of Commerce."

"Urgent!" He stamped it and gave it to the clerk, "Deliver by 7 AM tomorrow!"

Ufo didn't know at this time that Li Luoyou had already clearly expressed to Liu San that evening that he didn't intend to buy the gun factory equipment, and the Planning Agency had already cancelled the order.

After listening to Advisor Han's words, Li Luoyou suddenly realized in horror he hadn't considered well: what would the future relationship between the government and Australians be like?

The government defaulted to their existence now, but wouldn't default forever. Li Luoyou knew too well the relationship between the government and various Europeans coming to Great Ming hoping to get rich. Europeans always expected to occupy a base on the Chinese coast for long-term nearby business. The local government initially ignored it, but when things blew up and could no longer be covered up locally, they would send troops to expel them.

Generally speaking, until now, except for the Portuguese, no foreign group could occupy a place on the coast for long. Although the Dutch occupied a place in Taiwan, they were ultimately driven out of Penghu.

This knot lingered in his mind, causing him much headache. He decided that before the relationship between Australians and the government became clear, he should get involved as little as possible—Australians could just leave, but he had a family; he couldn't run even if he wanted to.

Finally, he decided he didn't need to be so anxious to serve the country loyally, lest he be labeled "Australian lackey" or "treacherous merchant" when fighting started, possibly requiring huge bribes to Guangdong officials to pass the ordeal.

When Liu San learned the deal was blown, his first reaction was disbelief. Then he saw Advisor Han's incredibly calm face—no expression on it, yet Liu San felt he was laughing at him.

He didn't know if he should report the fact that Advisor Han visited to solicit a bribe and was refused. He had a feeling that writing this report would likely make him the scapegoat for the transaction failure.

He didn't report the bribe solicitation in time that day. If responsibility was pursued, he was obviously the primary responsible person—even though no one in the Transmigration Group would agree to such bribery.

Liu San's mood instantly became terrible. After repeated consideration, he decided to omit this part in the report, only writing that Advisor Han visited to request a price reduction. Not lowering the price was a directive from above; he had executed it faithfully. Anyway, Advisor Han wouldn't speak of the bribe solicitation himself.

Although Li Luoyou's arms deal didn't happen, both parties were generally satisfied with this transaction. On one hand, money is always the more the better; on the other hand, two supply channels were obtained. Li Luoyou's supply prices were cheaper than Gao Ju and Huang Shunlong. Especially for bulk goods.

Most importantly, Li Luoyou agreed that as long as they needed, he could arrange for them to go to Jiangnan and provide necessary assistance.

However, this assistance could only be covert, not open.

As for the Capital (Beijing), it was inconvenient to go for now. The reason, Li Luoyou told them clearly: The transmigrators' accents were too strange.

"Best change this accent. The language you gentlemen speak resembles Liaodong accent; it's too conspicuous in the Capital." There were many patrolling spies in the Capital; any trivial matter would be reported to the Eastern Depot. If some idle spy interrogated them, he couldn't bear the risk.

As for going to Liaodong, Li Luoyou expressed that going to look and do business was fine, but he couldn't take responsibility for long-term stationing.

"Han people have a hard life on Tartar ground! Even Fan Wencheng, a pseudo-Grand Secretary who rendered great service to the Tartars, was almost killed by the Old Tartar just because he was Han. You are so conspicuous; you absolutely can't stay."

Speaking of the plight of Han people in Liaodong, Li Luoyou inevitably sighed and lamented, describing the suffering of Liaodong Han people. Finally, he mentioned the breaching of the Wall and major looting last year, taking away over a hundred thousand men and women from inside the Pass; unknown how many survived now.

"Generals incompetent, commoners suffer! Commoners eat bran and vegetables, sell sons and daughters to pay imperial grain tax, yet they feed such a bunch of useless rice buckets!" Li Luoyou had turned from reverence to hatred for Supervisor Yuan by now. His words were full of curses. Liu San thought, regardless of whether Yuan Chonghuan died wrongfully, public opinion at the time was definitely extremely unfavorable to him.

"...The Tartars simply don't have grain to feed so many people!" Li Luoyou said indignantly, "When the Old Tartar was alive, grain wasn't enough, so they simply killed Han people to reduce mouths. When Huang Taiji became the Pseudo Khan, he showed some leniency to Han people, but grain is still insufficient—"

grain insufficient, so they offered high prices to buy from inside the Pass, willing to pay ten or even over ten taels for a *shi* of rice, several times more expensive than Central Plains market prices. Useless women and children were sold directly to Mongolia in exchange for cattle and sheep.

He had personal pain and traded in Liaodong for a long time; the miserable state of Liaodong Han people and captives was witnessed with his own eyes yet he was powerless. Speaking of it was extremely painful.

Li Luoyou vented a bit, then thought he was in Lingao talking about this with a group of overseas people; they weren't Great Ming subjects at all. He immediately stopped talking, cupping his hands: "Lost my composure, forgive me! Forgive me!"

Thinking that since the Tartars were eager to sell captives due to lack of grain, his side could totally go buy them. Women and children whom Tartars didn't want and Mongols wouldn't pay high prices for were needed in Lingao. In the Operation Willow meeting before Li Luoyou's arrival, buying Liaodong population was also discussed.

" regarding this matter, we are willing to relieve the suffering of the common people." Liu San said.

"Oh? What is your intention?"

"If the Tartars can't feed so many people and want to sell them, we will just go buy them—"

Li Luoyou's eyes lit up. This Master San spoke well; Australians, no matter what, always considered themselves descendants of Hua-Xia. Lingao was Great Ming territory. Arriving in Lingao was a hundred times better than falling into Mongol hands. However, he shook his head again:

"This matter is difficult!" He warned, "The Tartars are very cunning! They absolutely won't sell young men, only women, children, and the old and weak... With my meager face, redeeming a dozen young men at once is possible, but a large batch is hard."

He didn't continue; Australians weren't doing charity purely after all. They wouldn't necessarily spend big money to bring back many women, children, and elderly who couldn't do heavy work from thousands of miles away.

"We want women, children, and the elderly too; saving one is one." Liu San put on an incarnation of justice. Women—Lingao had a gender imbalance; getting more women could balance the gender ratio. Besides, women had great use in light industry. As for children, they were the human resources transmigrators liked best—nothing accepted new things easier than children bearing strong hatred.

"Master San is truly righteous as the clouds." Li Luoyou praised highly, "However, what Tartars value most are iron tools and grain. I see these in the thirty-one goods you guarantee to buy; presumably your own needs are insufficient. How can you have spare power to redeem? I fear this is difficult."

"Only grain and iron tools?" Liu San was instantly poured with cold water. He asked with hope: "Can we sell other items?"

"Although Huang Taiji is a Tartar, his insight is not bad." Li Luoyou said, "Merchants shipping things in to sell, he only welcomes materials for people's livelihood and state use. Grain and iron tools are best; cloth and silk are also fine. But things like your glass mirrors, purely for enjoyment, I fear selling them will be banned once shipped in."

"So it's like that." Liu San thought this was tricky. Exporting strategic materials required Executive Committee approval. "Then we have to plan differently."

"If you have such intentions, Li is willing to bridge the connection."

"Sorry to trouble Proprietor Li!"

Both sides agreed: within the next three months, he would arrange for a few Elders to secretly go to Liaodong for on-site reconnaissance to see if it was possible to purchase captives from Liaodong in large batches.

Both sides used Li Luoyou's branch here as the contact point, with Gu Baocheng as the liaison. Other than this channel, no other contact would be made. Li Luoyou showed a pair of patterned ox horn seals. The two seals could form one or split into a pair. He left one.

"Whenever there is a letter or message, use this seal pattern as proof. Seeing the seal is like seeing the person."

In his daily operations, for secrecy, he used this method to contact all parties. It was a simple and effective way. Except for Saoye, his inner and outer studies each had two confidants keeping these ox horn seals with different patterns. As for who each seal corresponded to, only he knew.

Redeeming captives had no direct benefit for Li Luoyou and might not succeed, but it made his heart slightly smoother. His goodwill towards Australians also increased.

In the following days, Li Luoyou continued visiting everywhere in Lingao. Wu Nanhai's intensive farm left a deep impression on him. Then he visited the Catholic Church in East Gate Market—he discovered accidentally there was a church here—seeing people wearing wooden crosses on the road. Asking, he learned a church existed long ago. So at his request, a visit to the church was added temporarily.

At the East Gate Market Church, he received a warm welcome from Wu Shimang and others. Although Li Luoyou always felt an indescribable awkwardness towards this Australian priest. This man was dignified and behaved properly, much more decent than the smelly German priest Ma Yangchun who didn't like bathing, but his conversation really didn't feel like a priest's.

Father Bai (Bai Duolu) looked a bit more like it. Li Luoyou had a very good impression of the Australians allowing the church to build here, and hearing a monastery was established surprised him even more; it seemed Australians had great reverence for the Lord.

The church was not big, with a pointed roof, a small bell tower, and long glass windows on the walls. The architecture was simple and beautiful. Li Luoyou liked this church very much and donated circulation notes equivalent to one hundred taels on the spot. Wu Shimang expressed thanks and returned a Chinese version of "Catechism" as a gift. This was an introductory book for Catholics, printed extremely exquisitely with beautiful binding. Li Luoyou appreciated it greatly, immediately donating another hundred taels of silver for printing this book. And expressed willingness to purchase five hundred copies.
