# Chapter 684 - The People of the Order

"That strange Italian?" Trigault said with displeasure. "I think he's a suspicious person."

Accompanying him to Lingao besides Weiss Rando was a young cleric named Cecilio. He was a student of Trigault's—a brother who held him in great respect.

Traveling with their party to Lingao would be a great deal of cargo. Besides the various goods sold to Lingao according to the supply agreement, there were also Jesuit gifts: sacred vessels for the church, decorative items, crucifixes, stained glass paintings, large cast-iron chandeliers, candlesticks, and all manner of sculptures—a dazzling array. Many items had been purchased from the Philippines or even Europe. Father Trigault—or by his newly adopted Chinese name, Jin Lige—looked at this long cargo manifest in amazement.

"We're shipping all this?"

"Another new church is being completed in Lingao. They're also planning to expand the main church and monastery there."

"Since the Australians have their own church plus a church and monastery, and possess the finest craftsmen in the world, why must we provide everything?" Jin Lige found this hard to understand. "And three thousand small crucifixes—we provide those too?"

"Yes, that's part of the evangelization agreement."

"God!" Jin Lige made the sign of the cross. "Are they still lambs of the Lord?"

"Among the Australians, many are atheists." Father Comanach crossed himself at this word. "God preserve us. There are indeed believers in the Lord among them, but those who truly hold power are not among them."

Those holding power were a group of merchants more mercenary than any—this was Father Comanach's impression.

Jin Lige's face immediately went pale. In his mind, "atheists" were an even more terrifying existence than "heretics."

"However, their gentlemen are all courteous, learned and polite. Their hearts—" Comanach sighed regretfully. "May the Lord's light shine into their darkened hearts..."

"This is the highest secret of the Macao Jesuits." Father Comanach took a document from a locked file cabinet. "You may read it here and commit it to memory."

What Father Comanach handed him was a document secretly compiled based on Father Rodrigues's letters.

The *Letters from Lingao* circulated within the Church was not the complete version. Much critical content had been deleted by the Jesuits. The Society of Jesus had learned lessons from its Japanese mission experience and firmly refused to allow other orders to encroach on Hainan Island evangelization. They demanded not just exclusive missionary rights but also complete control of critical information.

This document concerned the religious situation and ideological tendencies of Lingao's rulers—the transmigrators.

One list detailed the main clergy of the Australian church and the Catholics and other religious adherents Father Rodrigues had identified among the Australians.

Catholics in Lingao, including those developed in the Li regions, now numbered over a thousand. Male and female religious brothers and sisters in the monastery also exceeded a hundred. But the Jesuits valued the Catholics among the Australians more highly—they were very aware that native believers played no role in Lingao's power structure.

Developing new believers among the transmigrators as much as possible was the Jesuits' urgent priority—this was also a major task assigned to Jin Lige. Only thus could the Society of Jesus have influence in the Australian Yuan Laoyuan.

"The Lingao church is currently under the jurisdiction of a monastery abbot named Wu Shimang. His official title is Prior of the Lingao Monastery." Father Comanach explained. "He too is a member of the Australian Yuan Laoyuan and enjoys aristocratic rights."

"Is he a devout believer?" The position of monastery prior, with its considerable income and complex property rights, was often associated with the Church's main corrupt elements in Europe.

"Ah, according to Brother Rodrigues's letters, Prior Wu is a capable monastery administrator. Very capable." Comanach said.

This meant he was expert at running the monastery but not particularly zealous about religion.

"Has he taken Holy Orders?"

"I believe not." Father Comanach smiled. "Brother Rodrigues says he doesn't seem like an ordained prior."

"Is he a secular prior?"

"Hard to say. We've never been able to clarify the Australian church's organizational specifics. They seem to have considerable informality." Comanach commented. "There's also his assistant, Father Bai Duoluo of the Bairen Church."

"Father Bai is a fine believer—he was Brother Rodrigues's assistant and contributed greatly to spreading the Gospel. He's also a theologian—he provided the Chinese-language *Catechism*."

"Thanks be to God."

"Miss Diana Mendoza. A devout believer."

Jin Lige felt disappointed: "Only these three?"

"Yes, according to Brother Rodrigues's letters, only these three among the Australian Yuan Laoyuan's transmigrators are lambs of the Lord." Comanach said, frowning. "There are also Puritans in the Yuan Laoyuan."

"God!" Jin Lige exclaimed.

"Two European women. Brother Rodrigues says they speak a strange kind of English."

"Are they English?"

"I don't think so. Apart from European features, their behavior and manners are no different from other Australians." Father Comanach said slowly. "Although they are heretics, they seem uninterested in religion..."

"Is there no Puritan place of worship?"

"No." Comanach sighed with some regret. "But they have another powerful heretical church. Called 'the Dao.'"

"Father Matteo Ricci mentioned it in his writings: a native Chinese idol worship..."

"Exactly. However, the Australians' 'Dao' temples contain no idols, as Father Rodrigues mentioned in his letters." Father Comanach said. "Unfortunately, the Australian transmigrators in Lingao seem rather partial to 'the Dao.'"

"Are they believers in 'the Dao'?"

"No, as I said, most are atheists."

"Which means their partiality to 'the Dao' is not from faith."

"Correct." Father Comanach said. "I believe the Australian transmigrators treat 'the Dao' less as a faith than as a tool of governance. The leader of 'the Dao' church is a young man surnamed Zhang. He possesses exquisite traditional Chinese medical skills, and through this has won the support of many followers. He's said to be especially popular in the savage regions—a major competitor on your path of spreading the Gospel."

"Unfortunately I don't know medicine."

"When it comes to medicine, neither Chinese nor ours can match the Australians'. What they need are artistic talents. The Australians lack painters, singers, and sculptors—ah, but according to Brother Rodrigues, Australia shouldn't lack such talents, yet they seem not to have come to Lingao. You are an artist, skilled in sculpture and painting. Brother Cecilio knows musical instruments. These will be very useful in Lingao—conducive to more contact with the Australians."

"Finally, I must alert you to a person named He Ying. In the Australians' secular government, his title is 'Religious Affairs Officer.' This is a very powerful position—it appears the Australians follow policies similar to the Dutch or Ottomans: allowing various faiths and heresies to spread within the country. He is the administrator and arbiter of all religious affairs." Father Comanach said. "Providing him with certain appropriate benefits will greatly advance the evangelical mission."

"Yes, but I've seen Brother Rodrigues's letters. The Australians seem uninterested in gifts. He says they're the most incorrupt and upright rulers he's ever seen."

"Oh, you can't give high-value gifts—they won't appreciate those. Would they appreciate a Venetian carved cup or something? Where has your wit gone? Paintings, sculptures, perhaps they have architectural needs..." Father Comanach slowly raised his eyelids to look at him.

"Yes, I understand."

"Additionally, the Australian church differs greatly from ours. Believers don't observe Lent."

"God!"

"According to Prior Wu, the Australian church has been this way from ancient times." Father Comanach said. "This matter is not unforgivable. I believe the Holy See will issue a special dispensation for this."

Father Jin Lige, filled with amazement, anticipation, and various fantasies, returned to his humble lodgings to pack his belongings. A priest had few belongings—just a few changes of clothes. Most important were his art supplies. Brushes, pigments, oils, and various small items for painting—many couldn't be bought locally; even in Europe, some could only be found in Italy. He had brought many when he first came to the Far East.

The Father had a probationary brother as his attendant, named John Dermott, from the "Island of Saints"—Ireland. This probationary brother had a head of wild red hair and was pale and thin. He was not only training to become a brother but also studying painting under the Father. The Father was very fond of this young, diligent brother and often taught him many painting techniques.

Brother Dermott was in his room painting a holy icon. Jin Lige watched him carefully as he applied bright blue to the panel—a special blue available only in Venice. Such liberal application on an indifferent painting pained him slightly. Dermott's technique was good, but his images appeared very stiff. Jin Lige knew his student's artistic talent was quite limited. But he was very fervent—in both faith and painting.

"Is your painting nearly finished?"

"It will be done soon."
