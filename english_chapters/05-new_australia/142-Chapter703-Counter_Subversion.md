# Chapter 703 - Counter-Subversion

"Employed?" Wang You smiled bitterly. "Just scraping by, avoiding destitution." He shook his head as if venting frustration. "I'm serving as advisor to Zheng Bao."

"Zheng Bao? Is he a relative of Zheng Zhilong?"

"He wishes he could claim such a connection, but he has absolutely nothing to do with Zheng Zhilong. He's a local from the Dianbai area. Only rose up about a year ago. But he's gathered quite a few men and ships. Those ships at Lantau are all his."

"Quite a scale."

"His core men and ships aren't many—it just looks impressive on the surface." Wang You sighed. "You know how it is with these big gangs of ours. When things are prospering, who knows how many people eat from the same pot? The moment things go a bit sideways, everyone scatters."

"Ha ha!" Shi Fourteen patted his belly and laughed. "Steward Wang, now you're overgeneralizing! Some things—you can't blame others; you have to blame yourself first!"

"What do you mean?" Wang You had always believed that Zhu Cailao's downfall was largely due to his subordinates abandoning ship at the first sign of trouble. If the inner and outer stock-holders had stood together during that crisis, how could things have deteriorated to total annihilation at Nanri Island?

"Boss Zhu certainly had nothing to reproach himself for when it came to treating his brothers," said Shi Fourteen, squinting. "I, Shi Fourteen, can also say I did right by the Boss—charging at the front through fire and water. Even when fleeing, I was nearly the last one out. But what about those who were always at the Boss's side? Where did they all run off to?"

He took a sip of tea. "Back in the prosperous days, how many relatives of relatives held power and controlled everything in the old camp? Just getting a bit of rice or some gunpowder and shells meant bowing and scraping everywhere, offering gifts. Otherwise, they'd make difficulties and refuse to issue anything! These things, Steward Wang, you know better than I do. All those years of prosperity—these people shipped gold, silver treasures, and women back home boatload after boatload. Even distant relatives had houses and land set up for them—whole families living in splendor. But what about us outsiders?" Shi Fourteen seemed to be venting his long-held grievances. "Fighting at the front, yet aside from what we could grab for ourselves, all the benefits went to those in the inner cabinet. So of course when disaster struck, everyone scattered. Don't you think?"

Wang You was speechless. Everything Shi Fourteen said was true. But this was how things worked everywhere in the world; he had never thought there was anything improper about it.

"Isn't it the same everywhere under heaven?" Wang You said. "The Emperor himself has but one head—why should his descendants for generations all be imperial relatives?" He seized the opportunity: "Being with the Australians now—isn't it about the same?"

"That's completely different." Shi Fourteen shook his head. "Working for the Australians—first, rewards and punishments are clear, and they keep their word. Second, the more capable you are at doing things, the higher you rise. No ambiguity whatsoever."

"Really?"

Shi Fourteen nodded: "Absolutely!"

"Remarkable." Wang You chatted with him a while longer. He had already given up hope of convincing Shi Fourteen. He could see that Shi Fourteen's spirit and demeanor were completely different from before. The Australians seemed to have transformed him. Not only was his manner of speaking different, but even his gestures and movements had changed. His speech was full of new terms that left Wang You struggling to keep up.

Shi Fourteen suddenly smiled: "Steward Wang, you've come here probably to persuade me to join Zheng Bao."

Wang You nodded: "Indeed I have." He shook his head. "But now there's no point in saying more." He continued, "Just looking at this ship of yours, I know you absolutely won't join him."

"Steward Wang is perceptive," said Shi Fourteen. "That worthless Zheng somebody is merely a petty pirate gang. I'm now a proper Australasian Song naval officer. How could I sell my service fighting for him and continue being a sea bandit?"

Wang You could only nod at this point.

"I don't think you need to go back either. What kind of future could you have with a small outfit like Zheng Bao's?" Seeing Wang You's dejected expression and the incompatibility with Zheng Bao he'd displayed from the start, Shi Fourteen knew this former steward probably wasn't getting along well with his current boss. Though he and Wang You couldn't claim a deep friendship, the former steward had been a decent enough person in the past. Shi Fourteen felt he should try to help.

Wang You smiled ruefully: "You want me to join the Australians?"

"Why not?" said Shi Fourteen. "Look at me—after joining the Australians, haven't I been living well? Much more satisfying than before."

Wang You shook his head unconsciously. It wasn't that he felt the matter couldn't be considered, but rather that he found it somewhat embarrassing. Having failed to convince the other party as an envoy was bad enough, but to be counter-persuaded himself? He felt he couldn't save face.

He pondered for a moment: As for Zheng Bao's side, he truly didn't want to continue following him—it was obvious he would have no future there. The Australians had inflicted a crushing defeat on the government troops, occupied Qiongzhou, and their momentum was surging... He suddenly realized the other party hadn't even offered terms for his surrender yet.

As if guessing what Wang You was thinking, Shi Fourteen added: "The Australians never make empty promises of titles, everything depends on your ability. Right now, they need people. As long as you work sincerely and diligently, why worry about having no future? With your qualifications as the former manager of Boss's old camp, getting a position as a staff officer in the logistics department would be a sure thing."

Wang You didn't know what these ranks meant. But with his experience, he knew they weren't the various empty titles and sinecures that the Lê dynasty granted—the ones Zheng Bao was so proud of. These had to be actual positions in the Australian military. Though they sounded less impressive, they were far more valuable than titles like "Ninghai General" from the Great Lê Dynasty. When Zheng Zhilong submitted to the court, he only received the rank of *youji*. How many people were already envious of that? Wang You had read a few books and knew that handing out titles and positions wantonly was absolutely not something a proper regime should do. The Australians controlled their titles and positions very tightly, which he thought spoke well of them.

"Brother Shi," Wang You decided to ask one final question, "in your view, what are the Australians' intentions in coming to our Central Kingdom?"

---

"They've already raised the banner of Australasian Song—what do you think their intentions are?"

Wang You's heart leapt: "Could it be they seek to claim the Nine Tripods?"

"What?" Shi Fourteen's education was limited; he didn't know this literary allusion.

"I mean, they want to rebel, to change dynasties..." Despite having spent most of his life as a pirate, killing officials and breaking into cities more than once or twice, Wang You still lowered his voice when speaking of "rebellion."

"That's exactly what it is!" said Shi Fourteen. "They wouldn't stay in their prosperous Australia and come to this barren land of Lingao—why? If not to rebel and become emperors, why endure such hardship?"

In the end, Wang You's arduous journey to convince Shi Fourteen to defect ultimately resulted in his own defection. Shi Fourteen arranged for Wang You and his men to be sent ashore. Before Chen Haiyang, Wang You unhesitatingly betrayed Zheng Bao's entire gang—their schemes, their strength, and the specific internal situation of the pirate band.

Not only that, he volunteered to return and subvert some of Zhu Cailao's former subordinates.

Chen Haiyang praised him and expressed willingness to accept all "those who turn toward the light." He also indicated that if they couldn't pull men and ships out beforehand, as long as they raised white flags and followed navigation orders during the battle, those ships wouldn't be attacked. The two sides also agreed on other signal flags for communication.

If Wang You really could subvert them, obtaining some ships and sailors for free would certainly be excellent. If he failed, it wouldn't affect the overall situation. Chen Haiyang had already set his plan: regardless of whether Wang You's subversion succeeded, he would launch the general assault on Lantau on schedule three days hence—September 10th by the Western calendar.

Chen Sigen released his grip, and the lifeless body slumped into the grass. He noticed that no blood remained on the blade—it dripped cleanly from the tip onto the ground. He flicked the blade and slid it back into its sheath.

"Truly a fine blade." Chen Sigen praised it briefly. The corpse lay at his feet, blood flowing from beneath its throat. Those who had never witnessed death would find it hard to believe how much blood the human body contained.

This man wore patched coarse cloth clothing, his hair tied in a careless topknot. He was barefoot—looking just like the immigrants who landed at Bopu every day. The only difference was that he carried a large saber and a spear.

Around him, four or five similar bodies lay strewn about, each with throat cut, blood pouring out. Some still twitched convulsively. The Special Recon Team members all wore excited expressions. Taking out seven men at the outpost simultaneously, all brought down within thirty seconds—that was an exceptional result.

The only one still alive was pressed firmly to the ground, his mouth stuffed with dirt.

"Let him up, or he'll suffocate." Chen Sigen sat down on a rock. The pirates had built a small shelter here to serve as an observation post watching the sea.

The recon team members dragged the prisoner before him. His arms hung limp—his joints had been dislocated in that split-second. Combined with the dirt smeared all over his face, his pained grimace made him look barely human.

Chen Sigen briefly interrogated the prisoner—he learned they had only been posted to the ridge the day before. Because the advisor's negotiations with the Australians had been unsuccessful, and both sides were apparently about to fight, the Boss had sent people to the ridges to keep watch, alert for any sudden Australian attack.

"How many groups were sent out, and where?"

"I only saw four groups—I didn't see the others, so I don't dare say."

"Where were they all sent?"

"Also to Liujiao Mountain, Phoenix Mountain, and Tai O Island."

The group heading for Phoenix Mountain had already been eliminated by the Special Recon Team's observation post stationed there earlier. This confirmed the prisoner wasn't lying. But there was no way to be certain there weren't other pirate posts.

"How do you signal when you spot the enemy?"

"Three fires at night, black smoke during the day." The prisoner howled in pain. "I wouldn't dare lie."

"Reset his joints and take him down the mountain. If he's not cooperative, kill him." Chen Sigen gave the order. Then he looked around the post. The location had been chosen well—vessels passing through the Ma Wan Channel were almost entirely visible.
