# Chapter 648 A Battle at Shishan

Because ten men were tied together in a team and a slight carelessness would cause them all to fall to the ground, the porridge was distributed into people's hands. The bowl Jiang Yougong received felt very light in hand; a careful look revealed it was a coconut shell. The cook poured a ladle of ginger soup into everyone's bowl.

This was obviously distributed for fear of them getting sick. Jiang Yougong knew the Hair Bandits absolutely didn't want them dead, so he drank the soup boldly and was about to lie down to sleep.

"Squad Leader Sir!" A soldier tied with him asked in a low voice, "Why did the Hair Bandits strip off our clothes?"

"They can't possibly want you to be a rabbit (gigolo)!" Jiang Yougong said. He also felt it was suspicious; he had never heard of stripping clothes naked when becoming a captive—what did the Hair Bandits want those few tattered uniform coats for? Besides, those uniforms were all thrown under the earthen dike and weren't picked up.

According to the statistics of Jia Mofei, who was in charge of logistics and transport, this unsuccessful sneak attack provided more than three hundred healthy captives.

"Load them onto ships and transport them back to Lingao as soon as the rain stops tomorrow." Jia Mofei said, "Traveling by land might encounter government roving cavalry interception. Since there are ships anyway, transporting people is fast and convenient."

"Loaded together with the wounded?"

"Of course not. There are separate ships for the wounded. Captive ship conditions are much worse; just a big hold under the deck, easier once the grid hatch cover is closed. It's only half a day anyway."

The disastrous defeat of the entire night raid happened almost under the eyelids of He Rubin and others. The swaying light beams, volley fire, and huge human voices on the earthen dike caused this General great unease. The fact that Hair Bandit firearms could fire in rain no longer shocked him. The suddenly lit snow-bright light and the white light beams prowling in the pitch-black sky and wild fields of the rainy night far exceeded his cognitive level. He Rubin's hands and feet were ice-cold: *How to fight this battle?*

Ye Zhengfang and Yan Zungao, who fled back, added many details, including that the enemy was obviously prepared, and the enemy's lights were extremely bright, instantly making officers and soldiers dizzy and unable to even open their eyes...

The entire gate tower fell into a long silence. Everyone was pondering: *How can this battle still be fought?* Everyone expected others to come up with a solution.

"Your Excellency! The student thinks we should set up a stockade to defend firmly!" Qian Taichong had been unable to find an opportunity to offer advice, and now finally had a chance to speak. He watched the battle on the city wall several times today. The battle stimulated him greatly. The Hair Bandits' "sharp firearms" and tactics left an extremely deep impression on him.

Obviously, the Hair Bandits were not like Zheng Zhilong, Liu Xiang, and their ilk, who were only good at naval battles; they were absolutely not inferior in infantry combat either. He realized that the number of Hair Bandit infantry committed to battle today was not large, but facing so many government soldiers, they fought so tenaciously on the stockade wall, fighting to the death without retreating. Obviously, they didn't rely solely on the four words "sharp firearms."

*Could it be that such overseas bandits also have hearts of loyalty and righteousness?* He immediately denied his own view. According to the Tangbao (Capital Report), most Hair Bandits were "treacherous people of Fujian and Guangdong" and "traitors" who defected to become Fake Hairs. *Do such people without father or monarch also have loyalty and righteousness? It must be the True Hairs promising heavy profits that made them disregard life and death like this.*

Thinking of this, he felt slightly relieved. In Qian Taichong's view, the word "loyalty and righteousness" had nothing to do with barbarians. After the battle ended, he knew his "Six Strategies for Aftermath" wouldn't be of use for a while—the certainty of winning by continuing the attack tomorrow was minimal. He had long calculated in his heart, and when he heard He Rubin didn't want to set up a stockade to defend firmly, he felt it necessary to come out and offer advice.

According to his statement: both sides setting up stockades to confront each other was beneficial to the government army. After all, He Rubin had the support of the whole province behind him, while the Hair Bandits possessed only one county, and Lingao was a place with few people and barren land. The Hair Bandits concentrated an army of ten thousand in Chengmai, requiring much manpower to transport grain and fodder. Once time dragged on, supply would inevitably be difficult. After a stalemate of several months, when Hair Bandit grain and fodder gradually became unsustainable, they would inevitably fall into chaos without fighting.

"...No matter how strong the Hair Bandit artillery fire is, there are no more than twenty-plus pieces. They can't possibly bombard our stockade constantly. Our soldiers are numerous; we can promise heavy gold to recruit death-sworn soldiers to raid the Hair Bandit grain route. Over time, the Hair Bandits will surely fall into chaos without fighting!"

This plan was actually still the old strategy of advancing troops with prudence. He Rubin originally just listened to this young scholar's proposal tentatively, but now hope suddenly ignited: *Right! However, besieging to force enemy retreat was originally the Viceroy's plan. It's just that the original plan was to besiege the enemy camp at Bopu, finally forcing them to withdraw. Now the place is changed to Chengmai—*

*But to confront the Hair Bandits here for a long time, the safety of grain transport must be guaranteed. Once the army lacks grain, morale will waver, and the collapse of the hundred-thousand-strong army will be a matter of moments.*

He held a meeting with generals, asking everyone to dig trenches to defend firmly, preparing for a long-term stalemate with the Hair Bandits. Shishan was an important intermediate grain depot between Qiongshan and Chengmai. He Rubin ordered Yan Zungao to take two thousand men and horses to protect the grain depot and grain transport along the route, sent private secretaries to Qiongshan to manage grain and fodder transport, and wrote a letter to Wang Zunde reporting that the government army had lifted the siege of Chengmai and killed/captured many Hair Bandits, but the Hair Bandits formed a stockade relying on firearms to defend to the death. The government army failed repeatedly in attacks and was building a long siege to trap the Hair Bandit whole army in Chengmai, hoping to transfer a dozen more Red Barbarian Cannons. As for provisions and funds, transport must also be grasped tightly.

Early the next morning, the government army didn't launch a full-scale offensive as expected, but dispatched the whole army to dig trenches and set up stockades under Chengmai city, reinforcing fortifications.

He Ming saw the government soldiers busy reinforcing fortifications and knew the enemy had lost their sharpness, daring not come out to fight again, preparing to fight a long-term stalemate war with them. This was certainly a good thing, but the enemy's twenty thousand men and horses were huddled together. His own total strength was less than half of the opponent's; it would probably be difficult to form an effective encirclement.

"Our army cannot fight a long-term stalemate war with the enemy in Chengmai. THe result of fighting a stalemate war is us suffering losses." In the combat meeting, Dongmen Chuiyu said, "Attributes to the enemy having the financial and material support of the whole Guangdong Province despite backward logistical means. As long as Wang Zunde is willing, he can confront us for as long as he wants. This is disastrous for our finances."

"Originally hoped He Rubin would attack again today, crippling his main force, then taking the opportunity to rout his whole army. It seems there's no hope." He Ming shook his head and said, "Now we have to fight a siege warfare."

The side with fewer people besieging the side with more people was certainly not rare in war history, but the Fubo Army's strength was too small after all. He Ming was very worried about this.

At this time, the Special Reconnaissance Team sent a report, reporting that about two thousand men and horses had left the Grand Camp, moving towards Qiongshan direction.

"Is the enemy starting to retreat?"

"No, He Rubin absolutely dares not retreat just like this." He Ming judged, "His rushing to repair fortifications like this is to confront us for a long time. This group of men and horses is very likely used to protect the grain station."

"It's also possible the enemy is repairing a plank road openly (feint)." Someone reminded.

"That possibility exists. But since the enemy wants to protect the grain route, we will cut off the grain route." He Ming looked at the map and made up his mind. "Get me Infantry 1st and 4th Battalions!"

Just past noon, He Rubin and others were planning the layout of the defense system. Suddenly a scout reported: saying thousands of Hair Bandits had cut off the main road between Chengmai and Shishan. Yan Zungao's unit was routed and was currently fleeing towards Chengmai direction!

"Where is General Yan?"

"Life or death unknown!" The scout said tremblingly, "General Yan's big flag was not seen among the routed soldiers."

"Scout again!" He Rubin turned pale for a moment. The Hair Bandits cut off the rear road unexpectedly. He immediately ordered the Central Army Garrison Guerrilla Sun Changzuo to take five hundred men and horses with his warrant to collect routed soldiers along the way. Subsequently, he ordered people to invite Zhao Ruyi and main generals to meet and discuss.

"With Regional Commander Yan defeated, our army is in imminent danger," He Rubin said in a deep voice, "Once the enemy army breaks General Yan's unit, they will turn around to attack Shishan and seize my grain depot!"

The Hair Bandits defeated Yan Zungao's subordinates in one fell swoop; the next step must be to raid and occupy Shishan. Shishan was only defended by five hundred soldiers. Since the enemy could crush a crowd of two thousand, taking down Shishan would not be difficult. Once Shishan was lost, the grain route would be cut. Once the grain route was cut, the whole army's collapse would be right before their eyes!

This terrible prospect made everyone present feel cold all over.

He Rubin immediately arranged the defense of each camp, ordering each army to guard their camps strictly, forbidding noise and running around, even less allowing unauthorized withdrawal from defense areas.

"Generals, we are now in an unpredictable place!" He Rubin said sternly, "Our camp is pitched steadily; the overall situation has not reached an irreversible time. The Hair Bandits just rely on superior equipment to snatch the initiative! Hair Bandits have few soldiers and little food. Our army only needs to retake Shishan and protect the grain route to turn defeat into victory!"

Immediately he ordered Governor's Standard Camp Guerrilla Sha Jianbi stationed at Xiaoyingchang to immediately lead the whole army to withdraw from Xiaoyingchang.

"You take your headquarters' men and horses to Shishan immediately, rout the Hair Bandits, and ensure Shishan's safety." He Rubin said, "If the enemy army takes Shishan, you must also retake that place."

"Humble General understands!" Sha Jianbi knew the weight of this.

"I give you another two thousand men and horses."

Sha Jianbi had just led men and horses out. Bad news came quickly: Shishan had fallen! After the Hair Bandits defeated Yan Zungao's unit, they immediately turned back to capture Shishan, seizing all military grain stored in Shishan.

"Three thousand Hair Bandits have lined up at Shishan!" The scout reported again, "And have big cannons!"

"Big cannons?!"

"Yes, according to routed soldiers, Hair Bandits brought several big cannons with extremely great power. General Yan didn't know they had big cannons, caught off guard, and was killed by cannon fire!"

He Rubin had no heart to listen further. This series of bad news almost plunged him into despair. But he tried hard to remain calm, continuing to deploy military strength to guard against Hair Bandits besieging his Grand Camp amidst chaos. Because he heard the enemy had big cannons, he ordered Li Guang to take two thousand men quickly to reinforce Sha Jianbi subsequently.

Sha Jianbi led three thousand men to open the camp gate, hurriedly going towards Shishan along the post road. Such a big movement naturally couldn't be hidden from observation posts and Special Reconnaissance Team members. A few minutes later, the Infantry 1st and 4th Battalions constructing positions near Shishan received this news.

Zhu Mingxia and 1st Infantry Battalion Commander Xiong Maozhang were cleaning the battlefield and building fortifications. These 2 infantry battalions arrived at Shishan at forced march speed immediately upon receiving orders early in the morning. Xiong Maozhang's 1st Battalion captured the Ming army camp at Shishan with shelling from 3 brought 12-pounder mountain howitzers plus one determined bayonet charge, capturing more than three hundred prisoners, seizing seventy or eighty thousand *jin* of grain accumulated at the grain depot and hundreds of wheelbarrows for transporting grain. Subsequently, the 1st Infantry Battalion lined up at the foot of Shishan.

The two thousand men and horses led by Yan Zungao marched urgently all the way, constantly suffering harassment and sniping from the Special Reconnaissance Team. Multiple generals lost their lives. Hearts were in great turmoil. Fortunately, soldiers knew this was going toward the safe Qiongshan direction; everyone harbored the thought that they would have more chance to survive if they could reach Shishan, so they hurried desperately. Because Yan Zungao wanted to reach Shishan before the Hair Bandits completed defenses, he urged the troops to force march all the way; many infantrymen fell behind. Finally, he only arrived at Shishan with one thousand two hundred men.

Red flags fluttered. A gray battle line was already waiting in strict order at the foot of Shishan. Yan Zungao saw the enemy hadn't constructed a camp yet, only a trench covering the whole army, and troops were only about one thousand. But he had no troop strength advantage himself. He had witnessed the Hair Bandits' firearms advantage yesterday; winning an immediate battle had minimal odds.

Therefore, he retreated to a small hill opposite Shishan, preparing to set up camp and wait for the arrival of follow-up troops before making plans.

But the Fubo Army had no time to give him this chance. At 11 AM, with the accompanying support of 2 12-pounder mountain howitzers, Zhu Mingxia commanded the 4th Infantry Battalion to suddenly charge out from Shishan's flank in company columns, launching a fierce attack on Yan Zungao's unit.

Yan Zungao was caught off guard—under the constant harassment and screening of the Special Reconnaissance Team, he basically couldn't grasp the enemy movements nearby. At this moment, men were tired and horses exhausted, officers and soldiers' morale low. Suddenly a fresh force attacked from the flank. He hurriedly ordered a Chiliarch to take three hundred men to meet the attack, aiming to delay the enemy's momentum temporarily to win time to line up.

These three hundred men routed upon contact under the 4th Battalion's fierce attack. Yan Zungao had to lead the main force personally to meet the battle. His men and horses couldn't withstand the Fubo Army's firepower and were forced to retreat. Ye Zhengfang took personal soldiers and house guards to supervise the battle everywhere, barely maintaining the order of men and horses, but all forces were still forced to retreat towards the foot of Shishan.

The 4th Battalion was like a hammer, and the 1st Battalion lined up in a transverse column at the foot of the hill was the anvil. These more than one thousand hungry and exhausted soldiers couldn't withstand such a pincer attack from front and rear at all. The whole army was crushed to powder at the foot of Shishan. The remaining seven or eight hundred people all became captives. Only those soldiers who fell behind escaped by luck.

Xiong Maozhang sat on the low wall constructed at the foot of Shishan smoking a pipe. His soldiers stripped to the waist, digging trenches—trenches needed to be further deepened and widened to effectively contain enemy charges. In the distance, the ground was piled with swords, spears, weapons, armor, and flags seized from cleaning the battlefield. Naked captives tied in strings were being escorted towards the original Ming army camp on the mountain. That was now the temporary headquarters of the 2 battalions.

Zhu Mingxia galloped back and forth riding a captured jujube-red Mongolian horse. This was a general's mount, very spirited. Zhu Mingxia had dark skin and very short hair, looking very capable. Hanging at his waist was not the standard Fubo Army Army Officer Command Saber, but a folded pattern steel Tang Sword he customized in the old dimension himself, decorated very beautifully.

"This horse is not bad." He rode the horse to the low wall and dismounted, "Just the tack is no good; I'm not used to the old-style saddle."

"We are infantry officers," Xiong Maozhang blew out smoke rings one by one, "Why don't you be a Dragoon?"

"I'd like to be, but need to have horses, no?" Zhu Mingxia patted the horse regretfully, letting a surrendered government soldier groom lead the horse away to send to the stockade on the mountain.

"Radio said government troops sent another five thousand men over, three thousand in front, two thousand behind supporting. We have a total of one thousand eight hundred; just now we had a hundred casualties."

"Not a big problem." Zhu Mingxia opened his map case, spreading the map, "The enemy got anxious and used the most taboo fueling tactic (sending troops piecemeal). We'll continue to fight him waiting at ease for the fatigued enemy. Three thousand against one thousand eight hundred, we still have odds of winning."

Generally speaking, the tactics remained unchanged. The 1st Infantry Battalion would defend relying on simple field fortifications, attracting government soldiers to attack the front fiercely. After the battle entered a stalemate, the 4th Infantry Battalion would kill out from the flank and rear, directly sweeping their flank, inflicting heavy damage and routing them. As long as the Special Reconnaissance Team conducted strong screening against the government army, it would be difficult for government soldiers to discover such simple tactical coordination. They could only rush fiercely towards the 1st Battalion's pre-set positions like a blind man riding a blind horse and then smash their heads bloody.

"We just need to stop them from going to Qiongshan; no need to annihilate all. Captives don't need to be grabbed in a hurry either—can't handle too many. The government army Grand Camp is still there; letting defeated soldiers flee to Chengmai and letting He Rubin send people to take them in is fine. Crippled units are birds startled by a bowstring, useless anyway, and will drag down his whole army's morale instead."

"Let's do just that!" Xiong Maozhang nodded, "How much ammo do you have left now? I'm running low; each infantryman only has one hundred rounds."

"I'll spare you twenty rounds per person. I'm an assault force; fifty rounds per person is enough for me. When the time comes, it's straight to bayonets drawing red!" Zhu Mingxia said and wrote a note, instructing the orderly: "Go, give to the Battalion Quartermaster, let him send twenty thousand rounds over immediately."

"Pity cannonballs aren't enough; we still have too few people."

The 4 12-pounder mountain howitzers that played a decisive role in the battle were light to carry and could be easily dragged by a few people, but the weight of shells and gunpowder was not less at all. More than half was consumed in the battle just now.

"It's fine, still have grenades." Zhu Mingxia was very confident. In his view, having cannons just meant the battle would be smoother and casualties smaller, but the outcome of the battle had no suspense.

"Two Battalion Commanders! Ming army general's corpse found." A corporal came hurriedly to report.

"Oh? Go see!" Zhu Mingxia instantly got spirited. The two walked towards the Medical Corps cleaning the battlefield together.

A corpse wearing armor lay on a stretcher, looking about thirty or forty years old. The armor on the body was very exquisite, should be a type of scale armor, unlike the rough iron armor simply linked by iron pieces worn by infantry. He and Xiong Maozhang knew very little about armor, but from the armor's patterns, decorations, and brocade used for edging, they knew this armor was definitely not what ordinary officers could wear; must be a great general.

Immediately they found a few people from surrendered soldiers and generals to identify. Soon it was recognized that this was Huezhou Regional Commander Yan Zungao who came to reinforce the grain depot.
