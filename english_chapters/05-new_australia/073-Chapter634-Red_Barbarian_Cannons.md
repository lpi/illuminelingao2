# Chapter 634 - Red Barbarian Cannons

Everyone was still talking when suddenly a personal guard reported that the cannon consecration ceremony was ready. To deal with the Hair Thieves' fierce firearms, Foshan had newly sent ten freshly cast "Red Barbarian Cannons" (Hongyi Cannons). He Rubin had ordered someone to choose an auspicious day to personally consecrate and test-fire the cannons.

Today happened to be an auspicious day. He Rubin led his staff to the drill ground. His main generals were all present, and Lu Yizhong had also come, looking around. Ten glistening bronze cannons were mounted on newly made, sturdy elm carriages with two wheels and two legs, appearing very robust. An altar table was set up in front of the cannons, with a red paper spirit tablet inscribed "Spirit Position of the Great General Cannon." Before the tablet were offerings of three livestock, clear wine, incense burners, candlesticks, and other items.

He Rubin, accompanied by Li Modao, the commander of the Firearms Battalion with the rank of Defender, washed his hands and burned incense, bowing devoutly three times to the Cannon God. He also recited a prayer drafted beforehand by his staff, then poured a full cup of wine onto the ground. Ten gunners first knelt and bowed to the Commander-in-Chief and others, then walked to the cannons, knelt and kowtowed three times again, before proceeding to maneuver the cannons.

Next was the cannon demonstration—the so-called "Auspicious Cannon Firing." Newly cast cannons were routinely test-fired, a common practice in weapon manufacturing. However, once cannons came into use, traditional weapons like siege engines and trebuchets used in China immediately paled in comparison. Cannons inevitably acquired a mystical color, leading to various rituals. Since the Yuan Dynasty, cannons had titles and sacrificial rites.

He Rubin placed great importance on the cannon consecration. On one hand, he believed it helped boost morale; on the other, he wanted to know the power of these provincially manufactured Red Barbarian Cannons. He was among the early adopters of Red Barbarian Cannons; when they were first introduced during the Tianqi era, he had watched test firings, learned Western gunnery, and even obtained a book on firearms.

At that time, the technology for imitating Red Barbarian Cannons was quite mature. The cannons produced in Li Luoyou's foundry used cannons borrowed from Macau as models, and he had a German missionary, Johann Adam Schall von Bell, hidden in his home for constant guidance. After returning from Lingao, Li Luoyou built some improvised equipment based on what he saw and heard at the Lingao Gun Foundry and guidance from Europeans around him, applying the technique of boring the barrel smooth with a boring cutter. Therefore, the Red Barbarian Cannons he cast were visibly superior to those from other foundries.

"These cannons are well cast," he praised. He had already seen that this batch consisted of lighter Red Barbarian Cannons. "Who cast these?"

"Answring Your Excellency: They were cast by the Li family foundry in Foshan," Li Modao reported. "Their foundry is different from others; their cannons are specifically excellent."

He Rubin thought for a moment and asked: "Is that Li Luoyou?"

"Exactly. I heard he was very eager in casting cannons, specifically asking the Governor to issue a letter to borrow cannons from the Franks for imitation."

"No wonder his cannons are well made; Manager Li is half a foreign barbarian," He Rubin laughed. "I heard he served as an altar boy for Frankish foreign monks in Macau when young, and was very intimate with them. His sentiment with Franks is indeed different!"

Everyone laughed heartily. Everyone knew He Rubin strongly disliked foreign religions and naturally detested people who were Christians and had deep ties with the Macau church.

"Please instruct, Commander," Li Modao clasped his hands. "Shall we fire the cannons immediately?" Receiving He Rubin's consent, Li Modao waved the command flag in his hand:

"By the Commander's order, test fire immediately!"

With a command, ten gunners immediately ran over and pushed out one of the cannons. Red Barbarian Cannons were very heavy; even this light artillery firing 5-catty balls weighed 1,500 catties. To bear the weight and ensure durability, the carriages were made of particularly thick and heavy materials, with many iron nails and hoops on the wheels. The whole artillery piece was very cumbersome, and ten gunners struggled to move it.

The gunners pushed the cannon into position. One of them first used a gunner's quadrant to measure the angle. Red Barbarian Cannons were actually culverins/cannons, generally fired at lower angles for maximum range.

The gunner reported loudly: "Quadrant height six fen!" Then another gunner used a hammer to strike the wooden wedge inserted between the barrel and the carriage, gradually raising the barrel.

Quadrant height of six fen roughly corresponded to a 45-degree angle, the elevation for maximum range of a smoothbore cannon.

"Barrel height six fen, the shot can reach one thousand and fifty-three paces," He Rubin told the staff and generals. "If seven fen, the shot falls shorter." He had compiled *Western Fire Attack Divine Devices* himself and knew this stuff backward.

Li Modao said respectfully: "Your Excellency's insight is extremely correct."

Once the barrel was elevated to position, the gunner shouted again: "Use two catties six taels of powder!"

Two other gunners quickly brought a porcelain jar from a pit. This jar was specifically for holding gunpowder, glazed inside and out, with a constricted neck for tying and a rattan or bamboo casing for carrying. The gunner opened the sealing clay, removed the porcelain saucer sealing the mouth, measured gunpowder scoop by scoop with a wooden ladle, and poured it into the barrel. One gunner used a long rammer to push the powder to the bottom of the bore, inserted a fuse made of paper and powder into the vent near the breech, continued loading powder, rammed it tight, inserted a wooden wad, and finally loaded the iron ball.

Li Modao asked everyone to retreat ten zhang away. Other officers and soldiers also retreated to a distance, prepared for accidents. Li Modao only retreated one zhang, waved the small flag in his hand, and said:

"Fire!"

A gunner lit the fuse with a torch. The gunners immediately retreated to Li Modao's side, looking tense, all watching the fuse hissing and sparking as it shortened rapidly.

Although cannons were powerful, cannon casting lacked process management at the time. Materials varied in quality, and quality couldn't be guaranteed; inexperienced gunners learned from translated Western gunnery books that ignored unit conversions... This caused many cannons to explode on the first firing, often killing or wounding many.

The fuse burned into the vent with hissing sparks. Suddenly, red light flashed at the vent, followed by fire spraying from the muzzle and a loud bang. Everyone felt the ground shake, and thick smoke instantly covered the front of the cannon. When the cannon fired, staff and officers instinctively hunched over, and gunners squatted down sharply.

Li Modao bent his waist; seeing the red light, he quickly opened his mouth. After the bang, he ran to the cannon rapidly, inspected it, touched it with his hand, felt relieved, and hurried back to report:
"Your Excellency! The cannon is intact."

He Rubin, staff, and officers approached. They inspected the barrel and carriage; solid as before. Very satisfied. After a while, a personal guard rode back fast from a mound two li away to report: The cannonball flew over the mound and broke a tree behind it.

"The Hair Thieves claim fierce firearms; how do they compare to this cannon?" He Rubin laughed.

"However fierce Hair Thief cannons are, they are but this," Chang Qingyun said.

"Hehe, this is only a small cannon with a 5-catty ball. If it were a big cannon firing a 15-catty ball, one shot could devastate three or four li. The Hair Thieves' firearms, however sharp, are at most like this." He Rubin was confident. "Defender Li, how many big cannons does the Firearms Battalion have now?"

"Reporting to Your Excellency: Including these ten Red Barbarian Cannons, new and old cannons total one hundred sixty-four pieces."

"Crouching Tiger cannons and the like don't count. Excluding these small guns, how many?"

"Reporting to Your Excellency: Thirty-eight pieces."

"Good!" He Rubin was quite satisfied. "Here are actual samples of newly cast Western cannonballs sent by the Ministry of Works. Test fire them one by one. If useful, order the foundry to rush production immediately."

"Yes, Your Excellency."

This batch of new-style cannonballs was cast under Johann Adam Schall von Bell's supervision, distributed to Liaodong, the Capital Region, Shandong, Fujian, Guangdong, and other places equipping Red Barbarian Cannons for testing.

These cannonballs had various names: Dragon Roar Shot, Chain Shot, Drill Shot, Chisel Shot, etc. Numerous and strange-looking. Li Modao loaded and tested them one by one, but everyone couldn't see any specific function for the strange balls sent, and ranges were much shorter. Only the huge whistling sound of the Dragon Roar Shot made everyone think it had certain deterrent effects.

As for the chain shot that split into two connected by a chain after firing; bar shot with a fixed iron bar between two hemispheres; expanding shot with four hemispheres connected by chains to a central iron knob—they looked powerful, but ranges were much closer. Staff officers felt it better to fire solid balls and grapeshot directly.

"Defender Li, what do you think of these cannonballs?" He Rubin asked.

"Your Excellency, the Dragon Roar Shot sounds like a dragon roar, useful for deterring enemy courage. But it is not the orthodox way. As for the others..." Li Modao felt these weird-shaped balls were useless. "This humble officer thinks they can be used, but they waste labor and material, and don't shoot far."

"Foreign monks just know how to fiddle with weird gadgets to cheat people." He Rubin laughed. "We won't use this mess."

He Rubin then inspected the Firearms Battalion. This battalion was specially set up to deal with Hair Thieves, gathering many cannons and building many new carriages. Seeing the Firearms Battalion's orderly ranks, excellent armor and weapons, and soldiers busy drilling or maintaining equipment without idlers, He Rubin felt very satisfied.

"Defender Li!"

"Your Excellency!" Li Modao hurriedly stepped up.

"You lead troops well!"

"All thanks to Your Excellency's tiger prestige!"

"Mm." He Rubin nodded. "I hear you are skilled with firearms. Hair Thieves have a name for sharp firearms; what do you think?"

"Reporting to Your Excellency," Li Modao said cautiously. "This humble officer has never seen Hair Thief firearms, only heard they have giant cannons reaching over ten li. In this humble officer's opinion, such rumors are mostly exaggerated."

"How so?"

"This humble officer has been in the army sixteen years. Started as a three-barreled gunner, handled countless firearms large and small. Ranges of firearms are mostly exaggerated. From what I've seen using cannons over the years, the medium Frankish breech-loader shoots no more than two hundred paces; the Crouching Tiger cannon, no more than thirty or forty paces. Yet books claim they reach several li, tens of li. Even Red Barbarian Cannons, though distinguished as 1,000, 2,000, or 5,000 catties, actually shoot furthest no more than three li. Giant cannons don't necessarily shoot far."

He Rubin appreciated these words, thinking only someone with combat experience could say them. He sized up this thirty-something officer. Square face, tall and sturdy build, powerful. Clearly a talent good at battlefield slaughter.

"Ever slaughtered in battle?"

"Reporting to Your Excellency, this humble officer once followed Garrison Commander Zhou of the Zhejiang Battalion in the Sarhu Campaign. After the East Route Army was defeated, I led brothers to defend a high ridge to the death, resisting enemies with firearms until dusk when barbarian soldiers slacked off, then broke out in one go." Li Modao was proud of this history.

"Liaodong's solid defense relies greatly on firearms." He Rubin asked, "Now Hair Thief firearms are not inferior to mine. If enemy and us share peril, how should firearms be deployed?"

Li Modao's face flushed with excitement; the Commander-in-Chief consulting him on strategy was a huge face-saving matter. He had thought about this many times, so he steadied himself and said:

"In this humble officer's shallow view, though Hair Thieves have tens of thousands of men, they are either Fujian/Guangdong traitors or coerced commoners—a mob. They definitely dare not fight field battles with our army. Their plan is nothing more than imitating the Red Hairs' old trick in Penghu: building strong stockades and mounting heavy cannons to defend a corner. After our troops surround them for long, since enemy and our cannon ranges differ little, our troops can dig trenches advancing to half a li or one li before enemy stockade walls. Trenches must be wide and deep enough for cannon carriages. Our cannons move forward from trench bottoms, approach stockade gates and walls to fire. My cannons can reach the enemy; their cannons cannot harm me."

"What if Hair Thieves sortie to capture cannons?"

"At each cannon position, deploy two squads of infantry equipped with Crouching Tiger cannons and three-barreled guns. Ready to fight anytime. My troops have deep trenches for cover; enemy cannons can't reach. If strength fails, fresh reinforcements can be sent anytime."

He glanced at He Rubin and added quickly: "This humble officer shows off before an expert; just a humble opinion."

He Rubin had never heard of such tactics: digging ditches on flat ground and having cannon carriages walk in ditch bottoms. He originally wanted to dismiss it as "absurd"! But thinking again, this method might not be useless. If Hair Thieves refused to retreat, it could be tried.

But he said neither good nor bad. Expressionless, he left amidst the crowd's surrounding.

Li Modao respectfully saw the Commander off cautiously. Feeling uneasy: didn't know if his speech pleased or displeased the Commander, or if it suited his taste. Commander He's favor was key to his career—he spent sixteen years climbing to a Defender rank and recently became a battalion commander; he cared about his future greatly.

"Master! Was the Commander satisfied with the Firearms Battalion?" Several trusted Thousand and Hundred Household officers crowded over after He Rubin left.

"How the hell should I know?" Li Modao said impatiently. "Just lead the brothers well! Looks like our Firearms Battalion will see big action in this expedition against Hair Thieves."

After subordinates dispersed, Li Modao glanced at the strange cannonballs awaiting collection by soldiers. He walked over, squatted, and looked carefully at the balls cast under the foreign monk's supervision. Although the new balls performed poorly when fired, Li Modao vaguely felt these balls each had their own uses, only he didn't know them.

"If I had someone around who knew Western gunnery, I could ask and understand," Li Modao thought.

Speaking of Western gunnery, Commander He was naturally the number one in the Liangguang army, but Li was just a small Defender; how dare he casually ask the Commander-in-Chief.

"Once the barrel is scrubbed clean, prepare to harness horses and return to camp." He ordered soldiers to clean the barrel and pack up.

Soldiers brought newly purchased Sichuan horses to harness the cannon. Sichuan horses were small and weak. Not only were these carriages made very clumsily, but lacking limbers, the draft horses had to pull forward while bearing weight on their backs. Efficiency of animal power was very poor; seven or eight horses were needed to barely pull it. Li Modao knew local Mongolian horses were rare, and Jiangnan and Guangdong didn't raise mules, so he had to make do with Sichuan horses.

"This horse has too little strength, not even as good as a mule," a squad leader beside him said.

"This is the small Sichuan horse of the south, smaller than a Shandong donkey," Li Modao said. "Pulling a cart, it can't match a donkey. Carrying goods on mountain paths is okay; pulling carts or cannons won't do."

"This humble officer sees many oxen here; why not use oxen?"

"Oxen become frightened easily." He shook his head. "And they're too slow. Once guns fire on the battlefield, won't oxen be startled and ruin things immediately?"

However, oxen had endurance and greater strength than these Sichuan horses barely dragging cannons. But the battalion had over thirty cannons exceeding a thousand catties; four oxen per cannon meant over a hundred oxen, plus corresponding handlers. He didn't know if Commander He was willing to pay this extra expense.

Returning to camp and settling the cannons, Li Modao went to the gunpowder workshop under Yaniangxie Mountain. About five or six li from the camp battery, a large patch of sheds served as a Gunpowder manufactory. Materials for making gunpowder—sulfur, charcoal, and saltpeter—were shipped here day and night from everywhere. Occasionally other things arrived too: dried human feces, toxic herbs like aconite, and lime, tung oil, etc.

As commander of the Firearms Battalion, Li Modao paid most attention to gunpowder supply. Although the government army didn't lack gunpowder, quality tried greatly. Bad powder only puffed black smoke, sometimes cannonballs fell out right after leaving the muzzle. Sometimes it was too strong and burst the barrel, often causing heavy casualties among gunners.

For this expedition, He Rubin commissioned him to handle gunpowder and shot manufacturing concurrently. Leading the Firearms Battalion, gunpowder and shot were matters of life and death, so he couldn't take it lightly.

Many large iron pots were set up in the sheds, boiling something and emitting foul smells. Li Modao knew this was purifying saltpeter and sulfur.

Not far away, three large stone grinding pans pulled by Sichuan horses crushed charcoal; many laborers were pounding ashes "thump, thump," and others were sifting ashes for fine black powder. Others mixed sulfur, saltpeter, and other things into charcoal powder according to prescribed ratios to make gunpowder.

The made gunpowder was put into stone troughs, where craftsmen constantly pounded it with thick wooden pestles. Old craftsmen sat aside, occasionally rubbing the powder with hands and adding clear water. Gunpowder had to be pounded as fine as possible; Li Modao remembered books prescribing over five thousand pounds. He didn't know how craftsmen counted.

Other craftsmen sprayed slightly sticky water soaked from wheat onto spread-out gunpowder, then used bamboo sieves to shake out granular gunpowder of various sizes.
