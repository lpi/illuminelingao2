# Chapter 721 - The Patrol Squadrons

Sunlight streamed through the window lattice. The old man lying on the bed stirred and groaned. Those standing or sitting by the bedside all rose at once.

The young woman hunched over the bed's edge suddenly lifted her head and supported the old man. His eyes were dazed, as if momentarily uncertain where he was.

"Where... is this..."

"At the inn." The young woman hurried to say. "The Luo family released us."

"Oh." The old man closed his eyes, seeming relieved. "This is... their territory... if they insist on taking the horse... just give it to them... if there's trouble, we outsiders will definitely suffer..."

"Father, rest easy. Lord Luo didn't take the horse. He had people escort us back to the inn."

"Oh." The old man relaxed, but suddenly his eyes opened again with an anxious expression. "He didn't demand that you..."

"No—" The young woman's eyes were already blurred with tears. "Lord Luo said nothing at all. He just had people bring us back."

"Oh." With these words the old man seemed reassured and lapsed back into unconsciousness.

A man of about forty said: "The old master's condition still doesn't look good. Should we leave immediately?"

"With his health, how can he travel? He'd die on the road." The middle-aged woman in the room spoke—her appearance was decent enough, just haggard. Like the young woman, she wore the short jacket and trousers of a traveling performer.

"I'm afraid if we don't leave, things will only get worse." The only young man in the room said. "What if the Luo family has bad intentions? What if Lord Luo gets ideas about Senior Sister?"

"The Luo family are the local tyrants here—they could do whatever they wanted. If he wanted to harm your senior sister, he could have done it earlier. Once we were in his compound, we were at his mercy. He wouldn't have released us just to cause trouble later." The middle-aged man said.

"Who knows what scheme he's plotting. These rich people—not a single one is decent." The young man had a wound on his face, evidently from beatings by the militia. He said indignantly, "Just looking at his lackeys, you know the master isn't any good either."

The middle-aged woman glanced nervously at the window: "Good or bad, it's none of our business. Let the old master recover for a few days. Once he can travel, we'll leave. Only we've got no money left. With our horses and equipment, we need to hire a larger boat. We'll have to perform for a few more days."

This time, an epidemic in Sanliang Market had struck down the whole troupe in turns. Unable to perform, the lodging, doctors, and medicine had consumed all their savings—otherwise they wouldn't have fallen into the moneylender's usury trap.

"Sanliang Market is actually a good venue—lots of spectators, decent money per show. But now with this incident, we can't perform with peace of mind." The middle-aged man sighed.

The young man spoke up: "I think Senior Sister shouldn't go out to perform anymore! Who knows what trouble might arise."

Everyone in the room fell silent. The young man made sense, but their troupe's star attraction was precisely this young woman—Qingxia, her stage name "Rival to the Azure Cloud." Hers was a family tradition of performance arts. Not only was her horsemanship superhuman, but archery, slingshot, sword dancing, balancing bowls, tightrope walking—she excelled at everything. Though the others had their own genuine skills, having a woman—especially a reasonably attractive young woman—performing equestrian stunts meant each show brought in fifty or sixty percent more money.

If "Rival to the Azure Cloud" didn't perform, who knew how long it would take to scrape together travel money. Besides, the old master's condition might not truly be improving. Lodging and medicine all cost money.

Qingxia raised her head: "I'll still go perform! We know something about how things work in this town now—the Luo family are tigers. Since the tiger didn't eat us and let us out of its jaws, the other hungry wolves and dogs probably won't bother us either."

"Senior Sister!" The young man said anxiously.

"Xiaosuo, don't try to persuade me." Qingxia had made up her mind. "I'm this troupe's star. If I don't perform, the money comes slowly, and we'll be even more stuck."

Jiang Suo muttered a few more objections, but the others in the room had brightened up. They traveled performing exactly to earn a living. This place was good for business. If the star didn't perform, how could they and a few children hold up the show?

The next day, the troupe continued performing at the threshing ground. Though Guangdong had suffered several disasters since the Wanli reign and various disturbances and banditry had risen and fallen, overall it was much better than the northern Central Plains. The commoners still had passable lives. Rural entertainment was scarce, so with a young woman performing equestrian stunts, not just the townspeople but villagers from nearby with spare time came to watch. The first day's business was quite good. And no one came to harass them.

Seeing such good business, everyone performed with all their might. To earn more, Qingxia decided to display her archery skills that she normally didn't perform. This was a family-transmitted art. Though as a woman Qingxia couldn't draw very powerful bows, with an ordinary infantry bow her accuracy was practically one hundred percent. Especially her skill of shooting coins while on horseback—a secret technique passed down through generations.

When this skill was displayed, it caused enormous sensation. More and more people came from all around to watch. Several militia instructors in town watched and secretly praised: this was genuine skill, not empty showmanship.

They earned considerable money, but the old master's condition actually worsened. They'd tried every doctor in town and taken all sorts of medicines, but nothing helped. Everyone grew increasingly anxious—they'd been here almost three months. A month of performing would normally be enough, but now only their few special skills were temporarily sustaining them. Continuing like this, supporting themselves would become difficult.

Just as they were at their wits' end, terrifying news spread through the town: the crop-heads had come.

---

Chen Haiyang, resting and resupplying at the Bogue, had already received reports: the government troops were establishing heavy defenses at Wuchong with extensive fortifications and concentrated forces. So his instructions to the squadron commanders were to temporarily avoid entering the Provincial River zone—meaning not to pass Wuchong. He planned to wait until enemy forces had concentrated sufficiently, then strike in one decisive blow to completely destroy Guangzhou's will to resist.

In the meantime, he ordered the patrol squadrons to strike in all directions to further undermine the morale of Guangzhou's officials, gentry, and populace.

The patrol squadrons were designated by English letters. Each squadron operated independently. Though squadron commanders were authorized to initiate independent actions including military attacks, Chen Haiyang strictly prohibited any squadron from conducting village annihilations or collective massacres without permission. Balanced use of mercy and might was his guiding principle. To ensure no squadron suffered defeats that would damage their image, each squadron was required to use peaceful means as much as possible rather than relying purely on military action.

Wen Desi volunteered to lead a squadron deep into the Pearl River banks. Though Chen Haiyang expressed concern for his safety, Chief Wen bravely declared: this bit of danger was nothing.

"Those who fear death don't make revolution! In our cause, we can't just sit in offices reading documents and issuing orders. We must take up real swords and guns and fight the old powers!" Chief Wen declared grandly at the Bogue's temporary pier to Chen Haiyang and others. With that, he strode toward his boat.

D Squadron, under his command, raised sail and, propelled by sail and oar, slowly headed upriver.

D Squadron comprised ten sampans and five long-dragons. Over two hundred marines and sailors, plus about ten civil affairs personnel. They carried one cannon and various engineering equipment. The long-dragons were larger, able to store supplies and transport cannons. They could also accommodate comfortable sleeping quarters. Wen Desi's "flagship" was aboard a long-dragon; the modest cabin had been carefully arranged and decorated, with high ratings for both safety and comfort.

The expeditionary force organized six squadrons in total. They dispersed to the townships within Dongguan, Xin'an, Shunde, Xiangshan, Nanhai, and Panyu counties, posting proclamations everywhere and collecting "Reasonable Burden." Guangzhou Prefecture was alarmed.

Xu Tingfa's passive avoidance of battle left the squadrons operating in the Pearl River tributaries virtually unopposed. Guided by former pirates familiar with the waterways, the squadrons penetrated various channels. These former pirates knew the surrounding terrain intimately—which towns were wealthy, which were heavily defended with fierce militia and were "hard targets," which were isolated and were "soft targets."

D Squadron's objective was Shunde. The squadron sailed along the rivers, issuing proclamations to villages and towns, establishing the "Reasonable Burden" system everywhere. This required almost no effort—under the Australians' reputation, most villages and towns dared not resist, accepting the proclamations and "Reasonable Burden."

For villages and towns that didn't resist, the squadron not only refrained from harassment and extortion but paid cash for all requisitioned supplies and labor. The Reasonable Burden quotas were quite reasonable, not exceeding village capacity. Some were even quite light.

D Squadron's first encounter with resistance occurred at Sanshan. After their demands were rejected, Wen Desi ordered an assault. A 12-pounder howitzer mounted on a long-dragon quickly blasted a gap over ten meters wide in the bamboo palisade the villagers had built. The militia behind the palisade gathered at the gap, firing arrows like rain, trying to stop the soldiers from breaking through. Several crude cannons fired intermittently, but the distance was still too great to hit anyone. The soldiers used Minié rifles and the 12-pounder mountain howitzer to bombard the breakthrough point heavily from long range, quickly routing the militia gathered behind the palisade. They left a ground strewn with corpses. Then soldiers quickly deployed a lightweight engineer's bridge from the boat across the ditch and entered the village.

Sanshan Village was already in total chaos. Women, elderly, and children scrambled to escape. The ground was littered with abandoned shoes, bundles, and various objects. But the ditches and palisades that had protected the village now blocked their escape. D Squadron set up blockade lines at several exits, trapping all villagers inside.

Afterward, a village-wide assembly was held at the threshing ground. Villagers were herded there to await their fate. A sea of black heads milled about. Surrounding marines and sailors stood with bayonet-fixed rifles or raised machetes, blades glinting.

In the middle of the threshing ground stood something the villagers had never seen—a wide wooden frame with nooses hanging from it.

Captured prisoners knelt weakly to one side. Among them were prominent village figures—anyone who could organize militia had some property. Most held examination degrees; at minimum they were wealthy landowners.

According to Wen Desi's standard thinking, resistance demanded severe punishment. But this Pearl River expedition wasn't about establishing a long-term base. Excessive punishment might instead inspire local resistance. So the policy toward local resistance was "moderate punishment, divide the masses, strike the magnates."

As retaliation for resisting the Australians, the village's militia commander, training leaders, and militia instructors—except those already killed or missing—were all hanged before the assembled villagers. Their property was completely confiscated. As for ordinary people—commoners and militiamen—the civil affairs propagandists announced that everyone had been used and coerced by the wealthy magnates. So after weapons were confiscated, no further punishment would follow. Any future attacks on Australasian Song personnel or refusal of Reasonable Burden would result in "more severe retaliation."

Even the current retaliation was severe. Death sentences were waived, but living punishment remained. After negotiation, Sanshan Village's entire population paid gold, silver, fabric, rice, and other goods equivalent to roughly a thousand taels of silver. Their assigned Reasonable Burden was also calculated at triple the normal rate.

D Squadron stayed one night at Sanshan, then continued upriver. They successively occupied Mazhou, Sanshan, and Pingzhou. Villagers there, having heard of Sanshan's fate, dared not resist. The Reasonable Burden system was easily established. The boats soon filled with tribute. Then D Squadron arrived at Shawan. Shawan's terrain favored defenders—surrounded by water, densely wooded, and residents had built embankments along the shore, embedding many bamboo stakes.

D Squadron anchored before Shawan for the night. The next morning, Wen Desi discovered the Shawan shores were densely packed with militia—a forest of weapons. Various strange flags flew along the riverbank.

The moment the squadron's boats moved, Shawan's militia fired a volley—over a dozen crude cannons firing together created an impressive spectacle. Smoke shrouded the entire riverbank, but the projectiles were mostly nails, iron scraps, broken porcelain, and pebbles. They fell into the river barely ten meters out, entirely ineffective.

The long-dragons' cannons and Minié rifles fired simultaneously, instantly clearing the riverbank defenses. Then under covering fire, sampans carried marines toward the shore. The militiamen shouted loudly, firing guns and cannons randomly, but the Minié rifles' accurate fire quickly dispersed them. When the militia realized the crop-heads could shoot them from far beyond their own range—while even their cannons couldn't reach the enemy—this terrifying reality immediately shook their morale. Then a crude cannon suddenly exploded, killing or wounding over a dozen men. This accident triggered the complete collapse of the Shawan militia. Though the local militia commander Liang Kefa led his household guards in attempted resistance, he and his guards were quickly bayoneted by the marines. Over a dozen more militia commanders, deputy commanders, training leaders, and instructors from various villages were killed or captured. These key personnel had all stood at the front to boost morale; during the rout, most failed to escape.

D Squadron took only an hour and a half that morning to rout over a thousand militia jointly sent by six nearby villages. After killing and capturing a third of them, Shawan and neighboring villages sent envoys to submit. They not only paid one tael of silver per prisoner as ransom but also paid several thousand taels in "reparations." Wen Desi ordered execution of captured militia commanders and training leaders from among the local gentry, following the Sanshan precedent, and confiscated their movable property. Ordinary commoners were forgiven for the past, and troops maintained strict discipline throughout—no looting, arson, or rape. This balanced approach of severity and leniency, treating different groups differently, greatly reduced commoners' interest in resisting the Fubo Army. The gentry and magnates were scared out of their wits and dared not consider armed resistance again.

While Wen Desi's squadron rampaged through Shunde's waterways, Shi Zhiqi's E Squadron roved freely along the Pearl River's main channel, encountering no opposition. He continuously burned numerous river-patrol stations, patrol-inspector offices, and other government facilities along the banks. After capturing Daojiao and Dafen islands, which had attempted resistance, Shi Zhiqi led his troops to seize a battery under construction south of Xiangshan County. He scattered the hundreds of militia defending it, then demolished the battery before appearing beneath Xiangshan's walls. Though Shi Zhiqi had fewer than two hundred men and a dozen boats, the Xiangshan County Magistrate, shocked by his unstoppable advance and pressured by terrified local gentry, ultimately abandoned plans for armed resistance. He dispatched several gentry to negotiate terms, ultimately buying Shi Zhiqi's withdrawal with five thousand taels of "city-ransom." This experience gave the transmigrators new insight: local officials were often willing to seek compromise.

All squadrons' operations along the Pearl River proceeded smoothly. Even where fighting occurred, casualties were very light. Squadron commanders followed their instructions: never fight far from the waterways—as long as they stayed near water, they could receive effective fire support from cannons mounted on long-dragons. They never spent nights in local villages, preferring to camp outdoors or sleep aboard their boats—the latter lesson learned from the work teams' experience in Danzhou.

Shi Zhiqi returned to the Bogue once—to unload spoils, prisoners, and few wounded from this patrol. After reloading supplies and rotating some personnel, he led the squadron toward Dongguan County. This time, his target was Sanliang Market.
