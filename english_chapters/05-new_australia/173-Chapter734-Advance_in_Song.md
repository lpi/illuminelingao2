# Chapter 734 - Advance in Song

"We can smelt another furnace of good steel," Chen Haiyang joked, watching Dai Xie of the Planning Agency's Action Team greedily recording numbers in his notebook.

"Not just one—several. Just melting down these cannons and iron shot will yield so much pig iron." Dai Xie, as Director of the Planning Agency's Investigation and Statistics Division, rarely visited the front lines. His personally leading the "Home-Raiding Team"—the Special Search Action Team—to the Pearl River Delta showed the high hopes Wu De placed on capturing vast supplies from the region. Indeed, the Planning Agency harvested abundantly. Especially the cannons captured from various forts—even a *Folangji* could yield two or three hundred kilograms of molten iron, let alone the Red Barbarian Cannons weighing thousands of *jin*.

Cannons dismantled by Marines piled up like small hills on the beach, including 12 precious bronze cannons. With no transport ships available yet, they had to wait for the follow-up supply fleet.

The *Great Whale* puffed black smoke, working intensely. Steam winches pulled up the wooden piles driven into the riverbed one by one. These blocking piles were simply hammered down by laborers with mallets, not by mechanical pile drivers, so they were barely stable in the riverbed. The steam winch pulled them out effortlessly. The crane and specially prepared steel cables weren't even needed.

The Planning Agency, famous for its frugality, didn't spare the hundreds of extracted piles. Several sailors who had been raftsmen wove them into rafts, preparing to tow them back to Humen.

After clearing underwater obstacles, scouts found a line of ships moored across the river a few kilometers from Wuchong, filled with sand and stones. Clearly another water barrier. Chen Haiyang thought it fortunate the Ming army hadn't sunk them yet; otherwise, while useless against current wooden ships, they would severely impact the navigation of future 10,000-ton giant ships.

However, according to the survey ship, government forces had indeed sunk a number of ships in the channel. Though tides, currents, and sinking issues made the blocking line intermittent and incomplete, water depth in some areas was reduced to about 1-2 meters. The survey ship marked all dangerous shallow areas with buoys.

The *Great Whale* began dismantling obstacles in sections that might affect navigation. Steam launches towed the sand-filled ships to shore, using captives from Wuchong as labor. Chen Haiyang ordered a brief rest to clean guns and prepare to continue upstream. Meanwhile, he sent Marines to nearby villages to post notices and collect "Reasonable Burden."

No village dared resist anymore. Even before Marines arrived, elders and wealthy households from nearby villages sent people with gifts and "rewards," expressing willingness to accept all Australian conditions. Nearby villagers rowed small boats out to sell vegetables, fruits, meat, and alcohol. Conflicts even arose with civilian boats following the fleet to do business.

Wuchong's surroundings suddenly gathered many small boats, forming a temporary but bustling water market. Finally, even boats carrying prostitutes arrived. While they couldn't do business with the Task Force, the prostitutes earned quite a bit from sailors and merchants on other civilian boats.

Seeing the gathering of civilian boats growing, Chen Haiyang feared water-braves might mix in for a sneak attack. He ordered all civilian boats to anchor at the mouth of the Wuchong River and forbade entry into the fleet's anchorage waters. A distance of 100 meters had to be maintained to prevent enemy fire-ship attacks.

So many small boats came selling goods that Chen Haiyang found that as long as his fleet had money to pay, he didn't need the special supply convoy to bring food—rice, poultry, eggs, vegetables, fruits, even oil, salt, sauce, vinegar, and alcohol could be bought from small boats at reasonable prices.

Chen Haiyang ordered the purchase of large quantities of citrus fruits to supplement vitamins for the soldiers. He also authorized direct purchase of food from small boat vendors if the price was right and hygiene wasn't an issue.

He was surprised that the common people did business so nonchalantly with the "bandits" who had beaten the "government army" into fleeing rats. Although this phenomenon benefited the Fubo Army, the people's willingness to act as "Ming traitors" made him uncomfortable.

While feeling uncomfortable, another "delegation" arrived. This time, shipowners and merchants stranded in Huangpu Port. Trapped by the fighting, afraid to sail, they heard the bandits had conquered Wuchong. Huangpu Port was now like a naked woman tied to a bed—the bandits could take it whenever and however many times they wanted. The owners of over two thousand ships in the harbor were terrified. Sailors and helmsmen had fled, as had the officials and runners of the Huangpu River Police Office.

Shipowners and cargo owners had to elect a ten-person delegation to Wuchong to request "grace" from the Australians. They were willing to pay fifty thousand taels of silver as "ransom" in exchange for a promise not to confiscate cargoes or burn ships.

"We beg Your Excellency's grace!" The leading merchant kowtowed heavily on the floor. Behind him, others followed suit. Their heads banged loudly on the deck.

Wen Desi raised his hand with great airs—it felt good to play the overlord: "Rise. No need to kowtow."

"Thank you, Your Excellency." The leader bowed with hands clasped again before carefully standing up, head bowed, waiting for instructions.

"Your name is... hmm..."

"This lowly one is Qin Haicheng," the lead merchant said carefully.

"An ocean merchant?"

Qin Haicheng tensed, hesitated a moment, then said: "Yes, this lowly one is an ocean merchant."

"Where do you trade?"

"Replying to Your Excellency, the Luzons..."

"Must have made quite a bit of money."

Qin Haicheng shivered, daring not answer. Fearing a wrong word would lead to heavy extortion.

Wen Desi probably realized his words were inappropriate. He quickly changed tone:

"We can forgo the silver," Wen Desi said grandly, "but I have other demands."

"Yes, please instruct us, Your Excellency!" Hearing the silver wasn't needed, Qin Haicheng sighed in relief, but thought the "demands" might have a cost far harsher than fifty thousand taels.

The first demand was "Harmonious Purchase." Basically, they would send personnel to inspect cargoes on all merchant ships. Any goods needed by Lingao would be subject to "Harmonious Purchase." The price would be the wholesale price in Guangzhou plus 10% for shipping and gross profit.

All ships with goods subject to "Harmonious Purchase" must sail to Hong Kong, then be convoyed to Lingao for unloading. With foreign trade cut off, Lingao had great demand for many goods. Huangpu Port held over 2,000 ships, many being merchant vessels laden with diverse goods. A one-time "Harmonious Purchase" would yield massive supplies. Of course, this purchase had a predatory nature—much cheaper than normal purchasing prices between Lingao and Guangzhou in the past. However, it still left shipowners and cargo owners some profit, sparing them from loss.

Though strict, this condition was bearable. Qin Haicheng sighed in relief—he didn't worry about Australians not paying—their commercial reputation in Guangdong was very good.

The second demand sounded less like a demand and more like a suggestion. He simply discussed the superior geographical location of Hong Kong Island, now under Australian control, and its complete port services. He hoped everyone would frequent Hong Kong Island to dock, load, and sell—as for transshipment, river boats could handle the transfer.

Though spoken politely, these words carried compulsion. According to the Central Administration Council, Planning Agency, and General Staff's plan, while the Task Force's main body would return to Lingao after the Guangzhou campaign, control of the Pearl River waterway would not be relinquished. Light patrol fleets based in Hong Kong would constantly patrol the estuary and river, forcing merchant ships entering and leaving the Pearl River to trade in Hong Kong. Ultimately making Hong Kong Guangzhou's main outer port and the gateway for South China's foreign and coastal trade.

"Yes, yes, this lowly one understands." Qin Haicheng wondered why they valued Hong Kong Island so much. He knew Hong Kong—a desolate island. despite its size and good anchorage, ordinary merchant ships dared not go there—it was a pirate haven. Did the Australians occupying Hong Kong intend to turn it into another Macau?

"Good that you understand." Wen Desi smiled. "Just ensure your hearts match your mouths. Do not feign compliance while acting otherwise."

"This lowly one dares not!" Qin Haicheng was so scared he almost knelt again. "This lowly one will certainly send ships to Hong Kong to dock and trade!" Others also expressed firm resolve to trade at Hong Kong.

"Alright, you may go. The river and sea are now peaceful. Trade where you wish. As long as you commit no hostile acts, my Navy will never block or attack civilian ships."

"Thank you, Your Excellency." Qin Haicheng was astonished to be let off without spending a penny. But thinking of Hong Kong, he felt a chill—likely some "butcher's knife" awaited them there. But now the Pearl River belonged to the Australians; one "disobey" meant loss of ship and cargo, perhaps even life. It seemed either quit maritime trade or obediently go to Hong Kong to pay tribute. He estimated the Australian price would be at most similar to Liu Xiang's.

Wen Desi smiled, "However, regarding Huangpu Port, your merchant ships should visit less in the future. To avoid implicating everyone when we set fires or fire cannons."

"Dare not, dare not! This lowly one will never come to Huangpu Port again! We will go entirely to Hong Kong Island for trade."

Then Chen Haiyang ordered a Marine company and two Special Service Boat squadrons to accompany the representatives to Huangpu. Dai Xie led Planning Agency indigenous clerks to conduct "Harmonious Purchase"—every owner had to submit manifests for review. Any refusal or falsification led to confiscation of ship and cargo.

Qin Haicheng announced the policy to the owners gathered on shore. Hearing they didn't need to pay cash, everyone relaxed. Although Harmonious Purchase meant less profit, overall loss was limited. As for trading at Hong Kong Island, they concluded it was just imitating Zheng Zhilong's old trick. Before surrendering to the Ming, Zheng Zhilong had repeatedly attacked Moon Harbor, burning ships and razing streets, to force Fujian coastal trade to his controlled Zhongzuosuo. The Australians wanted to use this method to generate revenue.

Merchants had no choice but to accept all conditions—knowing the Australians were already being merciful. They could have taken the fifty thousand taels or extorted a hundred thousand and *still* imposed these demands, and they would have had to accept.

Marines landed, destroyed Huangpu's port facilities and River Police Office, and set the office on fire.

The Task Force continued upstream the next day, effortlessly crushing defenses at Pazhou and Qinzhou. Defenders fired their guns hastily and fled. Special Service Boats didn't even have time to return fire.

Subsequent battles could hardly be called battles. Ming morale hit rock bottom; neither water-braves nor naval troops had the will to attack. Even when defending forts, they refused to exert themselves—since only the enemy could hit them and they couldn't hit the enemy, what was the point of defending?

Only at Liede and Ershawei did the Task Force encounter trouble—not from forts, but from thoroughly blocked channels. The *Great Whale* had to spend two or three hours clearing obstacles at each section. During this time, forts at Liede and Ershawei fired only token shots, taking no measures to disrupt the clearing work. Once Special Service Boats fired, the battle ended.

Now, the Task Force had advanced to within three or four kilometers of Bai'etan. Aside from a few hastily built sandbag batteries, nothing stood between the Australians and Bai'etan. This terrifying prospect threw Guangzhou into chaos. Flower boats on Bai'etan scattered overnight, fleeing up the West River. Gentry and wealthy families fled the city in droves; shops closed; commoners unable to flee barred their doors. Many lawless elements in the suburbs raised Australian flags, proclaiming titles like "Great Song Vanguard against Ming," "Australian Marquis of Dingyuan," "Great Australian Guerrilla General of Guangdong," "Great Kun Nation Frontline Commander," "Australian Left Vanguard," "Australian-Song Guangdong Seal-Holding Vanguard"... names blossoming everywhere. Knowing Australians used red or blue-and-white flags, various red or blue-and-white banners flew all around Guangzhou's countryside. These bandit gangs looted, robbed, and extorted, causing panic.

The Task Force moved slowly, sweeping away bandits and routiers along the way—villages and towns dared not resist, but bandits everywhere using the "Australian" banner seriously affected the Fubo Army's reputation. The Task Force launched large-scale search-and-seize operations. After wiping out a dozen bandit gangs claiming to be Australian troops and executing several criminal leaders, this trend in the Henan Island area largely ended.

Under Li Fengjie's pressure, Xu Tingfa was forced to launch a final major counterattack on the Pearl River—everyone from Li Fengjie down to the rice-bowl water-braves knew this was the last chance to drive back the bandits. Xu Tingfa deployed the Ming navy's ultimate weapon—fire ships.

Since the Portuguese first knocked on the gate, the most effective tactical means for the Ming navy against European naval power (technologically superior in ships and guns) was fire ships. Massive numbers of fire ships, piloted by daredevils promised heavy rewards, would ram enemy ships under cover of warships. In narrow waters, fewer, taller, clumsier European ships lacking light vessel cover often suffered heavy damage. This had been a tried-and-true method against European ships since the mid-Ming.

Desperate, Xu Tingfa thought of this tactic again. Compared to the open Pearl River estuary, fire attacks seemed more likely to succeed in Guangzhou's inland rivers. Channels were narrow; bandit ships were dense and hard to maneuver; numerous bays allowed fire ships to hide and strike.

Xu Tingfa consulted his generals, who agreed it was feasible. But fire attacks consumed many ships, and the navy itself lacked them. The Governor had to solve this.

For Li Fengjie, as long as the bandits didn't enter Bai'etan, anything went. He issued orders commanding the Guangzhou Prefect and Magistrates of Nanhai and Panyu to seize ships in the West and North Rivers. Regardless of size, all were sent to Bai'etan. Fishing boats, cargo ships, and flower boats just fled from Bai'etan fell victim, seized indiscriminately. Corrupt officials and navy generals took the opportunity to engage in malpractice, seizing ships everywhere in the name of war. Owners with money and connections pulled strings to redeem their ships; penniless commoners watched helplessly as their livelihoods were piled with firewood, doused with oil, and prepared for burning—crying to heaven was useless.

In two days, the navy gathered over fifty fire ships of various types in Bai'etan and the West River, plus over a hundred hastily made fire rafts for drifting attacks. All were loaded with fuel, with large iron spikes added to prows. Xu Tingfa recruited water-skilled daredevils from water-braves, fishermen, and navy soldiers, promising ten taels silver upfront, twenty more upon return, and ten taels pension for death. High rewards attracted over three hundred men.
