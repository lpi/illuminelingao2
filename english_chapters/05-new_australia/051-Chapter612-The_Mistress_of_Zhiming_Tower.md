# Chapter 612 - The Mistress of Zhiming Tower

The crowd was stunned into silence. Setting aside six hundred thousand taels—even scraping together three hundred thousand would require a battle with the Guangdong provincial treasury. As for the Guangxi treasury, Guangxi's garrison forces themselves relied on subsidies from Guangdong; they couldn't be counted on at all.

Seeing the atmosphere grow somewhat dejected, Lü Yizhong quickly changed the subject: "How many troops and ships to deploy must be decided by the Governor-General in consultation with the Governor and General He. Let's set that aside for now and discuss other matters."

The advisors then discussed which forces to mobilize, how to advance, how to cross the sea, how to coordinate with local garrison troops, and so forth. But Lü Yizhong's mind wasn't on these matters. After going through the motions for a while, he excused himself, claiming urgent business, and entrusted the meeting to Li Xijue before taking his leave.

The moment he stepped out of the Governor-General's residence, his whole body felt relaxed. His mood was quite elated and excited. Because the opportunity he'd been hoping for had finally arrived.

He'd been secretly planning this matter for a long time, just waiting for such an opportunity. Though he'd anticipated the opportunity would come soon, he hadn't expected it to arrive so quickly.

At this moment, though he maintained an outward calm, inwardly he was somewhat anxious. As he climbed into his four-bearer sedan chair, he impatiently stomped on the floorboard:

"Zhiming Tower."

The bearers were just about to lift the sedan when Lü Yizhong felt it wasn't right and stomped again: "Go back to my residence!"

He felt it wasn't appropriate to visit Zhiming Tower right now. The news about attacking Lingao hadn't yet spread. After the meeting dispersed, it would naturally get out. When Miss Pei and Mr. Guo were in a state of panic and uncertainty, they would naturally come to invite him.

Thinking of this, he felt quite pleased with his own cleverness. First let this Mr. Guo wallow in anxiety for a while. When the whole city was abuzz with rumors, he'd naturally understand.

Besides, though Guo Yi had only been in Guangzhou for two or three years, his social connections were quite extensive. He'd established channels to almost every wealthy gentry and high official inside and outside Guangzhou city. If he had some powerful figure or strong backer who hadn't yet shown their face, this "beating the grass to startle the snake" move would be enough to make them reveal themselves. That way, he wouldn't rush in too eagerly and hit a wall for nothing.

The late-morning sunlight shone on the carved window lattices, and the glass embedded in them cast reflections on the snow-white plastered walls. The room was furnished with rosewood tables and chairs, an exquisite gilded screen painted with flowers and plants. A full-length crystal mirror—the most extravagant piece of furniture in all Guangzhou—stood in an elaborately carved rosewood frame, covered with a brocade mirror cover. Two shelves held thread-bound books kept immaculately clean. A Western enamel incense burner decorated with animal designs was slowly emitting wisps of sandalwood and aloeswood smoke, its faint, subtle fragrance drifting through the room.

On the wall hung a scroll by an unknown landscape painter, seemingly expressing the owner's distinctive tastes. Below the painting was an elegant antique *qin* zither. Judging by its ancient patina, it was clearly an authentic Tang or Song dynasty piece—worth a fortune.

This neat, comfortable boudoir, decorated with silks, satins, gold, and jade, appeared luxurious and splendid. At this moment, the room's owner—the mistress of Zhiming Tower, Pei Lixiu—was reclining on a canopy bed draped with tasseled gauze curtains, her head on a white satin pillow embroidered with red flowers, sleeping soundly.

The late-morning sunlight fell on the walls, and the room's originally dim, comfortable light gradually brightened. Finally, she opened her eyes, seeming unaccustomed to such bright light in the room. She closed her eyes again for a moment, then slowly extended one snow-white arm from beneath the red cloud-satin quilt, followed by the other, stretching languidly.

Though her arms were snow-white, they appeared slightly plump. Two twisted-wire silver bracelets tightly encircled her wrists, with small emerald gems dangling from fine chains attached to them.

"This annoying sunlight," Pei Lixiu muttered, slowly sitting up from the bed and yawning without the slightest ladylike grace.

According to the customs of prominent Ming Dynasty households, when a mistress of the house like her stirred, without needing to be summoned, her personal maids would appear at the slightest sound, chatting pleasantly while helping her dress and wash. But Pei Lixiu's boudoir observed a strict policy of no entry without permission. No servants or maids were allowed to enter her boudoir without being called.

She sat dazedly on the bed for half the morning before seemingly coming to her senses. Lazily, she got out of bed, slipped on a pair of embroidered slippers, and slowly made her way to the bathroom.

The bathroom was completely modern in style. Except for the absence of shiny stainless steel—though what was here was far more extravagant, with all plumbing fixtures made of bronze.

She hastily undressed, took out a well-used plastic shower cap from a drawer, and carefully pinned up her black hair. After repeatedly checking in the mirror that no hair was exposed, she stepped into the bathtub.

The dial indicating the roof water tank's status—somewhat like a ship's engine order telegraph—showed 70%. There was enough water in the tank for a comfortable shower. Otherwise, she'd have to pull the handle on the dial. The servants below would then quickly lead out the ox and drive it to run on a treadmill that powered a pump to fill the tank. This process took at least fifteen minutes. Though she had modern bathroom facilities, the supporting infrastructure was still too primitive.

After bathing, she sat in the dressing room outside the bathroom. Looking at her reflection in the mirror, her eyes were puffy—yesterday she'd merely made a brief appearance to socialize in the private rooms and had already gotten thoroughly drunk. This was all because of Zhiming Tower's rum cocktails, which had been far too successful. Rum mixed with *kvass*, combined with various fruit juices and distilled floral and herbal essences, made this fashionable drink endlessly varied and had instantly captivated Guangzhou's officials and nobles. Everyone who visited Zhiming Tower considered it an honor to drink one.

At least her head no longer ached. The hangover soup had worked well. Pei Lixiu noticed some fine wrinkles at the corners of her eyes—she frowned slightly, reminding herself to do a cucumber or fruit face mask tonight, or follow the method Su Ai—Gao Shunqing's favored concubine—had recommended: applying egg whites mixed with pearl powder to the face.

Pei Lixiu spent another ten minutes considering this problem, until the rosewood grandfather clock in the room chimed eleven times. Only then did she suddenly snap to attention—today was the day for hosting the "salon," or as it was called in this time-space, the "elegant gathering."

This gathering was specifically organized for the ladies who came to Zhiming Tower for entertainment. Pei Lixiu had become acquainted with quite a few concubines from local officials and prominent families. Most of these concubines had originally been famous courtesans from Guangzhou, and quite a few were renowned courtesans their masters had purchased and brought back from Jiangnan. Whether in appearance, bearing, or talents and knowledge, they were a hundred times superior to ordinary women. Such women were mostly quick-witted and sharp-minded, having experienced all manner of situations. Having spent long years confined to mansion compounds, though they enjoyed silk clothes, rich food, and the service of maids and servants, they were inwardly quite empty. Zhiming Tower, this place filled with novel things, became a magnet drawing them in.

Pei Lixiu had taken advantage of opportunities to "build connections" and "find channels" while accompanying Guo Yi, meeting many such women. Though Pei Lixiu knew nothing of poetry or prose, relying on her identity as the mistress of Zhiming Tower and her frank, uninhibited personality, she'd still won quite a bit of goodwill. Over time, she'd established connections with the concubines of many prominent households, becoming close confidantes.

These connections to the inner quarters were very useful to the Guangzhou Station. First, there was attracting deposits—concubines of wealthy families had their own private savings and hoped to place them in reliable establishments to grow their money. Pei Lixiu used her connections to bring in many deposits for Delong Bank's Guangzhou branch. When the Guangzhou Station encountered situations difficult to handle, Pei Lixiu would ask her confidantes to whisper pillow talk at opportune moments—it almost always worked.

Because her work was so effective, Guo Yi approved almost all her various requests. Zhiming Tower's novelties emerged in an endless stream—many were specially made in Lingao and Purple Treasure Studio. The "elegant gatherings" Pei Lixiu organized also gradually grew more and more famous, to the point where recently even some principal wives and daughters of prominent families had been scheming to get onto the invitation list in order to build connections for their husbands and fathers.

But Pei Lixiu knew that relying solely on an endless stream of modern novelties to attract them wouldn't be enough. Each of them was worldly and well-informed; over time, they would naturally tire of such clever little tricks. Generally speaking, they were very similar to twentieth-century literary young women. They needed to be attracted by something that made them feel superior to ordinary "vulgar" people.

Poetry, prose, music, chess, calligraphy, and painting were of course the weapons with which they could look down on the vast majority of women in this time-space. But this was precisely Pei Lixiu's greatest weakness.

Pei Lixiu knew that if not for her mysterious identity as an "Australian woman" and her status as mistress of this Zhiming Tower full of novelties, these talented women probably wouldn't have given her a second glance.

Pei Lixiu knew her own learning was limited. Trying to crash-study these subjects at this point probably wouldn't produce any results. She had to work with things they didn't know and couldn't do.

What she was most confident about was, first, dressing, makeup, and skincare. But in clothing, she was already at a disadvantage—she could only follow local customs and wear Ming-style women's clothing. Modern women's clothing, whether dresses or jeans, might work as "boudoir fun," but wearing them publicly would be "scandalous."

As for makeup and skincare secrets, ancient people were no less skilled than modern people in this regard—almost every woman from a wealthy family had her own secret methods for cosmetics and beauty treatments. They were merely more limited in materials: some cosmetics contained toxic ingredients, others had less obvious effects. The biggest bottleneck for ancient cosmetics and skincare products was inconvenience of use and susceptibility to spoilage. The lipstick tubes, eyebrow pencils, perfumes, and similar items sold by Purple Treasure Studio were so popular largely because of their convenience.

After careful consideration, Pei Lixiu decided to focus on this area, organizing something like a beauty salon. Heavily promoting all-natural beauty treatments. The transmigrator collective had abundant materials available on this topic. Someone's computer even contained complete video tutorials from a beauty salon—including not just full courses on beauty treatment and skincare, but also ear candling, uterine care, full-body massage, medicinal baths, aromatherapy baths, breast massage, and even beauty enemas.

After reviewing these, she felt even more confident. She immediately began acquiring equipment, training personnel, and ordering various novelties from the Light Industry Department. And Zheng Shangjie's arrival had made her even more powerful. Zheng Shangjie was a smooth talker, even more skilled at adaptation and quick thinking than her. But she was already a married woman, and by Ming standards, her age was on the older side—it would be hard to make much of a splash. So she could only provide behind-the-scenes support, offering advice and counsel. When necessary, she could also handle hospitality and socializing.

But the supplies still hadn't all arrived. Communicating with people at the Light Industry Department was rather difficult. They were all men, and all had studied science and engineering. It was very hard for her to explain precisely what she needed. She didn't know either the composition or the structure of these things. She could only describe them in sensory terms. The result was either they didn't understand what she wanted, or the samples they produced didn't meet requirements at all.

A few days ago, Zheng Shangjie had specifically returned to Lingao, taking a list of everything she wanted. Zheng Shangjie said she'd go to the Grand Library as soon as she returned to Lingao to research and find pictures and structural diagrams for each item. If necessary, she'd go directly to the workshops to explain.

"I wonder how things are going?" Pei Lixiu muttered. Languidly, she changed into her clothes. Today she'd chosen a peach-pink thin silk outer garment with a purple lining, underneath an eight-panel white skirt with purple flowers and purple trim—very elegant attire. Only her hair wasn't styled according to Ming customs; instead, she wore a low, traditional-style hairdo commonly seen in period dramas.

Having finished dressing and grooming, she finally pulled a bell cord. Her personal maid Chunliu tiptoed in from outside the door. This girl had been bought by Guo Yi from the human market a few months ago. Because she was quite pretty, she'd nearly fallen into a brothel madam's hands. Also because she was outstanding-looking and "clever and quick-witted," she'd been assigned to an intelligence training class. She'd recently been transferred back from Lingao to serve as Pei Lixiu's personal maid and secretary.

According to Political Security General Administration regulations, all maids, servants, stewards, and other personal attendants at the Guangzhou Station had been completely replaced by transfers from the quarantine camps in Lingao. Previous personnel had been recalled to Lingao in batches for political vetting. Only after being confirmed honest and reliable could they return to serve in Guangzhou. Personnel deemed to have potential were temporarily enrolled in various short training courses to learn specialized skills. Sun Chang, for example, had studied administrative and personnel management in Lingao. The Guangzhou Station's indigenous personnel hadn't yet been absorbed into Lingao's indigenous personnel system, but the Civil Affairs Commission was already preparing their personal files.

The concubines of people like Guo Yi didn't enjoy such treatment. They were merely thoroughly vetted and, once confirmed to pose no danger, were allowed to remain. They had no place in the future indigenous personnel system.

Chunliu brought her mistress breakfast. On the lacquered tray was only a bowl of white congee and four small dishes of side dishes. Though it was already noon, she still prepared it as breakfast. This mistress seemed to have a certain fear of food, scrutinizing every morsel and gram.

Chunliu smiled and curtsied: "Madam, you're awake. Did you sleep well?"

Pei Lixiu didn't answer. She was staring at the rosewood writing desk by the window. Someone had placed a sheet of *Xuetao* paper there without her noticing.

The *Xuetao* paper didn't contain poetry—no one here exchanged verses with her; everyone knew Miss Pei didn't understand such things. The *Xuetao* paper contained her schedule for the day.

"Xiahe came in?" Pei Lixiu still had some "morning grumpiness" and asked irritably.

"How would she dare?" Chunliu said carefully. "It was delivered last night before you retired. Perhaps you didn't see it because it was dark."

The schedule was written by Xiahe, who managed documents and correspondence, and delivered every evening. Xiahe was also newly transferred from Lingao. She'd originally been the only daughter of a xiucai. A bandit raid had left her parents dead, and relatives in the clan had pressured her to sell herself to pay for the burials. That's how she'd ended up in the Guangzhou Station's hands. After quarantine in Lingao, because she was fairly literate, she'd been enrolled in the executive secretary training class. This time she'd been transferred back to Guangzhou specifically to serve as Pei Lixiu's secretary. Pei Lixiu's handwriting wasn't just unfit for refined occasions—it was even somewhat embarrassing to show people. Xiahe specifically wrote letters and invitations for her, and when necessary also translated overly literary letters. The executive secretary training class now also included some accounting knowledge, so Xiahe also served as Pei Lixiu's cashier. When visiting clients outside, Xiahe accompanied her to prevent Pei Lixiu from committing any breaches of etiquette.

"Send her in."

Because of her heavy responsibilities and role, people at the Guangzhou Station jokingly called her "brush-wielding maid." Others called her "head clerk maid of Zhiming Tower."

Xiahe wasn't pretty—she was even a bit coarse-handed and big-footed. Her father had only been a poor rural *xiucai*. She carefully walked into the room, properly gathered her skirts, gave a curtsy, and paid her respects to her mistress.

"You don't need to be so formal. What's happening today?"

Xiahe began explaining the day's schedule.

Pei Lixiu's days were mostly spent socializing. She socialized not just with Zhiming Tower's guests, but also with important people connected to the entire Guangzhou Station in various ways. These families' weddings, funerals, taking of concubines, birthday celebrations—each had to be handled according to the closeness of the relationship, preparing appropriate gifts, either visiting in person or sending someone. This was originally one of the primary duties of a lady of a prominent household.

Guo Yi had no formal wife. Since Pei Lixiu bore the title of his concubine, all these matters naturally fell to her to handle.

In the past, the Guangzhou Station's social circle had been limited, so there'd been little need to attend to such matters. Now it had become a heavy burden for Pei Lixiu. Every few days, some matter of etiquette inevitably awaited her attention.

...

"The third young master of the Nanhai County Magistrate has enrolled in school at the ancestral home. We should prepare a congratulatory gift."

"A concubine of Prefect Qiu has died. We need to send condolence money."

"The Zhou family of the Circuit Intendant is holding a Daoist ceremony on the eighth. We should attend."

"The Liu family has suffered a fire. We should send someone to offer condolences."
