# Chapter 632 - The General (Part One)

Wu Mu looked at the copied official documents just delivered. These had just been sent over from the postal inspection station set up at the Guanrong Post.

Although the entire territory of Lingao had long been under their control, to maintain the policy of "Ming on the outside, Australia on the inside," the postal roads were kept open at all times. After Shan Daoqian arrived at the Transportation Department, he not only repaired the postal roads but also took over the post stations along the way, restoring the crumbling buildings and ensuring the livelihood of the destitute courier soldiers. Therefore, fast horses carrying various official government documents still galloped unimpeded along this postal road. This gave the Political Security Bureau a great opportunity to spy on the movements of the government offices across the island. Zhao Manxiong had specifically set up a postal inspection office at the Guanrong Post, which was closest to Lingao. All official documents passing through Lingao were first opened and copied before being resealed and sent on.

Of course, Ming Dynasty official documents had seals and wax, and important documents were stitched and sealed, but these were not difficult problems for the transmigrators. Whether using special tweezers to roll out letters, using steam jets to melt paste, or even forging government seals, there were people who could do it—and even if no one could, they could always look up how to do it in the database.

They could see not only documents sent to Lingao County at any time, but also copy all passing government documents and send them to the Political Security Bureau. Now, a copy was also sent to the Foreign Intelligence Bureau.

These documents were routinely reviewed by Wu Mu. Although most documents were written in the vernacular of the time, they contained many official terms, and ancient vernacular was different from modern Mandarin after all. It was hard for modern people to fully understand, so he had a team of advisors made up of clerks from the county yamen specifically to explain the specific meanings in the documents to him.

Most documents had little value; they were mostly routine administrative correspondence between counties, with more than ninety percent concerning taxation and criminal case dispositions. This might be excellent first-hand material for someone aiming to research Ming history, but it was meaningless to Wu Mu.

Correspondence between the Lingao County Yamen and Qiongzhou Prefecture was the focus of their monitoring, especially whether Wu Mingjin and his subordinates were privately reporting Lingao's actual situation to the prefecture. Therefore, both official documents and private letters were subject to the strictest inspection.

Recently, the situation had become tense, and the volume of passing documents had increased. Wu Mu was very surprised to find that documents sent to Danzhou, Changhua, and other places continued to be passed down station by station through Lingao. It seemed they didn't care at all whether the documents could pass through the "bandit zone."

The Political Security Bureau and the Intelligence Bureau easily learned from the passing documents that the Ming army had no plan to send troops from Danzhou—the documents only ordered the locality to prepare grain to await shipment to Lingao, with no instructions for the Danzhou garrison to assemble and prepare for deployment, nor any orders for the garrison to immediately steam and wash their firearms for readiness.

He opened and read a few, finding nothing special. When he opened another one, his eyes suddenly widened.

It was an official document summoning Wu Mingjin to immediately report to the provincial capital for debriefing.

A copy of this letter immediately reached Xiong Buyou's hands. Then it reached the Executive Committee, and ten minutes later, the Field Army Headquarters at Maniao also received the news.

"Of course we can't let Wu Mingjin go to the provincial capital." Xiong Buyou stated his attitude simply and clearly. "First, if he goes to the provincial capital, he will likely tell everything. Even if he doesn't tell everything, he holds a large amount of first-hand information, and revealing even some of it would be bad. Second, this person is still useful in our hands. If he goes to the provincial capital, regardless of whether he lives or dies, we can no longer utilize him."

"It's easy to forbid him from going, but if we continue the Lingao model later, I'm afraid he won't be able to stay an official after openly disobeying an order." Wu De was worried about this issue.

"It doesn't matter, just have him send a distress document," Xiong Buyou said. "Isn't He Ming sending small units to harass Chengmai and Qiongshan? Let's add some more fuel. Say the Hair Thieves are besieging the county seat, and he is doing his utmost to defend and cannot leave the city."

"Will that work?"

"Master Wang can handle it."

Inside the county yamen, Wu Mingjin and others were in a state of extreme depression. The news that the government army was coming to Lingao to suppress the bandits was known in the yamen. Although the yamen runners had either been replaced or dared not contact him privately anymore, the inner yamen staff were his personal family servants, so he could still hear outside news from them.

The news started as rumors, but then became more and more solid. News from everywhere indicated that the Governor-General's troop deployment for suppression was imminent. Servants told him that the Australians were mobilizing troops, roads were full of soldiers and cannons, and ships in the harbor were also moving. moreover, rumors said Australia had sent new troops preparing for a fight to the death with the Great Ming.

Wu Mingjin's heart was both conflicted and painful. He knew that a momentary thought back then prevented him from committing suicide or escaping alone to the prefectural city to raise the alarm. Now there was no way out. He could only share his fate with the Australians. If the Australians won, he, this dubious magistrate, could probably continue—though not necessarily as the Great Ming's Lingao Magistrate. Thinking of this, a wave of grief for his native country surged in his heart. However, if the Great Ming won and the Australians weighed anchor and left, he couldn't leave with them, abandoning his ancestors' graves to become an Australian! He could only stay and wait for death!

Thinking of this, he was almost sleepless at night. He knew very well that once the Great Ming recovered Lingao, they would absolutely not consider him a loyal minister "defending an isolated city." Not only would his life be lost and his reputation ruined, but even his family would be implicated. His wife and children were in Lingao; when the time came, they would likely all perish together.

Wu Mingjin spent more than ten days in such an extremely conflicted and complex state of mind. Xiong Buyou knew from the insider placed in the inner yamen that he was suffering internally and was worried he might suddenly commit suicide. According to the Executive Committee's wishes: Wu Mingjin was to be protected as a priority, so the insider among the servants around him was instructed to watch the magistrate closely to prevent suicide. Additionally, You Guotuan was ordered to strengthen security at the inner yamen and the county gates to prevent him from escaping or privately sending people to deliver letters.

Xiong Buyou decided to discuss this matter with Wang Zhaomin—after all, the magistrate's seal was still in Wu Mingjin's hands. It was inconvenient for him to seize it by force. Although Master Wang had lost power, he had become a senior consultant to the Administration Council and was not dissatisfied with such a life. He had no official degree nor ate the Great Ming's salary, and now held double allowances from the magistrate and the Australians, keeping a concubine and living comfortably. He only hoped to muddle through peacefully until Master Wu left office.

Wang Zhaomin knew the news of the impending Ming army suppression earlier. But he didn't think the Australians would be defeated. Unlike Wu Mingjin, he often dealt with Australians and had been to many places, knowing the Australians' strength was extremely strong. The Ming army's encirclement and suppression would inevitably end in failure.

The biggest unfavorable consequence of this suppression was that his employer's position as Lingao Magistrate probably wouldn't be kept. But this had little relation to his own vital interests—he, Wang Zhaomin, could simply find another employer to continue being a master advisor.

Xiong Buyou consulted him and showed him the official document. Wang Zhaomin agreed with the judgment that Wu Mingjin could not go to the provincial capital to report, and also held a positive attitude towards the method of sending someone to raise the alarm.

"There is actually no need to let Master Wu know about this matter—he is currently alarmed and uneasy; bothering him further will only make Master Wu more embarrassed," Wang Zhaomin adhered to the consistent style of master advisors: reckless acting. "The seal is right in the signing room. Signing and stamping was originally my duty; I will handle this matter."

"Good. Then we rely on Master Wang's brilliant pen."

Wang Zhaomin immediately began writing this distress document. He wrote this document with great care. Although he knew nothing about the situation in Guangdong, judging from the order for Wu Mingjin to return to the province, official circles in Guangdong were not very clear about the situation in Lingao, and knew almost nothing about the Australians' situation.

However, the fact that Australians had been in Lingao for three years could not be hidden—Wu Mingjin had sent quite a few distress documents to the prefectural city back then, and Guangdong would definitely consult those original garrison reorts now.

It was hard to explain perfectly why the local county yamen had taken no countermeasures regarding the Australians being in Lingao for three years, especially now when "suppression" was the priority. Any justification would be nitpicked. Only when public opinion turned to "pacification" would contradictory statements not matter.

After thinking it over repeatedly, since it was hard to lie perfectly, better not to lie at all. Just send an extremely urgent letter saying Lingao was currently besieged by Hair Thieves, who were setting up cannons and building cloud ladders outside to storm the county city. The magistrate was urging the whole city's army and people to defend to the death, etc.

After writing, he circled and edited it again until satisfied. Then he copied it cleanly and stamped it, handing it to Xiong Buyou for review.

"It will take some trouble to find the person to deliver this letter," Master Wang said, stroking his beard. "Although the document only needs to be delivered to the prefectural city, in case the Prefect or Regional Commander Tang asks about the county's situation, we need someone eloquent and unafraid of death."

"This is no obstacle; I have my own candidate."

Xiong Buyou took the document and didn't return to his office, but went directly to the Political Security Bureau office. After repeatedly studying the letter with Wu Mu, Li Yan, and others and deciding there were no problems, they called a locally born indigenous intelligence officer studying in Class A of the Intelligence Training Center and had him deliver the letter to the prefectural city.

Li Yan instructed him one by one on how to answer if questioned. He also told him the potential dangers he might encounter and asked him to proceed with caution.

The news that Hair Thieves broke the Lingao Wei-Suo garrisons, harassed Chengmai, and besieged Lingao County City finally reached the Governor-General's Yamen in Zhaoqing via Hainan's express garrison report. Wang Zunde was already unhappy about failing to capture the Hair Thieves in Guangzhou. Now hearing that Lingao's Hair Thieves had broken local garrisons, besieged Lingao and Chengmai county cities, and harassed the region wantonly, he became even more furious. He strictly ordered He Rubin to assemble troops as soon as possible and cross the sea quickly for suppression. To supervise He Rubin's combat operations, Wang Zunde appointed Hainan Sub-prefectural Magistrate Zhao Ruyi as Supervising Censor. Then, he appointed Lu Yizhong as a Military Advisor in his army with the rank of Expectant Intendant.

Thus, He Rubin had two "supervisors" before he even moved. Leaving Zhao Ruyi aside as he was in Qiongshan County and couldn't leave his post unauthorized, this Lu Yizhong was a confidant from the Governor-General's staff. He came here originally to urge war, and inevitably gesticulated in the army often, demanding he "send troops quickly."

Lu Yizhong extorted various shops in Guangzhou City that usually traded with Australians, using bluff and intimidation to finally raise forty to fifty thousand taels of silver. Even the Gao family had to take out several thousand taels to send him off. Although this figure couldn't satisfy Wang Zunde, it at least salvaged a bit of trust.

While sternly urging the grand army to go to war, Wang Zunde stepped up the collection of fodder, gunpowder, and armor, preparing to ship them from Guangzhou to Qiongshan for storage.

The summer sun was scorching, but gusts of cool wind blew by the seaside. Although this was still the inner Pearl River, the river surface was broad, and wind and waves were as big as on the sea. Waves rose and fell, incessantly rushing toward the shore, crashing against the beach and reefs.

Because of Governor-General Wang Zunde's order, ships were banned from entering or leaving the Pearl River estuary. Moreover, merchant ships knew the government was currently commandeering large ships at the estuary, so they dared not appear here. Thus, there were only a few fishing boats and patrolling naval warships on the river surface.

In the river bay before Humen Stockade, many ships were concentrated, masts like a forest. There were ships of the Guangdong Navy as well as temporarily commandeered civilian vessels. Some large ships were fully loaded with grain and military ordnance, their white sails full, sailing west toward Hainan Island.

On the open ground in front of Humen Stockade, many military tents had been erected like scattered stars. Flags covered the wilderness; swords and spears stood like a forest. Drums and horns echoed each other. The military appearance was very majestic.

On the Yaniangxie Battery opposite Humen Stockade, flags fluttered. That was one of the main batteries on Guangzhou's periphery. Earth stockades, arrow towers, and blockhouses were built all around, garrisoned by many Ming troops, with flags flying in the wind.

He Rubin, accompanied by a group of subordinate generals, staff, and personal guards, stood on horseback by the river, ignoring the grand army assembled from the whole province. Since expelling the Red Hairs from Penghu in the late Tianqi years, Guangdong Province had never assembled such a large army. To supply this army, besides using the grain accumulated over years in government granaries on Hainan Island, large amounts of grain had to be transported additionally. Knowing the Hair Thieves had sharp firearms and preparing for a long siege, many newly cast cannons and firelocks were transported from Foshan. Also plenty of gunpowder. In a leeward, sunny spot behind Yaniangxie Mountain, a new gunpowder workshop was set up. Saltpeter, sulfur, and willow charcoal transported continuously from all over the province were made into gunpowder here.

"With elite soldiers and sufficient provisions, Your Excellency will surely achieve total victory in one battle this time." A staff officer flattered him.

"According to reports: The Hair Thieves' morale has not declined; not only do they show no intent to retreat, but they broke our garrisons and besieged our Lingao and Chengmai counties. It seems a fierce battle is inevitable to determine victory or defeat. Warfare is dangerous; there cannot be the slightest negligence." He Rubin was very surprised by the Hair Thieves' sudden activity. Since the Hair Thieves had lived quietly in Lingao for over three years, why attack everywhere suddenly now? Could it really be as Lu Yizhong said, just to retaliate for the government seizing the Australian factory?

He vaguely felt this matter wasn't so simple.

A middle-aged civil official stood on horseback nearby. He was Lu Yizhong, sent by Wang Zunde with the rank of Expectant Intendant to serve as Military Advisor before He Rubin's army. Although he came with the title of Military Advisor, everyone knew this was the supervisor sent by Wang Zunde.

The formal supervisor, Hainan Sub-prefectural Magistrate Zhao Ruyi, was still in Qiongshan County; he wouldn't run to Guangzhou to dictate things. Lu Yizhong wasn't so easy to dismiss. Not long after arriving in the army, he constantly urged He Rubin to cross the sea to Hainan as soon as possible.

Hearing He Rubin's words, Lu Yizhong quickly followed up: "The Commander speaks very truly. The Hair Thieves know their doomsday is approaching; like a cornered rat biting back, our army can only deter such petty villains by crossing the sea quickly."

Everyone knew Advisor Lu was urging advance again. In reality, the suppression army, claimed to be fifty thousand but actually twenty thousand, had only assembled over ten thousand men so far. This was already faster because troops were transferred from within the province. According to Ming and Qing custom, mobilizing and assembling so many troops couldn't be done all at once, as localities couldn't provide food and lodging for so many men and horses at one time. So troop units departed daily in "lifts" of two or three hundred men. Since they were going to fight and not on vacation, soldiers and officers naturally walked as slowly as possible, not even covering twenty li a day. Taking three or four months for tens of thousands of troops to assemble was perfectly normal.

At this speed, it would take another half month for the whole army to finish assembling. And the troops were cobbled together temporarily; although nominally under He Rubin's control, he wasn't familiar with all these generals scattered across the province under his command.

Unfamiliarity between general and soldiers is a great taboo in war. He Rubin originally wanted to assemble the whole army in Guangzhou, use the leisure of Hainan's rainy season and subsequent typhoon weather to review and train for a month or two locally, and then send troops in early autumn. But Lu Yizhong's constant urging forced him to send grain, armor, and his Town Headquarters Central Battalion across the sea first.

"The wind and waves are huge today!" He Rubin watched the fleet sailing away with sails spread. He couldn't help worrying about the fleet's safety. Several ships transporting grain and armor to Hainan had capsized a few days ago, losing much material.

"Rest assured, Your Excellency. These sailors are accustomed to sailing, and they use large local ships commandeered by the government, capable of sailing the Western Ocean. Going to Qiongshan will definitely be no problem," a staff officer comforted him.

Returning to the main camp, He Rubin discussed march strategy with his staff. The Governor-General was anxious for him to cross the sea and fight; besides eagerness for success, there was also the issue of exhausting troops and wasting pay. With this twenty thousand-strong army not yet fully assembled, the Guangdong Provincial Treasury had already spent over a hundred thousand taels of silver, not counting expenses for grain, ships, and firearms. Once at Lingao, besieging the Hair Thieves for months would cost even more.

For this, he had to make a gesture first, letting his most reliable troops cross the sea first.

Watching the first batch of crossing troops leave, He Rubin seemed to heave a sigh of relief—at least he had room to make excuses to the Governor-General. But great anxiety arose in his heart. He knew very little about the Hair Thieves' condition. He originally wanted to inquire face-to-face after the Lingao Magistrate arrived, but unexpectedly the Hair Thieves suddenly besieged the county city, trapping the magistrate so he couldn't rush to the provincial capital.
