# Chapter 739 - The Treaty of Macau

With Salt Licenses as collateral, Gao Ju summoned the city's wealthy merchants—Foreign, Salt, and Chaozhou merchants—to split the loan by head count. Although the interest wasn't high, the Salt License collateral meant zero risk of loss. The 400,000 taels were quickly fully subscribed. Gao Ju bragged a bit, raising his prestige among Guangzhou merchants.

News that Gao Ju raised the Ransom Fee via loans quickly spread through Meng Xian's channels. Delong Bank, as one of Guangzhou's largest exchange banks, also lent 5,000 taels to the "Ransom Fee" in this collective loan.

Gao Ju collected the silver. Aside from 300,000 taels sent by Li Fengjie in batches to the Australian camp outside the city, Gao Ju followed his own plan for the remaining 100,000: depositing 30,000 taels into Delong Bank, and having Delong issue a bank draft to Governor Li.

Chests of silver were checked and loaded onto ships in the military camp—this hard currency would greatly alleviate Lingao's current shortage of precious metal reserves.

Gao Ju personally visited the camp outside the city several times, gifting Wen Desi and others large quantities of presents and sheep and wine for rewarding the troops. This time his attitude toward the Australians was even more respectful. They were not only wealthy and capable tycoons but also bandits armed to the teeth. Fortunately, they were also merchants who kept promises. As business partners, Australians were exemplary.

Gao Ju was happy to maintain good cooperation with the Australians. Besides Eunuch Yang, the Australians could become a formidable backer—and compared to the insatiable Eunuch Yang, the Australians were clearly the "everyone gets rich" type who shared benefits.

The gifts Gao Ju presented were high in value, mostly luxury and enjoyment items of this era. Wen Desi was very satisfied, ordering everything accepted. Hearing Gao Ju's heap of flattery, the two sides discussed future cooperation of "wider scope" and "deeper depth." Gao Ju readily agreed to provide the Beijing political and commercial channels he had previously been hesitant to offer.

On the last visit, He Chengzong accompanied him. Both sides reached an agreement to launch the second phase of negotiations in Macau. According to Li Fengjie's wish, the Macau negotiations would be handled specifically by Li Luoyou. As for the time of the Australians' return to Guangzhou, Li Fengjie requested mid-December—after the current turmoil subsided slightly.

Subsequently, Wen Desi and others hosted a banquet for Gao Ju and He Chengzong at the Vihara. Cups were exchanged, toasts raised repeatedly, and gifts presented—including valuable Australian goods for Li Fengjie and others. Guests and hosts dispersed happily.

With the Ransom Fee paid, the Task Force had no need to stay outside the city. After Chen Haiyang and others collected some "Reasonable Burden" outside the city to fully demonstrate their prestige, they chose a day to withdraw from the Provincial River.

On November 20, the Task Force fired a 24-gun salute. The whole army boarded ships and left the camp. The Task Force arrived at Humen that night, rendezvousing with the Humen garrison. Most facilities here had been dismantled, materials transported to Hong Kong, leaving only 2 Special Service Boat squadrons and 1 Marine company to continue garrisoning—this was a chip reserved for future negotiations with the Guangdong local government. After resting one night, Chen Haiyang and others led the fleet out of Humen anchorage. At noon on the 21st, passing Macau and Modaoyang, they entered Victoria Harbour, finally anchoring at Central Anchorage. The two-month "Pearl River Basin Punitive Operation" was declared over.

During these two-plus months, construction of Base 852 in Hong Kong expanded rapidly—large numbers of captives filled the labor force. When Chen Haiyang returned to Base 852, several outposts and batteries covering Hong Kong's surrounding waterway entrances had been completed. The first main road near Central was under intense construction. This road roughly followed the coastline. Hong Kong's first wharves, warehouses, and trading houses would be developed along this road.

Because negotiations hadn't officially ended, the Military Affairs General Court telegraphed the Task Force to rest and reorganize in Hong Kong. Some ships needing repair could return to Lingao; other ships and personnel remained on standby. Once negotiations broke down, they would re-enter the Pearl River for combat.

Li Luoyou watched the Australian fleet sail out of the Pearl River Estuary escorted by black-smoke-spewing small boats. He knew the situation was settled—the urgent task now was cleaning up the mess. Sure enough, orders soon came from Guangzhou to immediately start negotiations with the Australians.

Li Luoyou felt both resistance and anticipation toward these negotiations. Anticipation because after this negotiation, trade could resume, and normal life on both sides of the Pearl River would return to track. Whether for his personal interest or the people's interest, signing a peace treaty with the Australians had significant meaning.

The resistance came from knowing the Australians' reckless behavior in the Pearl River over the past two months. Government troops once again displayed absolute incompetence. With dozens of ships and one or two thousand men, the Australians rampaged through the Pearl River banks like entering no-man's-land, extorting "Reasonable Burden" everywhere, killing many local gentry, taking thousands of captives, and looting massive amounts of wealth.

The Australians' actions were like another Jianzhou Jurchen. Of course, they were more polite to commoners than the beast-like Jurchens, not arresting people randomly or engaging in widespread looting, arson, and killing. They were only ruthless toward resistors. Li Luoyou keenly realized the Australians were much smarter than the Jurchens, and also much more dangerous.

The negotiation location was chosen at Huang Shunlong's private residence. Huang Shunlong felt honored to serve both Grand Shopkeeper Li and the Australians simultaneously, vacating his best courtyard for their use.

The negotiation representative sent from Lingao was Si Kaide (Scad), Director of the Colonial and Trade Ministry. This "Pro-Peace Party" member had always advocated negotiating peace with the Ming or even accepting amnesty quickly. This time the Executive Committee agreed to his negotiating peace, but forbade any "Amnesty Acceptance."

Besides the conditions already agreed upon under Guangzhou's walls (returning Purple Enterprise property, compensation, reopening bilateral trade, etc.), Si Kaide presented six requirements:

1.  Australians may freely buy and hire population, and dispose of or transport population externally without government interference.
2.  All ships under Australian names entering Guangzhou for trade shall not pay tax. Cargo on board shall be exempt from "Chou Fen" (tariff).
3.  Purple Enterprise and other Australian industrial/commercial enterprises shall continue paying official commercial taxes, but all corrupt customary fees ("Loud Gu") are waived.
4.  Australians enjoy extraterritoriality in Guangzhou. Any arrest, detention, or interrogation involving Australians requires Australian consent.
5.  Australians may freely buy land and build houses in Guangzhou.
6.  Hong Kong Island and surrounding outlying islands shall be controlled by Australians. Australians allowed to act freely thereon.

Si Kaide finished reading the six articles. Li Luoyou felt slightly relieved—no terrible indemnities or annual tributes. Due to the lessons of the two Song Dynasties, the Ming had great vigilance against such things. But the last article caught his attention: did "control" mean ceding Hong Kong Island?

In Ming history, Xiangshan Ao (Hong Kong) was far less famous than Haojing Ao (Macau). Even a merchant like Li Luoyou, doing business on the Guangdong coast for a long time, wasn't very familiar with it. But familiar or not, ceding land was absolutely impossible.

"Ceding Xiangshan Ao is absolutely impossible." Li Luoyou knew clearly that this obscure island was likely already in Australian hands. Their demand to add this to the negotiation was merely to legitimize it, confirming their power.

Si Kaide remained silent, continuing to listen to his statement.

"...This clause requiring cession of Hong Kong Island—let alone the Governor daring not agree, even the Emperor dares not mention the word 'Cede Land'," Li Luoyou said. "Furthermore, the Governor absolutely dares not memorialize this clause to the Court to reach Heaven's hearing."

Si Kaide remained silent. Yu Eshu of the Great Library had mentioned these issues when drafting terms—given the current state, having the Ming sign a treaty like the "Treaty of Nanjing" was systematically impossible. No Governor-General or Governor would dare sign such a document.

"Moreover, the Court has great wariness against overseas people. The debate between Sea Ban and Opening never ceases in court. You want to march into Guangzhou waving the Australian banner openly? Let alone the Governor can't cover the sky with one hand—there are several officials in the city who can memorialize directly to the Court—even if he could, what if the Guangdong Governor changes?"

Si Kaide was convinced: "What is your view, Sir?"

"This matter can only be known to you and me, absolutely never proclaimed to the world," Li Luoyou said.

Li Luoyou indicated that the Guangdong local government could only secretly agree to the Australian conditions. Both sides would "make fortunes in silence," absolutely never putting it into official documents, and certainly not raising the Australian banner brazenly.

The Ming government prohibited all foreigners from residing or trading in Guangzhou. Except for the Portuguese privilege of entering Guangzhou to trade twice a year, no foreigner could stay in Guangzhou. Australians naturally couldn't either.

If this right were forcibly demanded, even if Li Fengjie was willing to memorialize it, the wrangling in court would yield no result for three or four years.

"Fortunately, Australians are also descendants of Huaxia; your faces and appearances are no different from Ming people. Why not continue as Ming subjects?" Li Luoyou schemed: just pretend to be local natives in Guangzhou.

Once the identity issue was solved, everything could be resolved easily.

Since they were Guangzhou natives, buying land, building houses, trading people, and hiring workers were entirely at their discretion; the government would absolutely not interfere. As for large-scale population export, Li Luoyou believed that as long as the exported were refugees from elsewhere, the government would not only not obstruct but welcome it—otherwise, they could have obstructed Australian export of population from Guangzhou years ago.

As for the second article, ship tax: since Australians count as Guangzhou natives, and ship navigation is only between Lingao and Guangzhou—purely domestic coastal trade—naturally there's no need to pay "Chou Fen" and "Zhang Shui" required for overseas merchant ships and foreign vessels.

As for the third article, tax exemption: as long as a tacit agreement is reached with the government, it's not a problem—commercial taxes in the Ming were originally not high. As long as merchants had certain backing, local officials dared not extort too heavily, so paying tax was no pressure. Of course, some necessary customary bribes were unavoidable, but with the Australians' reputation for killing without blinking, probably no blind fool would want *that* money.

Regarding extraterritoriality and such request, Li Luoyou smiled bitterly: "You care about this? No one in all Guangzhou is blind enough to condemn you. You are now powerful gentry; one card sent into the Yamen can bail out even arsonist and murderer bandits."

Regarding Hong Kong Island, Li Luoyou firmly opposed their occupying it. He believed the Governor could absolutely not agree.

"The Governor can only turn a blind eye to this matter; he absolutely cannot allow you to lease this place like the Portuguese," Li Luoyou said. "This matter is no small trifle. The Portuguese entering Haojing Ao was a matter of time and luck, not to be forced."

After ten days of bargaining and telegram/letter exchanges between Guangzhou and Lingao, the two sides finally reached a principled agreement in Macau. Later known to history as the *Treaty of Macau*, the Empire's historical circles have great controversy over whether this agreement constitutes a true treaty. The mainstream view is that this treaty was merely a memorandum of understanding between the Empire and the Ming local government. The text was never formally signed or sealed, and the Ming copy was lost. Not a true international treaty, this document was only implemented in Guangdong thanks to the Empire's powerful force of strong ships and cannons.

Because the Guangdong government concluded this treaty privately, they naturally didn't file it publicly in the archives. it was stored as a top-secret private document in Li Luoyou's residence for reference. This text was long lost. According to the text preserved in the Great Library, the *Treaty of Macau* had eleven articles:

1.  Australians may freely travel to, reside, trade, and farm in Guangzhou and surrounding prefectures/counties controlled by the Guangdong Governor, carrying family and servants. However, they must pose as Guangdong natives and must not publicly call themselves Australians.
2.  All Australian affairs in Guangzhou are the responsibility of the Purple Enterprise Grand Shopkeeper. All commercial and civil disputes shall be handled by him with the government.
3.  All Australian industries in Guangzhou shaoll pay tax according to government regulations, but miscellaneous levies and customary fees are waived.
4.  Australians may buy land and real estate in Guangzhou.
5.  Australian ships entering Guangzhou for trade are exempt from all Water Pay, Tariffs, and Fees. However, they must pose as Ming ships and must not call themselves Australian ships. Otherwise, taxes and fees will not be waived.
6.  Australians may freely conduct any trade in Guangzhou and freely transport goods and silver in and out without government interference.
7.  Australians may freely hire and buy population in Guangzhou and freely take them to any location Australians wish.
8.  Guangdong government will not interfere with Australians repairing ships or staying in Xiangshan Ao (Hong Kong).
9.  All Australian industries, land, and businesses in Guangzhou, and property/goods previously seized, shall be returned. Since some goods were sold and equipment damaged, both sides agree to a one-time compensation of 30,000 Kuping Taels from Guangdong.
10. All Ming subjects implicated in the previous arrest of Australians shall not be infringed upon or arrested by the government. Those already arrested shall be released immediately. Property damages infringed upon them shall be compensated by a one-time government payment of 5,000 Kuping Taels.
11. After all compensation, release, and return work is completed, the Australian garrison at Humen will withdraw completely.

Besides the eleven articles, there were supplementary treaties and several agreements. Many details were personally drafted by Ma Jia (Ma Chia) of the Tribunal, the formatting very solemn.

Overall, the Executive Committee didn't value this treaty much, as it was basically a private agreement between the Senate and Li Fengjie. Its binding force on the Ming government was limited to Li Fengjie's tenure. Once Li Fengjie left office, the agreement would effectively expire.

However, the traditional characteristic of Chinese bureaucracy is the extreme inheritance of customary rules ("Loud Gui"). As long as this agreement operated smoothly for a few years, forming an interest group around it, a new Governor could only acquiesce helplessly. Furthermore, given current development momentum, how long Ming rule in Guangdong would last—or how many Governors would change—was unknown.

The reason this low-level memo was made detailed and solemn was mainly Ma Jia's intent to satisfy the Senate—giving Senators the satisfaction of signing an unequal treaty. In Ma Jia's view, the countless wealth and population brought back by the Task Force, plus the 300,000 tael Ransom Fee, outweighed any treaty.

Despite the treaty's limited significance, when the telegraph of the *Treaty of Macau* signing reached Lingao, the Senate still ordered a 24-gun salute and 1-minute whistle blast at Bopu to celebrate.

The Treaty of Macau didn't touch on the issue of He Rubin's remnants trapped in Qiongshan. Li Fengjie believed this matter had nothing to do with him; besides, no county in Qiongzhou Prefecture had reported falling, so he was happy to play deaf and mute.

The day after celebrating the *Treaty of Macau*, news came from Guangdong: Liangguang Governor-General Wang Zunde died of illness at his post in Zhaoqing. The Governor-General's seal would be temporarily cared for ("Hu Li") by Li Fengjie.

Thus, the task of cleaning up the Qiongshan mess and rescuing He Rubin's troops fell to Li Fengjie. Of course, he could continue playing deaf until a new Governor-General arrived. But Li Fengjie harbored a hope: hoping to turn "Caring For" into "Acting For" ("Shu Li"), and finally "Direct Regularization." To this end, he sent fast horses to the Capital for lobbying, while sending Li Luoyou to Lingao again, striving to reach an agreement with Australians quickly regarding the rescue of He Rubin's remnants.
