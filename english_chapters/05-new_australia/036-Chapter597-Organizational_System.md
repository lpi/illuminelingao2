# Chapter 597 - Organizational System

In a few months, Lin Baiguang intensified infiltration activities against various yamens in Qiongzhou Prefecture through Ma Benyuan's local relationship and utilizing the Gou family ledger in hand for blackmail, quickly infiltrating most yamens. Not only did established a network of relationships targeting middle and lower-level figures like private advisors, clerks, and yamen runners, but also successfully bribed servants of several main local officials. Now he could know what book the Prefect of Qiongzhou read yesterday the next day if needed.

"The reason I say we need to increase manpower investment in this place is not to add standing intelligence personnel. We already have strong strength in this place, with enough energy to ensure the safety of inexperienced newcomers operating here—use Qiongshan County as an internship ground for intelligence personnel."

This idea was novel enough. Jiang Shan thought, "Internship in a relatively safe 'enemy-occupied area'?"

"Correct," Lin Baiguang nodded. "Qiongshan County is a microcosm of Ming local society. Although slightly inferior in prosperity, the operation of the government and social forms are very representative. The experience our intelligence personnel, whether Elder or indigenous, gain from activities here will be more useful than internships in places like East Gate Market. At least they will have the tension of operating in enemy territory."

"Can safety be guaranteed?"

"Absolutely." Lin Baiguang guaranteed, "If anyone gets caught, I have ways to get him out—of course, it will cost some money."

"Good, I've noted this matter."

He continued: "I am actively training two indigenous intelligence personnel, originally hoping to select one to replace my work in Qiongshan. But recently I discovered it's presumably very hard—they are too young, needing five or six years to reach twenty. Not that their ability isn't enough, but in Great Ming, a person's age is a key issue for carrying out social activities." He coughed, "Overly young people are hard to gain sufficient respect and trust. Easily looked down upon. Of course, if planting them into the lower class society, this doesn't matter. If using identities like merchants or other professions contacting the government and gentry, age is best above twenty-five or twenty-six. I hope the Bureau will pay attention when selecting the new batch of indigenous intelligence trainees."

"So that's how it is." Jiang Shan nodded thoughtfully. He recalled the files of the graduated indigenous intelligence personnel training class he saw—all under twenty without exception.

Chen Tianxiong had been silent, but interjected now: "Running several training classes, all training teenagers, what use is this? Just constantly demanding loyalty, but loyalty alone can't do things."

Teenage boys and girls generally could only handle office work; sent outside they could only handle some simple errand-running and inquiring tasks. This was very detrimental to launching large-scale activities.

"Also, intelligence training should have focus, and must have certain skills." Chen Tianxiong added, "I looked at their training materials, actually similar to the General Bureau of Political Security's training content—many illegal activity techniques—completely unnecessary. Why kind of intelligence personnel do we need? Nothing more than being able to accurately report enemy movement, quantity, local social sentiment, economic status. 90% of these contents are open intelligence, just need to spend a bit more effort to collect and organize, no need for great trouble to learn tracking, kidnapping, arson and such things—this is not collecting intelligence, it's intelligence warfare.

"My requirement for indigenous intelligence personnel is: they only need to master basic intelligence collection skills. Must know how to count, recognize a few characters. Best if able to write reports; if not, being able to accurately elaborate what is seen and heard is enough. Then teach some simple secret work skills; nothing else is needed. And no need for them to be utterly loyal and long-tested. Adopting suitable secrecy and organizational systems can ensure that even if they are caught or defect, they won't affect the big picture—low-level intelligence personnel can totally be trained as consumables."

"Also should teach some cover and survival skills." Lin Baiguang added, "Knowing one or two trades, or knowing chanting sutras and fortune telling and the like, so intelligence personnel can use professions as cover for mobility."

"Of course, we can also train some high-level talents specifically. But I oppose directly training high-level intelligence personnel—this system of so-called direct training of intelligence elites is unfeasible. We should select outstanding elements from ordinary intelligence personnel who have worked for some time for continuing education." Chen Tianxiong continued to elaborate his intelligence personnel education theory.

Such suggestions counted as constructive. Listening to the thoughts of front-line personnel was indeed very useful. Jiang Shan nodded secretly. He had thought of some points among them, but hadn't formed a system. Now these two spoke much more comprehensively and systematically than him.

"Alright, in the future we will train intelligence personnel according to this plan." Jiang Shan immediately affirmed their suggestions. "Listening to you say this, the line of thought is much more vivid. The comrades on the front line indeed consider things comprehensively."

"Kind words, kind words." Lin Baiguang said very politely.

Seeing the meeting atmosphere become relatively harmonious, Jiang Shan then said: "Regarding the launch of intelligence work, my thinking is this:

"We divide intelligence work into two major categories. The first category is collecting and compiling stability information of various regions that can be purposeful, planned, and easy to file for reference. For example, map surveying, traffic investigation, logistics economic situation analysis, products, manpower, political composition and diplomatic tendency, historical evolution, copies of gazettes and extracts of important publications, long-term garrison situation, overview of public and large military facilities... etc., etc."

"Archived in the Master Intelligence Database?" Wang Ding drew a few lines in his notebook.

"Yes. Sources of this intelligence can rely on various departments, including institutions like overseas stations, or dispatch specialized personnel to these places for on-site investigation under the name of doing business, studying, or wandering. Given the slow development speed of ancient society, data obtained from one investigation might not need correction for over a decade."

"This is too exaggerated—" Lin Baiguang shook his head, "Verifying once a year or two is still necessary, especially for traffic conditions and people's sentiment. Now is not a peaceful time; the seventeen years of the Chongzhen reign are basically an era of gradual chaos. Society changes very fast."

"Roughly that meaning." Jiang Shan decided not to entangle in details with him, speaking on directly, "These data are very useful not only to military departments but also to economic and industrial departments. Can open queries according to security levels, including indigenous cadres within the system can also query. Such intelligence can be obtained and transmitted through open and semi-open methods, different from other intelligence work implementation methods. We also don't need to invest too many professional personnel; we can adopt a government-supervised merchant-managed system."

Jiang Shan's so-called government-supervised merchant-managed system was similar to the model of Guangzhou Station cultivating Qiwie Escort Agency, opening various enterprises along traffic arteries and important towns. Most staff could be recruited locally instead of dispatched from Lingao, only dispatching a few intelligence personnel among them to carry out work.

"Such enterprises can also provide logistics support, goods flow, and traffic lines for intelligence personnel. Killing many birds with one stone." Jiang Shan said, "At the same time, the enterprise's own operation guarantees no need to invest too much funding support. We only need to spend startup costs, then let it maintain itself relying on the enterprise's own profits."

"This is a memo I found in the materials transferred from the former Intelligence Resources Committee archives," Wang Ding said, "Date sent is August 1629. Coincides with your thinking."

"Is that so, how come I didn't see it?" Jiang Shan expressed surprise.

"A few more boxes of materials were transferred yesterday," Wang Ding explained, "Let's look first."

To: Intelligence Resources Committee

From: Grand Library - Historical Data Research Group, First Class Historical Data Researcher: Yu E-shui

Subject: Yu E-shui's views on the intelligence system and evaluation of memo K/BW/290322.77.

...

Intelligence agencies need intelligence supplementary materials. Can reference Japan's continental Ronin actions. The Lingao organization actively dispatches Ronin groups enthusiastic and loyal to penetrate northward and southward actively, collecting intelligence by running schools, opening shops, and doing business.

This work is a very specific and huge spontaneous work, requiring strictly educated indigenous elites to spontaneously feel that dreams cannot be realized step-by-step within Lingao's existing system, only by taking the lead to act towards the vast continent can they ascend to heaven in one step...

...Can let the military, General Bureau of Political Security and other relevant departments participate jointly, and implement key leadership and business guidance work. But not interfere in specific business activities. This is a semi-open intelligence agency, can coordinate with other power departments, also an in-depth organization of collecting huge physical books and Ming Dynasty world materials by advisory agencies...

...

Foreign intelligence work entering powerful long-range reconnaissance actions too fast, I personally think is inappropriate... Special Reconnaissance Team's scale is insufficient to support such widespread actions... Collected by the intelligence system's public institutions, this kind of staff-ride style field investigation can totally be conducted.

...

Military Intelligence Bureau can establish two organizations... One is inland river/near-sea boat assassination teams, utilizing the advantage of silent close-combat weapons in the chaos of pirate river grain transport, making some enemy leaders die without a trace. Dutch Ghost Ships run everywhere; coastal cities with intelligence personnel and Ronin groups' reception can execute light decapitation to deter enemies; Second is adopting ultra-long-range reconnaissance training, target is to achieve light infantry squads being able to survive in the wilderness in South China mountains to the level of Discovery's Bear Grylls... That is hard probes of mountain infantry, Night Not Collected, targeting local armed forces like mountain bandits and water bandits. Regular army plain warfare doesn't need them; the future of these special armed forces is mainly used for suppression of guerrillas and local bandits...

...

Lin Baiguang nodded. He had an impression of this material, although not deep. But at that time the Intelligence Resources Committee had no distinct organization, and the General Bureau of Political Security was not very responsive in this aspect, so the matter was shelved like this.

"What is this Military Intelligence Bureau?" Jiang Shan became alert to this term. He realized the chaos of the intelligence system within the Transmigration Group just days after taking over. No wonder Lin Baiguang was uninterested in this, constantly wanting to go out for field duty.

"At that time the Army and Navy both proposed establishing a specialized Military Intelligence Bureau. Later someone specifically submitted a memo discussing the organizational structure of the Military Intelligence Bureau." Lin Baiguang said, "But this plan consumed too many resources, and the Executive Committee wasn't very interested. The matter was shelved. The second half of Yu E-shui's memo should be discussing this memo."

"And then?"

"No then." Lin Baiguang said, "This memo should still be in the archives of the Intelligence Resources Committee. You can find it to read."

Jiang Shan realized Lin Baiguang and Chen Tianxiong were unwilling to discuss this matter deeply, deciding to shelve this matter temporarily and talk about his "government-supervised merchant-managed" intelligence system.

"...Yu E-shui's thinking is broader than mine." Jiang Shan said, "According to his thinking, we can expand channels wider. Not necessarily needing to run enterprises or businesses, can also run religious facilities or schools."

"In this aspect we can cooperate deeply with the Religious Affairs Office." Wang Ding said, "Didn't Daoist Zhang state his position already?"

"Humph, if you want to cooperate with him, you have to help him apply for personnel—his biggest headache is this." Lin Baiguang smiled, "You really think Daoist Zhang cooperates sincerely, providing us free lunch."

Wang Ding said: "If you want people to exert effort, giving some benefits is heavenly principles and earthly justice, right."

"If his New Taoism can really be as strong as he boasts, I feel helping him apply for some personnel is deserved. Everyone benefits." Chen Tianxiong said, "People like monks and Taoists can scurry around openly everywhere; the government doesn't pay much attention. Spreading rumors is also their strength."

"As for this kind of dispatched intelligence agency, personally I think it is best not to form an open chain or branch model, to avoid one agency being exposed and the whole net being caught by implication." Jiang Shan said, on this point he had views on the Qiwie Escort Agency's big chain system. But better left unsaid. At this stage they still needed Qiwie's help. Later he prepared to gradually establish a system himself—or just like Yu E-shui said, a "Black Dragon Society" type.

"As for personnel management, we can borrow from the investigation net system Zhao Manxiong runs." Jiang Shan said. After the formal establishment of the Foreign Intelligence Bureau, Zhao Manxiong sent a memo briefing on the situation of the reconnaissance net set up by the General Bureau of Political Security in counties surrounding Lingao, and expressed this resource "could be shared in some way."

Although Jiang Shan was somewhat dissatisfied with this behavior, he had few soldiers and generals now, without a bit of performance, so he had to swallow his anger. Furthermore, the Executive Committee's instructions to him clearly stated: no need to invest too much energy in intelligence work on Hainan Island itself. And the PSB currently only deployed the reconnaissance net to a few counties near Lingao, not rolled out on a large scale. Arguing with the PSB on this was meaningless. Besides, in many aspects, he still had to rely on the PSB providing professional guidance and business cooperation. The organizational structure of this reconnaissance net was obtained from PSB Office Director Wu Mu, and the other party very enthusiastically expressed willingness to provide faculty support in intelligence personnel training.

The reconnaissance net sets up 1 reconnaissance instructor in each area, subordinating 2 to 4 reconnaissance groups. Every group has 3 people, 1 being the group leader. When developed to 5 people, it splits into two groups. No horizontal contact occurs between instructors, nor between group leaders. Vertical reporting and guidance by level is implemented. The reconnaissance instructor commands the reconnaissance work of the whole district, collecting reports from group leaders and feeding back intelligence via traffic stations.

Jiang Shan continued to talk about the "Second Category Work" in intelligence work. Namely adopting covert line operations, targeting confidential information and uncertain events, such as undercover agents infiltrating the enemy regime core. Their value is relatively high. Such covert line personnel adopt the traffic officer single-line model for direct contact. No contact happens with the local reconnaissance net.

"I personally feel deep sea sleeper agents have no value." Chen Tianxiong directly opposed without politeness, "It's at most a dozen years for us to overthrow Great Ming. Why bother with deep sleeper agents? Grasping what Chongzhen thinks or what he writes on memorials has little significance to us."

"At least we can grasp the opponent's strategic moves."

"I don't deny this, but the cost spent to reach this level compared to the benefit is really too disproportionate." Chen Tianxiong reminded Jiang Shan, "We know almost nothing about the Great Ming system. Transmigrators have no similarity to ancients. To infiltrate the enemy interior, and even mix into the high level and core, is simply fantastical. Even if some Elder goes crazy wanting to go undercover, I will oppose—this is sending themselves to die."

Lin Baiguang coughed: "Not to the extent of sending themselves to die. Infiltrating the enemy interior still has value. Of course mixing into the high level is probably unlikely. Personally I think: no need to deliberately seek opportunities to infiltrate the enemy interior, but don't give up if suitable opportunities arise. Having a few sleeper agents or relationships mixed into the enemy system is still useful." He reminded, "For instance our Tang Monk Plan. The preliminary preparation for this plan is already completed."

"The difficulty of the Tang Monk Plan lies in too many difficulties for a modern person to impersonate a Great Ming official. Equals re-educating and molding this person," Chen Tianxiong said, "In case of failure, losses are heavy."

"Is the Tang Monk Plan still being implemented?" Jiang Shan had seen this action plan in piles of files, containing rich collected materials. There were special topic reports on staff rides written by Bei Wei, various social surveys from Leizhou Station, but no follow-up.

"Theoretically speaking, the Tang Monk Plan was never cancelled," Chen Tianxiong said. "The problem is who goes to be the imposter bandit?"

"Yes, and according to the plan above, after the First Five-Year Plan ends, Leizhou will be in the bag. Going to impersonate this Prefect is a bit redundant."
