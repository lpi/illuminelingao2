# Chapter 661 - Oceanic Care

Medals were awarded on site. In addition to First, Second, and Third-Class Military Merit Medals for combat personnel, fifteen militia members received Second and Third-Class Merit Medals for their participation in battle.

All participants in the combat and logistics support—both military and civilian—received the First Counter-Encirclement Victory Commemorative Medal. Those who had fought at Chengmai or served in logistics there also received the "Chengmai Campaign Victory Commemorative Medal."

After the medal ceremony, the entire army conducted a march-past in battalion formations. To the strains of the *Grenadier's March*, the five battalions and militia marched past the earthen reviewing stand. Everyone cheered three times.

Following the military review, He Ming led all members of the delegation into the officers' small mess hall. This was where senior officers dined. The tables were covered with tablecloths, decorated with fresh flowers, and fitted with Venetian blinds over the windows. Large ice buckets stood in each corner and in the center of the room, exhaling wisps of cool white vapor. The moment one stepped inside, a sense of comfort descended.

Orderlies had prepared hot towels and cold tea.

"Not bad here." Wen Desi dropped into a seat, mopping sweat from his brow. Inspecting the troops might look majestic, but standing at attention in the sun in full dress, walking back and forth, maintaining the most dignified posture—it was no light task. Wen Desi recalled watching videos of Red Square parades, where Soviet leaders in their seventies and eighties would stand for hours in the freezing wind.

"This is the senior officers' mess—also our conference room." He Ming avoided using the term "transmigrator officers" in the barracks. He thought it unwise, with native officers growing more numerous, to constantly remind them of that distinction.

Soon the orderlies brought lunch—served in individual portions as in all transmigrator mess halls. Each person received a wooden tray with rice, vegetables, and soup.

The rice was brown rice. The dishes included vegetables, tempura prawns, stir-fried razor clams, seaweed and tofu soup, and finally, several fried meatballs. The aroma was tantalizing.

In the center of the table sat rectangular wooden platters filled with crushed ice, topped with rows of assorted sashimi.

"Everything's from the sea," Zhan Wuya sighed. "I keep feeling we're drifting toward Japanese food culture." He took four or five slices of sashimi.

The fishing industry in Ma'ao was quite developed. The Agricultural Committee had established a second fishery procurement and processing plant here, using local salt to process seafood. Recently, a large coal-gas cold storage facility had been built specifically to store fresh seafood, ensuring abundant supply.

There were also platters heaped with subtropical fruits—mainly jackfruit, followed by pineapples, bananas, and mangoes.

The beverages were coconut juice and kvass; no alcohol was served—except for kvass and the beer they hadn't yet begun producing.

"Meatballs today!" Seeing the fragrant fried balls, someone excitedly sprinkled pepper-salt and began eating, exclaiming appreciation between bites.

"Sausages, meatballs—things like that, you'd best not know what they're made of." Wen Desi murmured, eating one. The spices were strong, with a hint of beef flavor.

No doubt these were made from cattle and horses recovered from the battlefield. Though he hadn't been on the front lines, he had seen the spoils inventory. It clearly listed the number of dead oxen and horses captured—obviously repurposed to improve meals.

"What's the afternoon program?" Wang Luobin asked between bites.

Wen Desi said: "Distributing comfort packages—we don't need to do that ourselves. The packages are already at the warehouse; officers will hand them out by headcount. We need to visit the hospital for a morale visit."

"How many wounded?"

He Ping, representing the Health Department, said: "Very few of our own wounded require hospitalization—fewer than thirty. But there are nearly four hundred seriously wounded among the prisoners. The hospital is almost full."

"Give the prisoners some comfort items too—simpler stuff, of course. A dried fish each for their evening snack should do—you have dried fish here, right?"

"Yes, plenty," Dongmen Chuiyu said.

"We'll borrow four hundred dried fish first." Wen Desi thought a moment. "Have Pan Pan prepare the DV. Shoot plenty of footage this afternoon."

That afternoon, the hospital visit took place. Afterward, the *Lingao Times (Public Edition)* published an article titled *Oceanic Care*:

"After the grand parade celebrating our great regime's victory, the delegation dined simply in the Ma'ao base mess hall.

"All the ingredients were produced by the hands of the Fubogun cadres and soldiers here at Ma'ao. Comrades Wen Desi, Ma Qianzhu, Wang Luobin, Zhan Wuya, and other leaders savored the modest meal while praising the delicious food produced by the Fubogun in compliance with the Yuan Laoyuan's brilliant directive to 'launch production campaigns and lighten the people's burden.'

"During the meal, Chairman Wen asked with concern about the condition of the Fubogun wounded.

"'They are all stable,' General He replied. 'The wounded have received excellent care and are recovering.'

"Chairman Wen requested to visit the wounded that afternoon and distribute comfort items imbued with the deep affection of the Yuan Laoyuan and the people. General He said: 'You have already worked hard inspecting the troops this morning. Let other comrades handle the afternoon.'

"'We came here precisely to comfort the soldiers of the Fubogun. Compared to their arduous battles, what is a little exertion on our part this morning?' He laughed heartily. 'Let us finish our meal quickly and visit the wounded comrades soon, so as not to disturb their afternoon rest.'

"General He and everyone present were so moved by these words they could hardly speak. All felt proud to have such an approachable leader who, despite his busy schedule, cares for every ordinary soldier.

"The Ma'ao Army-Navy Hospital was peaceful and serene.

"This was a brand-new facility. The Engineering Company, renowned for speed and quality, had built it on barren ground in just three months. Now the hospital was equipped with the latest Australian medical equipment, staffed by carefully trained medical personnel.

"The wounded had just finished a nutritious lunch to speed their recovery and were preparing to rest when a voice came: 'The Yuan Laoyuan delegation has arrived!'

"Like spring rain upon parched earth, the wounded officers and soldiers, moved to their cores, struggled to sit up.

"'Don't get up—rest well.' Secretary of State Ma gently eased an excited wounded man back onto his pillow.

"He asked the medical staff how many wounded there were and the nature of their injuries.

"After receiving answers, he surveyed the ward—this room that embodied his deep concern. The proposal to build the Ma'ao Army-Navy Hospital had been championed by Secretary Ma himself, who had personally marked and revised the design drawings.

"He looked around the room, smiling with satisfaction: 'The beds are well-appointed—they've even added folding tray tables.'

"He carefully examined a bedside tray table.

"Sometimes he bent to look closer, sometimes stepped back to observe. Suddenly he asked: didn't the table seem a bit high?

"The medical staff, having not noticed this detail, could not immediately answer. He turned to a nearly recovered patient: 'Is the table comfortable to use?'

"The soldier sat up, rested both arms on the table, and shifted forward and back. 'Doesn't feel high,' he said.

"An aide compared the soldier's sitting height to the table's height: it seemed about right.

"But Comrade Ma Qianzhu, gazing thoughtfully at the table's height, slowly shook his head.

"The cadres, not understanding why he shook his head, stood there in bewilderment.

"He said: consider that patients come in different heights. This patient is quite tall—but what about shorter cadres and soldiers? Their convenience must be considered. These men were wounded in service and have already made great sacrifices; we must care for their health and daily life in every possible way.

"The medical staff realized that dear Comrade Ma Qianzhu, like a doting mother, was worrying about everyone who came here to recover. They were so moved their throats tightened.

"Every room in the Ma'ao Army-Navy Hospital overflowed with the transmigrators' love for the people and their meticulous care.

"Manufacturing Director Zhan Wuya immediately declared that upon returning, he would improve the beds with adjustable mechanisms, so every patient could recover in the most comfortable environment.

"'The matter is small, but our soldiers are treasures of the regime—not to be neglected for a moment,' he said.

"Then the delegation distributed comfort items to the glorious wounded. Though the items were simple, they carried the profound affection of the Yuan Laoyuan and the people. These blessings, heavy as Mount Tai, shone like the sun into every patient's heart.

"A soldier with a fractured arm, encased in heavy plaster, needing a nurse's help even to eat or dress, was able to accept the weighty comfort package with his own hands when it was placed at his bedside.

"When they reached the rest room, Comrade Ma Qianzhu suddenly asked: why were comfort items not being distributed in those other buildings?

"'The patients there are enemy prisoners who came to invade us,' the hospital director said.

"'In that case, they too should receive some comfort items.'

"Those around him were surprised.

"Throughout history, wounded prisoners had usually met death. But here in Lingao, they received the best medical care.

"Someone said, not understanding: 'They are enemies—enemies who tried to harm the people of Lingao. Treating them and letting them live is already the greatest mercy.'

"'Even former enemies, now that they have laid down their arms and submitted, should be treated equally,' Comrade Ma Qianzhu said. 'Only thus can we fully demonstrate our magnanimity that embraces all under heaven.'

"Everyone present was overwhelmed by the transmigrators' boundless generosity.

"..."

In reality, the visit to the prisoner ward lasted only about fifteen minutes, with a simple speech. That speech did move many hearts and fill them with gratitude—but not because of the evening snack of dried fish.

The core of Ma Qianzhu's speech was the question of their future. He promised that once all the wounded recovered, the Aoosong regime would employ them, giving each a job so they could support their families.

Days earlier, Ma Qianzhu had learned from He Ping's report that about one-third of the hospitalized imperial soldiers would be left with varying degrees of disability. Prisoners without disabilities would be sent straight to labor gangs after recovery. But in ancient times, the disabled could rarely survive. Most men who enlisted came from impoverished families with no other options; returning home as cripples meant death.

This was the angle he used to move the prisoners' hearts—to let them fully experience the difference between the old society and the new. This group of wounded prisoners later became some of the most committed supporters of the new order.

After the visit, Ma Qianzhu asked the hospital's acting director: "What's the mortality rate?" He was very interested in the hospital's treatment efficiency.

"Very low. Almost everyone who receives timely treatment survives. The two great treasures—antibiotics and tetanus serum—have saved many lives." said Ning Jinghai, who had returned to Ma'ao with the medical corps. "But the tetanus serum's effectiveness varies. Some batches work well, others poorly. On average, about 70%."

"Two-thirds effective—that's quite good."

"Yes, we can only look at it that way." Ning Jinghai was not entirely comfortable with such rough standards. "We're just short of transmigrator doctors and nurses. Conditions here are relatively poor."

"Poor conditions can be improved." Ma Qianzhu reached into his pocket, pulled out a cigarette, lit it, and took a drag. "Conditions are poor, nobody wants to come. How about you become the director of the Ma'ao Hospital?"

"Me?" Ning Jinghai hesitated. He was indeed trained as a doctor and had practiced clinically for years, but his later work was unrelated to medicine. Whether in treatment or health administration, he was quite rusty.

"Yes—aren't you a PhD?"

"I have a PhD in computational biology. The connection to medicine is, well, tenuous at best."

"That doesn't matter."

"Then—shouldn't this go through proper procedures...?"

"Of course, of course. But first, you need to express interest."

"I understand. I'll register when I return to Lingao."

After leaving the hospital, the delegation members held discussions with the transmigrator army officers at the Ma'ao base. The talks were confidential, covering every aspect of the campaign—mainly after-action reviews.

An impeachment attempt by some transmigrators had collapsed in its preparatory stages for failing to secure two-thirds of the full membership's support. But a thirty-five-point inquiry submitted by a faction in the Yuan Laoyuan required detailed responses from the Executive Committee and the armed forces.

Wen Desi handed the document to He Ming: "Frankly, many questions are not easy to answer. Give them serious thought."

"We'll simply tell the truth," He Ming said, scanning a few pages. "I think I should be the one attending the inquiry hearings—Chen Haiyang at most. Better not to summon other transmigrator officers, lest someone use the occasion to stir trouble."

"Of course, of course," Ma Qianzhu nodded. "The Executive Committee has also been criticized, but I fully understand. This is what democracy means."

Wen Desi waved his hand: "Let's make it a habit to review every campaign. The PDCA cycle—Plan, Do, Check, Act. We're doing exactly that now: discussing issues found and how to improve. As for the Yuan Laoyuan hearings, just go through the motions."

That day, a series of reviews addressed problems identified during the counter-encirclement campaign—including weapon quality, soldier training, tactical deployment, logistics equipment, and the combat system.

"Quality control of the self-manufactured Minié rifles is poor; the sights are inaccurate."

"Barrel and mechanism lifespan is insufficient. Rated barrel life is 200 rounds, but after 100 actual rounds, rifling erosion is severe. If we hadn't brought many spare rifles, we'd have been fighting with bayonets."

Zhan Wuya took notes: "Machining capacity is fine; materials are still substandard."

"Black-powder grenades lack power."

"We're considering switching to fixed-cartridge rifles with new propellant."

"All soldiers should switch to steel helmets. Rattan helmets offer inadequate protection—wearing them is pointless."

"Military boots are of poor quality. Cloth-soled shoes wear out quickly; straw sandals cause serious foot injuries. Fortunately, there were no long marches."

"Company-level commanders should also be issued binoculars."

"A military academy should be put on the agenda."

...

The compiled materials filled a thick volume. Ma Qianzhu ordered it sent to Lingao immediately as reference material for the next Executive Committee plenary session.

That afternoon, all combatants—soldiers, militia, and laborers—received comfort packages. The packages were practical: bolts of cloth and silk, tobacco and liquor. All participants also received varying bonuses. Fubogun officers and soldiers each received three months' extra pay. Militia and laborers received the equivalent of one month's pay for a Fubogun private first class. Those awarded merit medals received additional bonuses.

That evening, sumptuous feasts were laid out in mess halls and on the parade grounds. Each man's wooden tray held two meat dishes: a piece of meat, two fish cutlets, and scrambled eggs. Both meat and vegetable dishes were exquisitely prepared—cooked by chefs brought from the Commercial Hall restaurant and cooperative restaurants. Barrels of kvass filled the tables. Anyone not on duty could drink freely—as much as they wanted.

Officers, soldiers, militia, and laborers sat around the tables, grinning and feasting. Delegation members scattered through the camp, visiting every table to propose toasts.

Even though they were drinking only kvass, drinking their fill still produced a pleasant buzz. The entire Ma'ao base was immersed in an ocean of joy.
