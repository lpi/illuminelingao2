# Chapter 681 - Village Consolidation

"Is it him?"

"It's him." The laborer said quietly.

"Carry this body to the village and dump it on the threshing floor." He ordered. "Let everyone see what happens to traitors!"

Under the anxious eyes of the villagers, the Fubogun marched into the village, then began demolishing the liaison's house. In less than fifteen minutes, the entire structure was leveled. Everything torn down was hauled outside the village and burned. Only the massive bamboo beam was kept.

Soldiers drove up a cow, dragging an iron plow behind it, and deeply turned the soil on the now-bare foundation. Then a sack of sea salt was scattered into the furrows and buried.

Finally, the bamboo beam was erected on the foundation, and the body of the liaison who had betrayed the work team was hung upon it.

"Don't take it down until it becomes bones!" Lin Shenhe ordered.

A new work team was dispatched from Danzhou. Lin Shenhe acted as interim team leader. Then Liu Yixiao and Yu Zhiqian also arrived at Zhaopu Village with the work team. For the moment, Danzhou's power center shifted to this desolate little hamlet.

Liu Yixiao expressed concern: "Is it appropriate for you to come here too?"

"It's not as if there are no transmigrators left in Danzhou city." Yu Zhiqian said. "I need to survey the battlefield. Besides, with such a major incident, if leadership doesn't personally visit the front line, what will the Yuan Laoyuan think?"

The entire village then underwent a major cleansing. The new work team no longer discussed developing mountain land or cultivating cash crops. They weren't even conducting the previous recruitment work for soldiers and laborers.

Both Lin Shenhe and Liu Yixiao suspected there were other people in the village connected to the bandits. Additionally, Liu Yixiao believed the villagers couldn't possibly know nothing about which bandit gang had attacked.

These questions had to be thoroughly clarified. Without digging out the roots of danger, peaceful construction was impossible.

Under soldiers' supervision, the men of the village built a bamboo palisade around the settlement, dug a trench, and erected a watchtower inside. Villagers leaving for field work required approval from work-team personnel stationed in the village. Permanent residents were registered in a new household-registration system.

Several work-team members wearing blue collar tabs began conducting individual "back-to-back" interviews with villagers. From eighty-year-olds to eight-year-olds, everyone was interviewed; everyone had to pass.

This investigation turned every villager's history inside out. Eventually someone revealed that the villager Chen Lianjian had connections to bandits.

This person had been a bandit for many years, only returning to farm after being injured and losing use of one leg. He had a wife and several daughters. With no able-bodied male laborers, the family barely scraped by.

Chen Lianjian said he had indeed been a bandit, but not with the gang that came.

"They're Hu Lanyan's men! Nothing to do with me—I absolutely didn't invite them!" Chen Lianjian protested his innocence repeatedly. "Hu Lanyan's bunch came over from Lingao!"

Chen Lianjian didn't know much about Hu Lanyan's gang—only that they had come from Lingao the previous year, had many men, and immediately became the largest bandit gang in the area upon arriving in Danzhou.

Lin Shenhe slapped the table: "Tell me everything you know about local bandit activity—confess honestly!"

Chen Lianjian was illiterate and had been only a lowly bandit. He didn't know much of value. But he still revealed information about local bandit aliases, gang numbers, methods, and jargon. Lin Shenhe realized this man could be very useful. If handed to professional investigators, even more "material" could be extracted.

"Guards, lock him up separately." Lin Shenhe instructed. "Watch him carefully!"

"Yes!" The guard was about to leave. Lin Shenhe stopped him. "Also arrest his wife and daughters—lock them up separately!"

"This humble one is already a cripple! I can never work that trade again—I wouldn't dare have such thoughts! Please investigate, Your Honor!" Chen Lianjian pleaded desperately. He feared the Australians might use him and his family as "chickens" to scare the monkeys, treating them like the liaison.

"Should we kill a few to establish authority?" Lin Shenhe asked Liu Yixiao. "We could execute Chen Lianjian for his bandit history."

Liu Yixiao shook his head: "That's not appropriate. Chen Lianjian wasn't involved in the attack on the work team. Most villagers are neither principals nor accomplices—at most they failed to act heroically. Killing under those circumstances would be unjustified."

"It's really a shame not to kill a few people." Yu Zhiqian was greatly disappointed. "This won't deter the locals!"

"The people have long lived in hardship; inevitably their thinking has become numb and obtuse—they only know self-preservation." Fang Jinghan, who was directing the political investigation and social survey, said. "This is typical submissive-populace thinking—any master will do, as long as there's a way to survive. They're so poor they have nothing to lose anyway."

"I still think we should execute a batch." Yu Zhiqian was unwilling to let the villagers off so easily. "Without killing, we can't establish authority in Danzhou! It severely affects Danzhou's public security!"

Liu Yixiao firmly opposed: "Slaughtering innocents is meaningless! These villagers are detestable, but there's no justified reason for execution. Indiscriminate killing only reveals our inner weakness."

Though Liu Yixiao firmly opposed massacring the village or killing people, he had no clear idea how to handle the matter.

His report on the Zhaopu Village incident to Lingao caused an uproar in the Yuan Laoyuan. The news from Liu Muzhou was very bad. Transmigrators were extremely dissatisfied with his work. He might well be removed from his position as Danzhou Work Team leader.

Once that position was lost, his hope of becoming the first Danzhou County Magistrate would be completely dashed. Moreover, this political stain would be very difficult to wash away. He was both dejected and anxious. He could only try to score points in the follow-up handling.

If his handling of the local villagers was too lenient, it would inevitably provoke greater displeasure in the Yuan Laoyuan. According to Liu Muzhou's communication, some transmigrators were even demanding the village be massacred.

But excessive cruelty would also alienate some transmigrators. How to balance severity and leniency had him in a difficult position.

After much deliberation, Fang Jinghan proposed a "collective punishment" plan.

The plan was to confiscate all property of Zhaopu Village residents as punishment for the work team's destruction.

"That's nothing—what property do they have?"

"The land here, though little, is property."

"Fine. What do we do with this land?" Danzhou likewise had no shortage of land—only people.

"The focus isn't the land—stripping them of land strips them of resources to survive here." Fang Jinghan said. "All the village's labor becomes population directly at our disposal. If you like, you can call them 'state slaves.'"

"Like how all immigrants are contract slaves..."

"Exactly. We relocate the entire village to better conditions through village consolidation, turning villagers into our directly controlled population. Make it Danzhou's first commune!"

"Thirty-odd households is a commune? Too few people."

"We implement village consolidation—gradually relocate and merge these small villages. This facilitates population management and control while promoting development."

After population relocation, the area could be completely abandoned—it had little development value anyway. When mountain resources needed developing in the future, new migrants could be moved in.

As for the relocated villagers, Fang Jinghan suggested immediate utilization. First, all eligible males aged eighteen to twenty-five would be drafted as soldiers.

"The military is a great melting pot." Fang Jinghan said. "Into the military's melting pot they go, where Wei Aiwen feeds them some gruel, they march in formation for three years and develop discipline. When they come out, they'll be qualified 'new people.' For adults, only such coercion works."

Children under eighteen would all be sent to Lingao for compulsory education. Younger ones would attend national school; older ones would go to apprenticeship training. The remaining people would serve as laborers. No manpower would be wasted.

"Follow this approach." Liu Yixiao nodded, approving the plan. "Road construction currently needs labor. After this group is moved to the new location, start with three months of road work."

"Better to build the commune first." Yu Zhiqian hastily added. "I've seen that Zhonghe Post's garrison city has a good foundation—plenty of empty buildings, completely adequate to house immigrants. Make Zhonghe Post the site of Danzhou's first commune."

The following week, more work-team members and a second infantry company arrived from Danzhou. The village was tightly surrounded by soldiers. Then the work team entered in batches, ordering each household to pack up and prepare for relocation.

The villagers were very poor. Their only real property was a few ragged clothes, farm tools, and the most basic necessities. The best-off families had cattle.

"Except for clothes, valuables, and livestock, don't bring anything!" Native work-team members shouted repeatedly through megaphones. "The new village will have everything. Food and drink will be provided on the road!"

By transmigrator standards, the villagers had nothing the transmigrators would consider property except themselves and their livestock. Local farm tools were so inferior they might as well be melted down for scrap. Even the most precious iron pots seemed to the transmigrators like a waste of iron. Not to mention the hygiene concerns with their utensils. After comprehensive consideration, everyone agreed that a full supply system would be simpler.

Items left in the village would be inspected; usable materials—iron goods, metal objects, cotton and hemp textiles—would be disinfected and recovered. Items without value would all be destroyed on site. Houses included would all be demolished, completely cutting off any thought of immigrants returning.

The only thing left in the village was the severely rotting corpse hanging from the bamboo pole. Flies buzzed around it.

As the people shouldered their belongings and set off, demolition work was already beginning in the village. The rumbling collapse of houses and rising dust brought expressions of grief and bewilderment to the immigrants' faces.
