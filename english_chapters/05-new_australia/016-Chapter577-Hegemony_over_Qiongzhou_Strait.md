# Chapter 577 - Hegemony over the Qiongzhou Strait

The decision to depart for Lingao was known only to a few close confidants within the Li household. Li Luoyou reckoned the court would sooner or later send troops against Lingao, so the fewer who knew, the better. Besides Quark, he brought only Gu Baocheng, his personal servant Saoye, and a few capable household attendants.

Though the matter was settled, it was now year's end. The third year of Chongzhen arrived in the blink of an eye. Year-end affairs were tedious with many social obligations. After handling all public and private business, the second day of the second month—the "Dragon Raises Its Head" festival—passed before Li Luoyou finally found time to arrange the Lingao trip.

The most convenient way to reach Lingao was of course to take a Gaoguang Shipping Company vessel from Guangzhou. These ships primarily carried cargo but also took passengers, with extremely cheap fares. However, the environment was noisy and uncomfortable, with people and cargo mixed together. Using his own private vessel would be too conspicuous, and the seas were unsafe—if some maritime heroes got wind and kidnapped him for ransom, that would be troublesome. While he was pondering this, Saoye reminded him that the Yang Runkaitang firm in Foshan had business dealings with Lingao—why not go through them?

"Does Master still remember? At Mr. Lin's banquet in Foshan last time, there was a Mr. Liu from Lingao at the table, said to be the manager of a pharmacy there. His family seems to be related to Mr. Yang of Yang Runkaitang. Going through this route would be both safe and well-connected—wouldn't that be the best of both worlds?"

At Saoye's reminder, Li Luoyou recalled it too. He immediately ordered his diary brought over. He had a habit of recording everything, large and small. Of course, his diary wasn't about how his mood was bad today, or how so-and-so was a scoundrel, or which concubine needed discipline—such trivial personal matters. Rather, it concerned commercial affairs: what business he'd conducted that day, whom he'd met, what they'd discussed, what new ideas had occurred to him.

This habit he'd learned from Portuguese merchants while doing business in Macau. He found this method helped him not forget things, so he'd developed the habit. No matter how busy each day, he would record it all before sleep.

Flipping through his diary, he found details richer than what Saoye had mentioned. So Runshitang Pharmacy in Lingao was indeed a useful channel.

He then summoned his chief secretary, Advisor Feng, to ask if there was a Runshitang branch locally.

"Runshitang has no branch in Guangdong," Advisor Feng had an excellent memory and knew every shop and person who had ever done business or had contact with Liaohai Trading, "but they have an accounting office in Foshan, specifically handling dealings with Yang Runkaitang for buying and selling medicines. The person in charge is called Liu Benshan."

"If Master wishes to go to Lingao, you could ask Mr. Yang Shiyi to make introductions." Advisor Feng said. "Runshitang in Lingao and Yang Runkaitang in Foshan are branches from the same root—the two proprietors are first cousins."

Though going to Lingao was confidential and the fewer who knew, the better, Yang Shiyi need not be avoided—this man had been involved with Li Luoyou in trading Liaodong goods and had connections to Lingao. He absolutely wouldn't dare speak carelessly outside.

The decision made, he sent another personal servant who handled confidential matters to Foshan to arrange this.

Li Luoyou wanted to go to Lingao; Yang Shiyi naturally wouldn't slight this "god of wealth." He immediately contacted Liu Benshan. Within just a few days, the servant returned from Foshan, saying everything was arranged.

Because the matter was confidential, when Li Luoyou left Guangzhou he only announced he was going to inspect the Foshan branch—as a prominent merchant in Guangzhou, he received visitors daily and couldn't secretly vanish for ten days or half a month. After reaching Foshan, Liu Benshan would arrange his travel to Lingao.

Yang Shiyi showed every courtesy to this god of wealth, specially chartering a double-masted Fujian ship—one that regularly sailed to Lingao. The captain knew the route well. He'd also carefully furnished the cabin. He even wanted to send capable household servants to attend them on the voyage, but Li Luoyou declined—he didn't want to make too much of a show. Yang Shiyi could only send along ample food and wine for the journey.

The voyage passed without incident. This day the weather was fine. Li Luoyou emerged from his cabin to get some air on deck. He saw the waters here were extremely narrow, with green mountains, trees, villages, and estates on both shores clearly visible. Curious, he asked:

"Where are we?"

"We've reached the Qiongzhou Strait. That over there is Leigong Island." The captain looked quite relaxed, pointing to a small island near the shore on the ship's port side.

"This is the boundary between Lingao and Chengmai. Past Leigong Island is Lingao County's coast. In less than two hours we'll reach Bopu Harbor."

Li Luoyou nodded. He'd never been to Qiongzhou before and had no concept of this large island. His businesses spanned Guangdong, but Qiongzhou Prefecture alone he'd never touched. The place was sparsely populated with meager products—besides timber, coconuts, betel nuts, red and white rattan, and such, there were no major exports, and nothing much to sell there either.

What did the Australians rely on to prosper a remote, desolate little county? Li Luoyou found this intensely interesting.

Quark also emerged from the cabin. He was dressed entirely in Ming Chinese fashion, except for a jet-black square scholar's cap to conceal his hair. But his blue eyes still betrayed his identity.

The captain had seen foreigners before and thought nothing of it.

"God, what beautiful scenery." Quark said. He somewhat greedily breathed the fresh sea air—these past days he hadn't dared show himself, and only now emerged.

"The captain says we'll reach Lingao in a few more hours."

"Really?" Quark said excitedly. "I really want to see the legendary great iron ship."

As they were talking, they spotted a triangular-sailed vessel cutting through the waves near the coast. Li Luoyou immediately realized: this wasn't a Chinese ship—you could tell from the hull design and rigging—it looked like a Western sailing ship.

"What kind of ship is that?" He pointed it out to Quark.

"That's a triangular fore-and-aft rigged sloop!" Quark was no less astonished than Li Luoyou. This was a typical triangular-sailed sloop, identical to those he'd seen at his English seaside hometown. But he'd never seen one in Asia—this type of vessel generally only sailed coastal waters and didn't run long-distance trade.

"That's an Australian patrol boat." The captain interjected. "From here on to Lingao is Australian territory."

"The Australians patrol here?" Li Luoyou was somewhat surprised—truly brazen! "The navy doesn't intervene?"

"The navy would need the ability to intervene, wouldn't they? The navy's only good at demanding money. When they see a few pirates, they run faster than rabbits! Would they dare meddle in Australian affairs?" The captain's words dripped with contempt for government forces. "The Australians patrol here daily. When they encounter pirates, they wipe them out. When ships are in distress, they're willing to rescue them—no hesitation. Since Lingao's patrol boats appeared, the strait has become much safer—pirates don't dare enter."

"That ship—she's sailing beautifully!" Quark exclaimed. "Sailing close to the wind! God!" He shrieked again—the ship had heeled over at an angle that seemed about to capsize.

"The Australians are truly first-rate sailors!" Quark mopped his brow with a large handkerchief. "Even in my homeland they're no better than this."

"They sailed great iron ships across vast oceans to come here—naturally they'd be skilled in seamanship." Li Luoyou watched the triangular-sailed vessel's movements closely. Its speed was fast and agile. The court navy's clumsy, obsolete warships would have trouble even defending themselves without cannon.

The patrol boat gradually drew closer—so close he could see sailors scurrying about on deck, furling and unfurling sails. On the tilting, pitching deck, sailors in blue cloth jackets still moved and worked rapidly. From the mast to both gunwales hung rows of fishing nets—he didn't know their purpose. Everything on deck was orderly, and most conspicuous were the long cylindrical objects wrapped in oilcloth on the fore and aft decks. Probably Australian cannon.

"Quickly raise the flag!" the captain ordered a crewman. Soon a triangular flag was fluttering from the mast. The sloop seemed satisfied; it turned its bow away and departed.

"What does that mean?" Li Luoyou asked with interest.

"This ship of mine is registered at Bopu." The captain said. "So I have a flag. Raising it means I can pass inspection-free and sail directly to Lingao. Unregistered ships may be ordered to heave to for inspection."

"Interesting." Li Luoyou thought the Australians' management was highly systematic—not like merchants' methods at all, more like a government.

"What if you don't stop?" Quark suddenly asked.

"What's this red-haired gentleman saying?" The captain said. "Not stop? Never mind the cannon up there—one shot and even an immortal couldn't take it. Even a volley of muskets would be quite enough. Besides, inspection doesn't take your money or goods—why look for trouble?"

The captain added: "The Australians in Lingao are quite good. Their officers are polite and don't extort money. Recently, ships entering and leaving port pay no duties. Merchants doing business there all speak well of them."

"Tax-free imports and exports—that's to attract merchants to trade there." Quark was quite excited. This suggested the Australians welcomed merchants for trade. His chances of establishing a trading post there were very good!

Though Macau was fine, it was Catholic territory after all. If not for Li Luoyou's protection, he'd have been expelled by the zealots long ago—possibly killed. He knew perfectly well what happened to his countrymen caught smuggling slaves in the Americas by the Spanish. As for Guangdong, he could only stay in the Li family's residences and trading houses, avoiding going out. Life was comfortable enough, but rather boring.

If he could establish a warehouse in Lingao, he could use it as a base to trade with the mainland—buying silk, sugar, and porcelain, storing them in Lingao, then catching a ship back to Surat to resell when the opportunity arose. Once he had more money, he'd simply buy his own ship for shipping. When his resources grew larger, he could negotiate with the Australians to allow an English trading post, bringing more English merchants to trade at Lingao. As trading post agent, his opportunities would be immeasurable...

John Quark's merchant heart beat wildly, as if countless gold coins were glittering before his eyes. He could hardly contain his impatience.

Quark Qiong swallowed and asked: "Are there many people coming to Lingao to trade?"

"Not many at first, but in the last six months or so it's picked up." The captain puffed on his pipe. "You can sell just about anything. Plus you can bring back lots of marketable Lingao goods on the return trip. Coming and going without empty runs, earning double—why wouldn't everyone be willing?"

"I see."

"Are you two gentlemen also here to trade?"

"What makes you say that?" Li Luoyou asked.

"Who'd go to that place if not to trade?" The captain laughed. "Besides, there's this red-haired gentleman. Red-hairs never lift a finger unless there's profit—wherever there's money to be made, they'll walk through mountains of knives and seas of fire. They'd fish coins out of a boiling oil pot."

Quark Qiong laughed heartily, repeatedly agreeing. Mercantilism was fashionable in Europe at the time. To Chinese ears, such words were disparaging; to this Englishman, they were praise.

Li Luoyou found this amusing and chatted with the captain for quite a while, only returning to his cabin when the sea grew rougher.

"Pack up the things—we'll be arriving soon." Li Luoyou instructed Saoye, then frowned. "Where's Baocheng?"

"Reporting to Master," Saoye said carefully, "he's still seasick today. He can't get up from his cabin."

"Such delicacy!" He'd been resting in his cabin since boarding due to seasickness. Li Luoyou thought—it had been five or six days now, and the seasickness still hadn't passed. The young man was about to be married, yet still so weak. As the sole blood descendant of his wife's family, would he have the ability to rebuild the family fortune? Thinking of this, he couldn't help but secretly worry.

While he himself lived, he would naturally do his utmost for Baocheng. But his own health was deteriorating. If something happened to him, never mind Baocheng establishing his own household and reviving the family name—even finding a secure position in the Li family would likely be difficult. Li Luoyou knew several close clansmen in his lineage had complained about him so nurturing and promoting an outsider.

Constantly, clan members sent intermediaries to approach his father or other elders, wanting to place their own sons and nephews under him to "learn some skills." And Gu Baocheng's existence repeatedly became evidence of his unwillingness to favor clan members.

"Hmph, useless at work, but every one of them is skilled at grabbing money." In recent years, over a dozen clansmen had come to Guangzhou seeking his patronage. Apart from a few, most were prepared to coast on ancestral connections. That was still manageable. Worse was their aggressive maneuvering—constantly trying to get close to him to "serve," hoping to land some money-handling position as "manager" or "steward."

"We share the same surname Li—if nephew doesn't look after uncle's affairs, who will?"

Li Luoyou had heard this kind of talk until he nearly vomited. Facts proved that clansmen were less reliable than hired outside staff—and when it came to skimming money, they were utterly self-righteous: it's all Li family money, why can't I use it? Li Luoyou was quite helpless against such people, yet couldn't easily send them away. He could only assign them idle positions, keeping them well-fed and comfortable to avoid trouble.

Whenever Li Luoyou thought of these clansmen, he felt vexed. For diversion, he took out a book to read. It was a copy of *Shushu Jiuzhang* (Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections)—a work by the Song Dynasty's Qin Jiushao.
