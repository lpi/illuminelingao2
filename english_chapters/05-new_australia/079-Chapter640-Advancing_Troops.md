# Chapter 640 Advancing Troops

On June 29, 1630, in the Gregorian calendar, the Fubo Army Field Army fully garrisoned the Grand Camp under Chengmai City. He Ming set up the campsite two kilometers northwest of the Chengmai County seat, less than two hundred meters from the post road. If the government army wanted to pass through the post road to reach Lingao, they had to capture this place.

The Grand Camp was a large pentagonal camp built according to the bastion defense system. The entire camp was protected by earthen ramparts more than a man's height. Cannons and bunkers were set up on the ramparts, and deep trenches and abatis lay below. High observation towers were customarily built on the ramparts. With the help of high-power telescopes, every move within more than ten kilometers around the Chengmai County seat could be seen clearly.

He Ming ordered: Immediate cut off all contact between Chengmai County seat and the outside world. Ambush sentries had been set up outside the three city gates of the county seat; anyone attempting to enter or leave the city would be arrested.

Seeing that entry and exit through the city gates were impossible, the government office in the city sent people to rappel down the city walls. Bei Wei ordered the snipers of the Special Reconnaissance Team, armed with bolt-action rifles equipped with scopes, to lie in ambush around the perimeter. In the following days, anyone attempting to rappel down was shot dead at the foot of the wall. Then people attempted to rappel down at night, but deadly gunshots still rang out in the dark night. By morning, those attempting to leave the city often lay dead under the city wall. No matter how pitch-black the night, it could not protect them.

Judging from the killed rappellers, they almost invariably carried urgent *Tangbao* (official reports). The captured reports were rushed to headquarters for opening. Aside from the clichés of requesting reinforcements and falsely boasting of battle results, they had written everything seen from the city wall into the reports in minute detail.

He Ming ordered: "Immediately blockade the city wall; do not allow the enemy to spy on our army!"

"*Ping*."

With the crisp crack of an SKS rifle, a militiaman peeping down from between the battlements swayed and fell.

"Hit! Chest shot!" The soldier monitoring activity on the wall with high-power binoculars on the observation tower said loudly.

"The score is 7:2 now; you guys need to catch up," Bei Wei said with a smile. Behind him stood five or six Special Reconnaissance Team warriors. Yang Zeng, the Light Infantry Company Commander of the 1st Infantry Battalion, stood beside him. Behind him were also several Light Infantrymen wearing green cords.

They were positioned on a small mound about two hundred meters from the city wall. At this distance, the bows and firearms on Chengmai's wall were powerless.

The Special Reconnaissance Team and Light Infantry stood here originally to execute the mission of sweeping enemy forces from the wall—He Ming ordered not to allow the enemy to spy on the Field Army's movements below, so the Light Infantry of each battalion used precision shooting to clear enemies from the wall while practicing combat marksmanship. The result turned into a competition between the Special Reconnaissance Team and the Light Infantry. The targets were all the *Minzhuang* (commoner conscripts) and village militia standing on the Chengmai city wall.

"The Special Reconnaissance Team uses better guns than us," Yang Zeng was a bit unconvinced. The Special Reconnaissance Team used Australian fast rifles; whether in rate of fire, accuracy, or range, they were a big step above the Minié rifles they used, and they didn't smoke when firing. Some guns even had scopes, able to hit targets at incredibly long distances.

"Oh, fine, I'll use a Minié rifle too." Bei Wei threw the SKS rifle in his hand to a soldier behind him and switched to a Minié rifle.

Judging from the English letters "WLB" branded on the stock, this Minié rifle should be one of the earliest batches assembled with seamless steel pipes and parts from the Old Space-Time. The gun was maintained very well. Bei Wei looked at it; there was also a "J+" mark on the stock, which was the symbol for high-precision rifles, indicating this rifle could be used by snipers.

"This gun isn't bad!" He praised, asking Yang Zeng, "Yours?"

Yang Zeng said: "It's mine. Now only sharpshooters in the Light Infantry Company are equipped with this kind of gun."

Bei Wei gestured, took a paper cartridge, and skillfully loaded the gun—the Special Reconnaissance Team also conducted shooting training with Minié rifles, and even trained with a miscellaneous assortment of captured muskets, three-barreled guns, and bird guns made in England, Portugal, Japan, and the Great Ming, in order to be able to use various weapons at hand in emergencies.

Bei Wei pressed his cheek to the gun several times and tried aiming, then shouted: "Indicate target!"

"Front, 2 o'clock direction!" The soldier on the sentry tower shouted.

The barrel of the Minié rifle quickly pointed in that direction. Then Bei Wei saw a figure flash behind a battlement. He didn't fire, focusing his attention on the nearby battlements.

Sure enough, he saw a figure near three or four battlements away. Almost completely by subconscious physical reaction, he completed the posture adjustment in an instant and pulled the trigger.

The bullet grazed the peeping militiaman and shattered a brick on the battlement. The militiaman was scared into crawling directly onto the ground.

A burst of laughter rang out on the mound. Bei Wei smiled and shook his head: "Missed by a bit!"

The accuracy of the Minié rifle ultimately couldn't be compared with rifles like the SKS. If he used an SKS, or even a bolt-action rifle, he could have fired a follow-up shot very quickly if the first missed. With a Minié rifle, that wasn't possible.

"My turn!" Yang Zeng was eager to try. He took back his J+ Minié rifle and reloaded. "Indicate target!"

The observation post reported: "Enemy, front, 11 o'clock direction."

Yang Zeng held his breath and focused.

"*Ping—*"

"Hit! Shoulder shot!"

"This kid! Count him lucky he dodged fast!" Yang Zeng said. "Hid behind the embrasure!"

"Enemy is moving a cannon!" The observation post on the tower suddenly shouted. "9 o'clock direction!"

"Free fire!" Bei Wei commanded.

Gunshots rang out disorderly. Because it was free fire, there was great controversy in judging who shot the killed target. Arguments arose frequently on the mound about who killed a certain target.

The *Minzhuang* moving the cannon fell one after another. The remaining people lay under the battlements, not daring to move.

"Quick, quick push the cannon!" A Squad Leader of the garrison troops behind waved a designated sword, threatening beheading to force the *Minzhuang* to continue moving the cannon.

The *Minzhuang* almost crawled on the ground to barely move the cannon to the firing position facing the mound.

Bei Wei didn't issue the order to enter foxholes. The biggest cannons on Chengmai wall were only "Bowl-Mouth Cannons." These were mid-Ming dynasty cannons, inferior even to medium-sized *Folangji* guns. Their range was at most one hundred meters; the shots couldn't reach the mound at all.

Sure enough, the hastily fired cannon produced no effect other than emitting a puff of thick smoke on the wall that slightly obscured the snipers' vision.

After the smoke cleared, a new round of shooting felled several more gunners. That Squad Leader unwillingly hid behind a battlement, waving his sword to force other *Minzhuang* to come up and continue firing.

Bei Wei could see in his binoculars that the Squad Leader's sword kept waving between the battlements, but his person never exposed even a little bit. It seemed he was a quite cunning fellow.

He pitied those sallow and emaciated *Minzhuang* and village militia a bit, being forced in batches to die for nothing—even if just wounded, the probability of death was very high under Ming dynasty medical conditions.

"Bring my .308 rifle!" Bei Wei ordered.

A Saiga-308 semi-automatic rifle came into his hands. This gun used NATO 7.62mm bullets; the muzzle energy and penetration were far greater than Minié bullets and M43 (SKS/AK-47) bullets.

He raised the rifle. That sword was still waving between the battlements, seeming to still threaten the *Minzhuang* to continue loading the cannon. He estimated the distance, wind force, and human body dimensions, slightly adjusted the muzzle, and pulled the trigger.

Yang Zeng and the others only saw dust and fragments of brick fly up on the battlement with the gunshot. Instantly, blood sprayed like rain from behind the battlement.

Blood spots sprayed all the way onto the brick wall of the South Gate tower. Everyone was startled, then cheered together. A dead silence fell over the city wall.

This terrifying competition swept away all defenders on the city wall. *Minzhuang* and village militia could only lie behind battlements, secretly peeping at the Hair Bandits' situation through firing ports. Even this wasn't safe; more than once, bullets passed directly through the narrow firing ports and shattered the heads of peeping militiamen.

Starting from July 3rd, morale in Chengmai City began to collapse. *Minzhuang* and village militia clamored one after another, unwilling to ascend the walls for defense. The Chengmai Magistrate attempted suicide in the chaos, but was persuaded by his private secretary not to rush into martyrdom—seeing the Hair Bandits' appearance, they didn't seem to want to take the city, so it was better to wait and see.

The Special Reconnaissance Team subsequently established a screening layer with a 10km radius centered on Chengmai County seat. Any government agents, *Tangma* scouts, or even ordinary commoners entering this screening layer were captured or killed without exception.

He Ming's thinking was clear: The enemy was numerous, and we were few. With the Field Army's combat power and weapon advantage, defeating He Rubin's unit in a pitched battle outside Chengmai was no problem. The difficulty lay in ensuring the capture of most prisoners. This forced him to ambush a portion of his troops in other directions, preventing the enemy from retreating to Qiongshan or scattering in flight.

The general situation around Chengmai County seat was: Chengmai County seat sat on the south bank of a small river, about three kilometers from the coastline. This river was not only the county's moat but also formed a river fork delta south of the city. However, this river was very shallow; before the rainy season arrived, the water depth was at most only 1 meter, unable to form an effective obstacle. Northwest of the county seat was a peninsula called Xiaoyingchang, where there was a deserted village. The village had a water well, but according to pre-war reconnaissance, the well had been contaminated by saline-alkali soil and wasn't suitable for drinking. The post road from Qiongshan passed outside the South Gate of the county seat, then turned northwest.

After repeated weighing, he decided to use only 2 battalions supported by artillery to hold firmly at the Grand Camp and block the Ming army passing through the post road. The 3rd Battalion would stand by in the mountains east of the county seat, waiting for an opportunity to cut off the government army's retreat while forcing them to continue closing in on the main force. The 5th Battalion would ambush south of the city waiting to launch an attack. Roughly forming an encirclement of the Ming army.

Of course, given the Field Army's strength, such an encirclement was not tight. It relied solely on the Fubo Army soldiers having better mobility and powerful firepower to achieve mobile interception of the enemy with fewer troops. If the opponent had one or two generals with outstanding organizational ability and good judgment, they could organize men and horses to break out in time. Therefore, he had to keep the last Infantry Battalion, the 6th, in hand as a reserve.

The operational concept was simple: Intercept the Ming army, defeat the Ming army, and then force their remnants towards the coastline.

Using 2 battalions of 1,800 infantry to intercept nearly 20,000 enemy troops was already an astonishing thing just from the numerical comparison. He Ming thought the problem wouldn't be too big. With sufficient artillery and defensive works, although winning might not be easy, it was enough to withstand the enemy.

"No matter how many men He Rubin has, he can't send them all up to charge at once—besides, the formation can't be spread out here. He inevitably can only attack with a few elite troops." He Ming explained his combat resolve to the officers. "It's difficult for the enemy to outflank and launch a flank attack: North of the Grand Camp, we have naval gunfire support. If he wants to dispatch troops to detour to the north of the Grand Camp to attack, they will fall under the double fire of the Navy and our camp, attacked from front and rear."

After the plan was determined, the 1st and 4th Battalions responsible for holding the position reinforced the Grand Camp's positions. In addition to the Artillery Battalion's cannons, the spare cannons brought by the artillery cadets were also deployed in the camp to intercept the enemy. A few 12-pounder mountain howitzers reinforced the 3rd and 5th Infantry Battalions for use as mobile firepower.

Then he called Bei Wei over: "Can you guarantee a 10km radius interruption?"

"I can." Bei Wei said without hesitation. "I have deployed multiple ambush sentries and patrol teams to guarantee no one within a 20km radius can scout our movements."

"Is the troop strength enough?"

"Barely enough. I have ordered all detachments of the Special Reconnaissance Team except the training detachment and Sanya detachment to verify report to Chengmai immediately for deployment—they will arrive tonight. Once these detachments arrive, the interruption will be more reliable."

"This matter is crucial." He Ming emphasized repeatedly. All his plans were built on troop mobility. No matter how strong the Fubo Army's mobility, it relied on two legs, so the ambushing troops couldn't leave the battle zone too far; otherwise, it would be difficult to rush to join the battle in time. Since ambushing nearby, they must completely interrupt all enemy reconnaissance, making them unable to grasp the movements.

According to materials provided by the Historical Data Team, the Ming army placed *Tang* (outposts/scouts) every 20 *li* during normal marches, and scouts were sent 30 *li* to the front, rear, left, and right. Moreover, Ming scouts were all cavalry, with considerable mobility. In addition, the Ming army might have dispatched spies in advance to investigate. So blinding the enemy's eyes and ears became an urgent matter.

After seeing Bei Wei, Chen Haiyang also came ashore to discuss coordination with him. Both sides agreed on communication signals and methods. Chen Haiyang also ordered the ten "Typewriters" on the warships to be dismantled and brought ashore with gunners and ammunition to assist in defense.

By this time, all units of the Field Army were fully prepared for battle. Not only did each unit know its own combat plan, but they also conducted on-site surveys of the battlefield where the great battle was about to unfold, to avoid any omissions.

On the morning of July 3rd, Special Reconnaissance Team scouts in Qiongshan sent the report: "Total enemy forces moving out." The Second Counter-Encirclement Campaign officially kicked off.

He Rubin's grand army departed from Qiongshan, marching forward along the post road. regarding war, his attitude was still prioritizing prudence. For this, as soon as he left Qiongshan, he sent out large batches of scouts and spies to inquire about the situation.

Chaozhou Lieutenant Colonel Tong Yizhen led a dozen adjutant generals and over two thousand soldiers walking in front. At the very front were three hundred cavalry led by his subordinate Chiliarch He Zhanran, prepared to attack rapidly once encountering enemies on the road, screening the deployment of the main infantry and firearms behind.

Cavalry was a very useful branch, but Guangdong didn't have many cavalry available, so the whole army only brought eight hundred mount. He Rubin believed cavalry wasn't very useful in Hainan, and this time it would mostly be siege warfare by encirclement, so bringing more cavalry was useless. Moreover, news from everywhere said the Hair Bandits lacked mules and horses and didn't constitute a threat.

Huizhou Lieutenant Colonel Yan Zungao led two thousand soldiers to bring up the rear. They were preceded by the Firearms Camp led by the Governor's Standard Firearms Camp Chiliarch Li Baidao. The heavy cannons were mostly pulled by oxen, and there were many vehicles, so the marching speed was very slow, walking second to last. Before the Firearms Camp was the Cloud Ladder Camp. This was a professional unit specialized in attacking cities and seizing stockades. Six hundred Cloud Ladder soldiers carried disassembled cloud ladders and many devices. If a direct assault on a stockade was needed, the Cloud Ladder soldiers would serve as the assault vanguard.

The Governor's Standard Camp Central Army Garrison Commander Sun Changzuo and Ye Zhengfang led a dozen personal generals, one thousand five hundred Standard Camp soldiers, and five hundred of He Rubin's household guards to protect the Old Camp. Zhao Ruyi and the private secretaries moved with the Old Camp. because they were marching to war, he expressed he wanted to march on horseback, but He Rubin still considerately prepared a sedan chair and three shifts of bearers for his use at any time.

He Rubin led his personal soldiers and a portion of the main generals walking in front of the Old Camp. On the post road, men shouted and horses neighed; smoke and dust rolled. Although it had rained continuously for the past few days, the weather was slightly better these days, and the sunlight was very scorching. Added to the heavy dust on the road, many soldiers drank all the water in their portable clay jars and skin bags before walking much distance.

Almost every time they reached a clear river, soldiers and horses would crowd to the riverbank to drink water. People crowding and horses neighing, a chaotic mess.

"Tell the generals, keep men and horses moving fast!" He Rubin urged his subordinate generals, not letting soldiers stay too long by the river, lest they disorder the ranks and be raided by the enemy in the gap.

But the enemy obviously had no intention of raiding. Even under such high-risk conditions as the whole army fording rivers, scouts didn't find traces of enemy activity nearby.

The 24 *Tang* scouts sent out continuously sent back reports of peace on all sides. He Rubin was slightly reassured.

"Order all armies, no delay allowed!" He commanded.

The distance between Qiongshan and Chengmai was only a half-day journey at normal marching speed. If following the Government Army's average speed of twenty or thirty *li* a day, this bit of road could take three or four days. But Hainan was different from other places; let alone few prefectures and counties along the way, the countryside was also very impoverished. Unless it was prefectures like Qiongshan or Danzhou with official granaries storing large amounts of grain, they simply couldn't supply a grand army. If they marched slowly according to old rules, they would exhaust the grain carried by the army prematurely instead. He Rubin instructed the generals to urge all units to advance as quickly as possible.
