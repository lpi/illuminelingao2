# Chapter 746 - Shipbuilding

As they were speaking, suddenly a fat man in his thirties entered the canteen. His stalwart figure, knee-length shorts, short-sleeved T-shirt, waist pack and pistol holster strapped to his belly with a black nylon belt, and the straw hat buckled on the back of his head all proved he was a Senator through and through.

The indigenous employees who were eating were already accustomed to Senators entering and leaving the canteen—several Senators could be seen in the shipyard every day, guiding work at various construction sites and workshops.

He poked his head out looking around, suddenly spotted Jiang Ye and the others, immediately his eyes lit up, and he waved his arm:

"Quick, come a few people, receive the goods!"

Zhou Bili picked his teeth, surrounded by several apprentices, and arrived at the shipyard's dedicated station—actually just a dedicated unloading platform. A diesel locomotive on the track was emitting steam, and several workers climbed up and down checking the locomotive—now these diesel locomotives had all been gazified; the originally somewhat empty flatbed locomotive had added a coal gas generator and a dedicated gas storage bag.

Of course, Lingao-made coal gas generators and gas storage bags had quite a few flaws. Gas leakage was the most frequent and serious problem. Fortunately, this kind of locomotive was completely exposed to the air; a little gas leakage wouldn't be fatal.

On the flatbed car, a yellow hurricane lantern hung—this indicated the car was loaded with extra-long or special specification cargo. Currently loaded on the flatbed car were several huge mast timbers.

Large sailing ships had very high requirements for mast timber supply; it required the mast to be straight and must have a certain diameter. Preferably a single straight timber. In Europe, shipbuilding materials mainly came from Eastern Europe, specifically the forests of Poland and Russia. In the coastal areas of South China, finding such suitable timber was very difficult—traditional Chinese sailing ships rarely had such tall masts. Even the large timbers captured from Baitu Village were not enough to manufacture such masts.

Among the timber obtained from Vietnam and Sanya, there were also very few such large timbers. Although there was no lack of high-quality hard timber like teak and nanmu, not many could meet the mast requirements in height and diameter. Finally, Wen Desi decided to give up using whole mast timbers and adopt the British practice of composite masts.

So-called composite masts, as the name implies, are masts connected by multiple pieces of timber. Such masts are not limited by the size of the timber itself; basically, masts for sailing ships of any size can be manufactured. Of course, such masts cannot compare with natural single straight timber masts in overall strength.

"After the British were cut off from mast timber supply, they muddled along with composite masts for a quite long time," Wen Desi said. "Before we get more suitable timber, just use composite masts."

Even for manufacturing composite masts, one should try to use large timbers of the same species. Wu Kuangming instructed Forestry Department personnel to search for all suitable timber from the inventory. And collected information from traders to query tree species for large timber that could be obtained relatively stably in large quantities. The final conclusion was Firmiana (Chinese Fir).

Firmiana is a soft timber, not ideal as ship timber, but definitely not unusable. In fact, most commercial ships in the coastal South China of this spacetime used Firmiana extensively for manufacturing because other hard timbers lacked large pieces. The British also once used large amounts of fir and pine to manufacture masts and decks, using the best oak for hulls, keels, and ribs.

"Three Firmiana mast timbers, dimensions are..." He read the numbers on the delivery note. "You measure them, prepare to receive."

These large timbers had already undergone a series of preliminary treatments; the next step was to send them to the shipyard's dedicated fumigation kiln for treatment. Hai Lin, who delivered the timber, was an expert in timber treatment technology and ran to the shipyard every few days; Zhou Bili was already very familiar with him. He casually handed him a cigarette.

"This time's Firmiana is really big enough!" He chatted casually.

"Still not big enough." Hai Lin took the cigarette and consciously tucked it behind his ear; no smoking on the platform was the rule. Steam locomotives were okay, but coal gas locomotives were dangerous explosive equipment.

"Of course, having whole timber would be better. Now hooping masts has become a complex job."

"The biggest and best ones are all taken by the Emperor," Hai Lin said. "Either building palaces or building tombs; slightly inferior ones are cut into sections for coffins."

"If only we could have Southeast Asian timber."

"That depends on when the wise and martial Governor-General makes this great decision," Hai Lin said sarcastically. "Let's go, look at the place for hooping masts. I'm curious to see how these different-sized logs are spliced together."

In the metalworking workshop with large-span iron truss structures, steam filled the air, and calcium carbide lamps radiated dazzling light. The loud overlapping sounds of two steam drop hammers, the squeaking of overhead cranes, the chants of lifting and lowering, and the sounds of forgers beating forgings made the entire workshop appear vibrant.

In a corner of the workshop was the mast hooping work area. Round timbers with interfaces cut according to the optimal strength combination designed by CAD software were already mounted on iron trolleys, interlocking tightly with each other—in interlocking technology, Wu Kuangming implemented some traditional mortise and tenon joint techniques to ensure tighter interlocking. According to the requirements of technical data, workers had already driven iron fasteners into the interlocking parts to ensure connection strength.

When Hai Lin and the others arrived at the workshop, workers were installing iron hoops for the composite mast under Lu Youtian's command. Installing iron hoops could ensure the strength of composite masts to the greatest extent. Even single straight timber masts needed iron hoops installed.

The parts to add iron hoops were already marked with ink brushes, with different numbers on them—because the mast diameter was not completely consistent top to bottom, each iron hoop was customized according to the dimensions of the part. The diameter of the iron hoop was slightly smaller than the mast diameter to ensure it would hoop tightly once sleeved on.

Iron hoops were heating in the heating furnace nearby. The heating furnace used coal gas as fuel, guaranteeing calorific value and clean usage. Iron hoops were heated to red-hot in the furnace so they could just fit onto the mast.

Lu Youtian stared at the industrial thermometer beside the heating furnace—since having this thing, the mysterious craftsmanship of manual artisans in the past was fart. In the past, he relied on looking at the color of the furnace fire and workpiece, skin temperature, and listening to slight sounds from the furnace to distinguish if the appropriate temperature was reached. This was his accumulated experience over many years; even if he was willing to teach, young apprentices found it hard to understand and grasp quickly. Since the Australians widely promoted this thick and ugly so-called thermometer, this secret that could only be sensed but not explained became worthless. The Australians compiled specialized process manuals for every kind of workpiece and processing technology; special workpieces would come with process sheets. Workers only needed to check the process manual to know what temperature to heat to, then look at the thermometer display to achieve a level not a hair's breadth different from him, the old master, in heat control.

This matter once made Lu Youtian very broken. But he quickly adapted to this new technology—after all, relying on completely non-standard personal senses wasn't reliable. It was also less prone to problems when he processed and manufactured workpieces.

"Take Piece Number One!" seeing the temperature had risen to the specified value, he hurriedly roared. His son, Metalworking Workshop Level 1 Mechanic Lu Shouyong, hurriedly used long-handled iron tongs to take the red-hot iron hoop out of the furnace. Several other workers holding iron tongs helped together, slowly sleeving the glowing iron hoop onto the mast. While touching the mast surface, the iron hoop emitted wisps of white smoke and sizzling burning sounds. Occasionally flames appeared. When the iron hoop was finally in place and stuck, a burst of small flames appeared around it. Workers quickly extinguished them.

"Watching this stuff is Fucking exciting!" Hai Lin said with emotion, "Industry is turning the impossible into possible!"

Next, workers began to hoop the second and third ones; the entire mast hooping work would continue until the next morning. The number of masts needed in the shipbuilding plan was quite large!

"I heard the ships you build still use rope for anchor chains?" Hai Lin asked Zhou Bili who was observing the processing. "Why not use iron chains?"

Zhou Bili said: "This is to save iron usage—and save production time. Hand-forging iron chains is very time-consuming. Actually, iron chains are much easier to use than anchor cables."

"Didn't the Navy fish up chain-boom iron chains from the Pearl River Estuary? Why not use readymade ones?"

"I've seen those things. The craftsmanship is too rough, iron material isn't good either, probably rushed out temporarily. Very brittle. They've probably already been melted into molten iron by Ji Wusheng."

"Iron is easier to talk about; it's those copper sheets for sheathing the ship bottom that Wu De is probably scratching his head about. Although thin copper sheets, they still have to cover the bottom of a large ship."

"We captured quite a few bronze cannons from Guangdong this time; at most, melt them all to make copper sheets."

Sheathing the bottoms of all ships with copper sheets wasn't difficult in craftsmanship itself. What the Planning Agency found throny was that copper, as a scarce metal in China, had truly limited stock in the warehouse. So much so that to meet future demand for electric power industry, the Planning Agency had to strictly restrict all places using copper materials. Even the wired telegraph system used iron wire. Copper was permitted only in irreplaceable places: including some refrigeration equipment, pipelines, telecommunication power equipment, and valves.

To expand copper reserves, the Planning Agency didn't hesitate to purchase Japanese copper at high prices in Guangdong in the past. This copper brought them high economic benefits—about 20% silver could be extracted from it, but the increase in copper reserves was very limited.

Now using copper to sheath ship bottoms, whether the stock copper was enough, and how much reserve could be left, was what the Planning Agency was eager to know.

The copper stored by the Planning Agency was mostly red copper refined by pyrometallurgy, also brass and bronze. The latter two mainly came from various spoils of war. Red copper had excellent ductility, second only to gold and silver among all metals. The Planning Agency believed that if copper plates could be made very thin, perhaps a small amount of copper could meet the demand.

"No need to use red copper." Ji Wusheng said at the planning meeting, "Using brass is enough. According to materials provided by the Great Library, copper plates for sheathing ship bottoms are generally Tin Brass. Adding a small amount of tin to brass."

Brass itself is a copper-zinc alloy. Zinc was used in large quantities in ancient China, especially in coin casting; zinc was often used as a filler. So in the Planning Agency's non-ferrous metal inventory, zinc stock was considerable. Much wasn't even purchased intentionally but was a byproduct extracted from recycling copper coins and various household metal objects.

According to Ji Wusheng's suggestion, a type of brass specifically for sheathing ship bottoms was manufactured, with a proportion roughly 65% copper and 35% zinc. The so-called Alpha Brass. This could maximize the reduction of red copper consumption while maintaining basic performance.

"If zinc content in brass is too high, brittleness increases, making it difficult to process with pressure. So 35% zinc is about right."

Brass itself has quite good ductility; modern industrial rolled brass strips can reach 0.02mm thickness. Lingao's industrial system didn't have such powerful equipment, but machinery department people estimated that with existing processing capability, rolling to about 0.5mm wasn't a problem. This was much thinner than the copper sheets used by the British back then; the British basically used thin copper plates.

"Adding 0.5% tin to Alpha Brass makes Tin Brass. This alloy has very good heat resistance and corrosion resistance against seawater, so-called Naval Brass."

Tin was also the most commonly used base metal in ancient China; the Planning Agency's stock was even more than zinc. Moreover, the usage amount was negligible.

The Planning Agency approved the production plan for Tin Brass strips. Within Lingao's iron and steel complex, there was a very small-scale rolling mill, including 2 hot rolling mills, which could conveniently hot and cold roll various steel plates and strip steel. However, Zhan Wuya decided to specialize in imitating a dedicated rolling mill for production—after all, continuous production in steel manufacturing would be a trend in the future; it was impossible to stop machines temporarily to switch production just to roll copper strips today.

A rolling mill, simply put, is a series of rollers with pressure from small to large. The most critical parts are the rollers' own strength and power level. Neither was difficult for the Manufacturing Directorate, which could already mass-produce high-power steam engines and high, medium, and low carbon steel of various grades.

The only less ideal things were transmission gears and chains; so far, the quality of these things still didn't pass muster, and working life was very short. In some equipment with harsh working environments, replacement frequency was extremely fast, only barely solving the problem of existence. The Metallurgy Department's scrap recycling warehouse was piled with gears, bearings, and chains waiting to be remelted.

The rolling mill for producing copper plates was quickly manufactured with the cooperation of people from the Ministry of Mechanical Industry. After brief debugging, it entered formal production. To ensure strength, although 0.1mm brass strips were rolled in trial production, the copper plates finally decided to be used on ship bottoms were still 1mm thick strip material.

Rolls of Tin Brass strips were transported to the shipyard. They were cut according to certain sizes, then hammered piece by piece into the ship bottom by workers using special brass rivets, overlapping copper pieces to ensuring no wooden ship bottom was exposed. The copper sheathing area had to cover the full load waterline of the ship. This method could almost completely prevent shipworm destruction, and even attachments like barnacles would be drastically reduced.

To prevent electrolysis between copper and iron in seawater, when sheathing the bottom, exposed iron frame parts on the ship bottom must be covered with wooden cladding boards beforehand, then filled and isolated using a mixture of human hair and tar to ensure no electrochemical reaction occurred between the two. Even rudder bolts had to be switched to brass bolts to avoid being electrolyzed.

A wooden sailing ship with carefully treated timber and a copper-sheathed bottom could last 50-70 years under good regular maintenance. Even 100 years was no problem. Although Senators wouldn't necessarily need the 854 Modified to serve that long, everyone expected it to last at least 10 years. Even if not as a warship, it could be used as a transport ship.

Regarding steam engines, the Ministry of Mechanical Industry had sufficient technical reserves to mass-produce 12hp, 50hp, 100hp, 200hp, and 500hp steam engines—Zhan Wuya, following Wang Luobin's standardization system construction requirements, mandated that steam engines adopt fully standardized designs. Parts that could be universal were all manufactured according to unified standards and sizes. And trying to reduce tolerances as much as possible—the latter was the goal the entire Lingao industrial system was diligently striving for.

Marine steam engines differ greatly from ordinary land-use steam engines due to ship layout and propulsion methods. The Ministry of Mechanical Industry also had to develop two different steam engines to adapt to paddle wheels—so-called sidewheel propulsion—and propeller propulsion respectively.

"To be honest, developing marine steam engines is not a problem." Xiao Gui studied the line drawing of the 854 Modified, "The problem is, what about the propeller?"

The benefit of paddle wheels lies in simple structure and no sealing problems in installation. 854 Modified prepared to use a propeller, which involved the dynamic sealing problem of the propeller shaft.

"This problem is very hard to solve; at least I can't think of how to solve it." Xiao Gui said, "There are several ways for dynamic sealing; thinking back and forth, only the packing method works, stuffing non-combustible packing with certain water-absorbing swelling properties around the propeller shaft."

"I recall there's something specific about this rotating shaft." Meng De suddenly remembered, "I heard old workers at the shipyard brag that older ships in the past used Lignum Vitae bearings. This special wood bearing is extremely hard, doesn't need oil for lubrication but relies on water lubrication; friction with the shaft produces a smooth water-soluble substance. It can both lubricate the bearing and ensure water doesn't enter the cabin through the shaft sleeve. Heard him say Lignum Vitae bearings must be kept wet during storage, otherwise drying cracks will affect usage. Very expensive."

"Lignum Vitae (Iron Pear Wood)? This sounds so familiar. Seem to have it in our ship timber reserves." Zhan Wuya remembered; among the ship timber captured from Baitu Village was so-called *Tieli Mu* (Iron Power Wood or Ironwood), wondering if it was the same thing.
