# Chapter 287: Sweet Port Turbulence — The Silver from Guangzhou

At the villa, Chu Yu removed her rain cape and hung it under the eaves, then hurried back to unfasten the buttons of his rain jacket. Wu De saw that beneath it, her blue cloth dress was completely soaked, covered with mud. Her legs were bare—just a pair of muddy feet now. Her hair was plastered into wet strands, her lips blue with cold, her body shivering. But on her back was a bundle.

"What are you doing here? I told you I was going on a business trip!" Though moved, Wu De couldn't help scolding her for the sentimentality. "Coming out in this heavy rain—trying to get sick?" But there was already affection in his words.

"I was born a servant—where would I get such delicate sensibilities?" Chu Yu didn't seem to mind. She ignored her own wet clothes. She took down the bundle from her back. "I saw Master forgot this. Since you're on a business trip, you'll certainly be going to territory under the officials' control. So I hurried to bring it."

Opening it, he found a dark stab-resistant vest. In the past, whenever Wu De went to the countryside or the quarantine camp, he'd wear this for protection as long as the weather permitted. Recently, as conditions had improved and the weather had grown hot, he rarely wore it anymore.

"Master always wears this protective garment when going on business trips. I saw you forgot it and rushed over." Chu Yu beamed. "I thought I wouldn't make it in time. Didn't expect Master hadn't left yet. Put it on."

"Well—" Wu De was caught between laughter and tears. Wearing this thing today wouldn't matter, but once the sun came out, he'd cook to death. Still, Chu Yu's heartfelt concern touched him deeply.

"Alright, I'll bring it along."

"Remember to wear it—"

"I'll remember." Wu De decided to be agreeable all the way. "You should hurry back now. I'll be setting out in a moment."

"Master," Chu Yu dried her dripping hair, gave it a gentle toss, and nestled into Wu De's embrace, saying softly, "Master, please come back safe and sound—"

Wu De felt a warmth in his heart. Nothing pleased a man more than having a woman devote herself to him completely as her anchor—even if she wasn't beautiful.

"I'm just going to Guangzhou to do business, not into mountains of swords or seas of fire. What are you afraid of!" Wu De scolded her gently.

"What Master does is rebellion." Chu Yu looked up at him, her not-large eyes clear and bright. "Guangzhou isn't like Lingao—it's under the officials' jurisdiction. Please be careful in everything, Master. Chu Yu wants to serve Master for a lifetime."

Wu De had wanted to reassure her and deny the whole rebellion thing, but on second thought—why deceive himself? So he nodded solemnly.

The *Ascending Peace Island* left port, heading northwest toward Guangzhou Bay. An hour later, Bopu Port had vanished below the horizon. Only the lighthouse at Lingao Point could still be faintly seen.

As evening approached, the wind grew even more violent, now mixed with rain. Wu De checked his watch: 17:05, but the sky was already as dark as dusk. The sea was rough, and the 70-ton *Ascending Peace Island* bobbed like a leaf, appearing and disappearing among the waves.

Wu De sat in the captain's cabin, watching the sea through the glass window. The *Ascending Peace Island* was a converted fishing boat; its living quarters weren't particularly comfortable. The so-called captain's cabin naturally had no leather high-back chair—just a rattan chair fixed to the deck. That counted as the captain's throne.

"Sir, the rain is too heavy. It's dark—can't see a thing. Should we stop and put in somewhere?" The first mate walked into the cabin to report to Wu De. His rain cape and bamboo hat were completely soaked, his lips blue with cold.

This first mate had been promoted from among their captured pirates. His surname was Wang, and because of his thick beard, everyone called him Wang the Bearded. Wang the Bearded had originally been a small boat owner with his own two-masted vessel, doing coastal trade and transport. Until one day he was robbed by the Red Hairs at sea, leaving him with nothing. So he'd simply became a pirate—unfortunately, on his very first raid with his bosses, he'd been wiped out by the transmigrators. Pulled from the sea with a belly full of water, Wang the Bearded had been left on the beach to die. A transmigrator from the Navy, seeing his good physique and figuring he'd make a useful laborer, charitably hung him upside down to drain the water and saved his life.

After months of honest stone-breaking and ditch-digging in the labor reform brigade, he'd passed the preliminary political screening. The assessment concluded that Wang the Bearded had been a pirate only briefly, hadn't developed deep bandit habits, and had few connections to pirate networks—qualifying him as "usable and reformable." Since he was also familiar with the coastal routes, he'd been recruited by the Navy. After several months of service, having passed a second secret political review by the Political Security Directorate, his trust level was upgraded to Grade IIB, and he was appointed first mate on the *Ascending Peace Island*.

"Have a drink to warm up first." Wu De unslung his canteen and handed it over. "What's our speed?"

The first mate took the liquor, tilted his head back for a big gulp, then said, "Seven to eight-point-five knots."

This was the speed with the diesel engine running—under these sea conditions, the engine's power was very useful for effective ship handling.

"Wind strength?"

"20 knots."

So it seemed the rain was heavy, but the wind hadn't increased. This relieved Wu De slightly, but the barometer showed no signs of improvement.

"Can't stop the ship. We need to sail day and night to make it in time," Wu De said. "Split the sailors and marines into two shifts for sleeping in rotation."

"Yes, sir—I'll go arrange it!" Wang the Bearded wiped his mouth and hurried out again.

After arranging matters, Wu De put on his seaman's cap, fastened his rain jacket, and climbed up to the aft castle. The six trainees on their first voyage were curled up on the aft castle deck, vomiting. Several were already deathly pale.

Seeing their commanding officer approach, the trainees struggled to stand up. Wu De stopped them. "Grab a rope and stand! First learn to keep your feet on deck!"

"Yes, sir!" The one in front managed a salute.

"Split into two shifts. First shift watch the surrounding waters. Second shift help with pumping on deck!" He gave the trainees their orders.

He walked to the forward railing of the aft castle, wanting to observe the conditions in the distance. The wind seemed to have strengthened. The rain was so heavy he could barely keep his eyes open. Raindrops pelted his face like a torrent. Wu De wiped his face, steadied his footing on the deck, and used his binoculars to observe the sea—in the murky darkness, only vague patches of light and shadow were visible.

The cold rain soon numbed all his skin. The cold accelerated his fatigue, and he began to grow hazy. Wu De hastily shook his head to clear it, then returned to the captain's cabin to study the charts under the swaying lantern light.

It had to be said that night sailing in this era, with virtually no navigational facilities, in a ship without radar, GPS, or gyrocompass, was extremely dangerous. Wu De had chosen a route on the chart that was safest and least likely to encounter rocks or shoals, but the danger of grounding remained ever-present.

"Sir! Wind's too strong—the sails can barely take it. Rain's too heavy—water's coming into the lower hold faster! If we wait any longer, the weather might get worse." Wang the Bearded walked into the cabin to report. His rain cape had been torn apart by the wind and rain.

"Sea conditions?"

"Wind 25 knots, wave height 3.3 meters!"

"Order! Lower sails! Secure all lines! Maintain course!" Wu De commanded.

"Lower sails! Secure lines! Maintain course! Yes, sir." The first mate saluted and turned to leave.

"Marine squad leader! Have your men work in five-man shifts. All pumps running—help with drainage! Non-essential personnel, everyone below deck!" Wu De set down his dividers and gave the order.

"Yes, sir!"

Wu De stepped out of the cabin. The deck was alive with activity. Sailors in short pants, barefoot, were lowering sails, tightening cables, covering cargo. Marines in long pants with blue armbands on their left arms were busy pumping water.

Just then, a wave lifted the bow high. Seeing it, Wu De immediately shouted, "Hold on!!! Hold on!!!"

Before he finished speaking, the ship plunged into the trough. Seawater swept across the entire deck.

Wu De was also knocked down. He quickly grabbed a rope and struggled to his feet, shouting, "Count heads! Report losses!!!"

"Sailors—no casualties!!!" "Marines—no casualties!!" "Forward hatch damaged!! Taking water!!" "Midship hold—taking water!!"

"Forward hold—plug the leak! Midship hold—pump!" Wu De shouted orders. The wind mixed with rain had already made his voice hoarse.

"Man overboard!!!" Along with a sharp whistle blast, the stern lookout gave the alarm.

This is bad. Wu De looked at the trainees pumping on deck—only one remained.

Wu De ran to the stern. Following the direction indicated by the lookout, he saw two figures floating face-down in the water about 100 meters from the stern.

"Sir, do we rescue them?" asked the first mate, who'd rushed over.

"How? In these seas? Besides, those two kids are already gone. Their first time at sea..." Wu De said angrily. "Go—get the rest of those boys down to the mid-hold! Ah..."

At midnight, the wind raged and rain lashed. Wu De went down to the mid-hold. Off-duty sailors and marines were gathered together, eating. The four surviving trainees were huddled in a corner, quietly sobbing.

Wu De sat down beside them and asked, "You all know now?"

The four said nothing, just kept crying.

"The sea is like this. You've only seen her calm side. Today's waves weren't even the worst."

"Not even the worst—dear heaven..." One trainee stopped crying and looked at Wu De.

"That's right. Look at them over there—not bothered at all." Wu De pointed at the sailors eating and joking. "The sea can only be conquered by those of us who don't fear hardship or death. Only by going through this can you become real men. If you want to become naval officers who rule the seas, you have to be able to endure this suffering."

"I don't want to be a naval officer anymore, boo-hoo..." This one crying with snot running was probably fourteen or fifteen—clearly in shock.

Wu De sighed and said, "Get some rest first. In two hours, you're back on watch! Anyone who doesn't want to be a naval trainee—I'll arrange your withdrawal when we get back!"

With that, he left the youngsters and returned to the captain's cabin.

Back in the captain's cabin, Wu De started to eat dinner.

Dinner was simple: just four rice cakes, one dried fish, one pomelo, and a cup of water. Wu De sandwiched the dried fish between rice cakes and, washing it down with water, chewed with effort. These damned field rations!

A night of wind and rain, and the next day at dawn, the sky began to brighten. The wind and rain had subsided considerably. The *Ascending Peace Island* finally resumed normal sailing and arrived at Guangzhou Bay early on the morning of the third day.

The handover point was at the Guangzhou docks. Qiwei Escort Agency personnel provided escort the entire way, mobilizing almost half the agency's manpower—by now, Qiwei had become effectively a subsidiary of the Guangzhou Station, with two-thirds of its business serving the Station.

Zhang Xin came to the dock and supervised loading the iron chests containing fifty thousand *liang* of silver onto the ship.

"This is fifty thousand. We're in contact with the Gao family to raise more cash, but funds are hard to mobilize right now..." Zhang Xin reported.

"This tight? Doesn't the Gao family owe us over a hundred thousand in payments?"

"The Gao family's not the only one. Our accounts receivable are close to one hundred eighty thousand," Zhang Xin said. "But by convention, the first settlement isn't until the fifth day of the fifth lunar month. Merchants with goods out haven't collected payment yet. It's the same everywhere—nobody can produce much cash. The lending interest rates on the Guangzhou market are very high right now. Even if the Gao family can scrape together tens of thousands of *liang*, we'll have to pay interest—just less than the going rate."

"How high?" Wu De knew the Executive Committee was still worrying about where to find more silver.

"The going market rate is twenty percent a month. The Gao family would probably accept fifteen percent."

"Monthly interest of twenty percent?!" Wu De nearly shouted. This loan-sharking was ridiculous. Annual rate was 240%!

"Even at this interest rate, as long as we complete the cargo turnaround within a month, we'll still make money. On sugar, whether it's English or Portuguese buyers, they're willing to pay cash. If it really comes to that, we can consider such short-term borrowing!" Zhang Xin pulled a copy of a document from his pocket. "This is another proposal from the Guangzhou Station to the Executive Committee. It's a bigger matter and might be too slow to save the immediate crisis. But if we can implement it, future cash flow will be much more comfortable. The telegram's already been sent—the Executive Committee should discuss it soon."

"Good, I'll take a look. If it's feasible, I'll send a telegram directly recommending the Executive Committee adopt it."

Time was pressing. The *Ascending Peace Island* didn't linger in Guangzhou. After loading the silver and making some minor ship repairs, they replenished their fresh water and immediately set off for Leizhou.

On the ship, Wu De opened the copy. It was a document drafted by the Guangzhou Station—a proposal jointly signed by the Station's three main commercial officers, suggesting that the Station's subordinate enterprises accept deposits from the families of officials and wealthy households in Guangzhou and throughout Liangguang and Fujian.

"Deposits?!" Wu De was so startled he jumped out of his chair. Only four words came to mind: "Pure fantasy!"
