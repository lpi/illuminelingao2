# Chapter 159: Rifles and Cannons

Finally, 1kg mercury produced ~1.2kg fulminate. Chemistry-Group was very satisfied. After all, each percussion-cap used minimal-fulminate.

Percussion-caps for Minié-rifles were best made of copper. Transmigrators brought no copper. Guangzhou Forward-Station purchased large-quantities of Japanese red-copper ingots—highly-sought because they contained considerable-silver. Extracting silver would offset copper-purchase costs.

Metallurgy-Group re-refined copper-ingots—obtaining high-purity copper and some silver. With materials-solved, Mechanical-Group designed/built a specialized percussion-cap stamping-machine, manufactured dies, electric-powered—pressing 10 caps per-cycle.

After confirming batch-production, rifle-assembly began. These Minié-ball muzzle-loaders used 14mm alloy-steel seamless-tubes from pre-departure purchase of high-pressure boiler-pipes. After purchase, they'd secretly machined 48cm-length 5-groove "internal-threads" at Zhan Wuya's machine-shop. Hammers, triggers, springs—also stamped from 4–5mm alloy-steel-plate at his shop. Without this preparation—if self-machining rifling—they'd barely have rifles now. New Army would've used Brown-Besses. Smoothbores were championed by some line-infantry purists. Wang Luobin, though a line-infantry enthusiast, wasn't fundamentalist enough. True purists absolutely-rejected rifled-muskets.

Rifled-muskets weren't new. Flintlock-era already had rifled-flintlocks. Compared to smoothbores, rifled-benefits were obvious: longer-range, higher-accuracy. Against smoothbore-flintlocks' sub-50m effective-range, muzzle-loading rifles could serve as sniper-rifles for their era.

Why weren't they widespread? First: complex-manufacturing, high-cost. Second: difficult-loading. Rifled-accuracy came from bullets rotating along grooves—requiring bullets embedded in rifling. Without Minié-balls, bullets had to be slightly-larger than bore-diameter, forcibly-deformed into rifling. Exaggeratedly: hammered in. Though not usually that extreme—loading was slower than smoothbores. So despite some countries equipping elite-infantry, widespread-adoption didn't happen.

Minié-balls changed muzzle-loader destiny. Minié-balls: conical-projectiles slightly smaller than bore-diameter—easy loading. Base had conical-cavity with wooden-plug. Firing-gas pressed plug into cavity, expanding base to engage-rifling, sealing bore, enabling spin. Minié-balls solved muzzle-loader loading-difficulty and smoothbore accuracy/range problems—making rifles surpass cannons as battlefield-decisive weapons.

Trigger-pull—*BANG*—rifle-recoil jolted shoulder painfully. Wang Luobin's shoulder ached from impact. Faint-smoke dissipated from muzzle. 100m distant beneath fortress-wall, Jiang Ye ran from shelter, checked target, pasted white-paper over new-hole, shouted into bamboo-tube telephone. Wang Luobin removed right-earplug, listened at his bamboo-tube: "9-ring—7 o'clock deviation." Waved acknowledgment.

Excellent result! First-shot very near bullseye—this rifle would calibrate within two-hours. Taking small-file, he shaved a thin-layer off brass-sight's left-side. Then loosened barrel-clamp, loaded powder and ball, carefully re-aimed at 100m half-body-target. Another 100m calibration. Luck was excellent—everything normal. After 100m, different-height targets simulated 200m, 300m, 400m distances. Beyond—soldier's luck.

This rifle took only 40 minutes—excellent accuracy. Perfect masterpiece. Estimated 300m could drop individual-cavalry. Finally, branding-iron marked his-initials on stock's upper-rear-edge, adding "J+" below indicating sniper-grade. After all, Minié-rifles only required 60% hits on 20-foot-wide, 8-foot-tall targets at 400-yards.

Looking at board with 4 *zheng*-characters scratched in charcoal, Wang Luobin heavily-added stroke to fourth. Nearby, Zhan Wuya's group also finished their fourth. Today's 50-rifle quota seemed no-problem—likely exceeding.

3,000 steel-tubes plus components made 3,000 rifles. Plus ~1,000 spare-parts. However, two weeks ago, Industrial-Department decided cutting 20 tubes into ~2-inch sections for Derringer-pistol production. Though losing 20 rifles—short-barreled weapons equipped Navy, Intelligence, and other departments needing compact self-defense. No intention of issuing GLOCKs to natives.

Though rifles assembled quickly—80+ daily—without rigorous-calibration, rifles given to rookies who'd barely fired live-rounds weren't much better than flintlock-poles. Externally-strong, internally-weak—described transmigrators' current-predicament.

Only after 600+ rifles did Industrial-Group reduce daily-quota slightly—taking time for precision-calibration and selecting accuracy-rifles. Percussion-caps were carefully-stockpiled for combat. This related to General-Staff's operational-doctrine. Given future-enemies' enormous-numbers—whether Ming-forces or pirates—1,000+ was routine. Transmigrators' operations had expanded—turtle-defense would create everywhere-defended-everywhere-passive situations. Military-doctrine: strike outward—deploy infiltration-forces in perimeter for cold-shooting, mining, harassing enemy-movements and logistics. Such tactics required precision-rifles for frontline-units. After all, longer-range shooting benefited infiltration-survival. One-shot-downing cavalry or officers clearly-reduced frontal-engagement pressure.

Days ago, summary-meeting's Intelligence-Department reported: major-battle within one-month. Whether pirates or Ming—transmigrators faced 2,000–3,000 attackers. If Ming—mainland might continuously-reinforce. Without heavily-defeating Ming-forces or annihilating portions—siege could last one-two months. So Industrial-Department's burden suddenly increased. Besides 50 daily-rifles—needed combat-ammunition-stockpiling. Metallurgy-Department smelted steel, also mass-refining copper and lead. Casting-molds mass-produced Minié-balls and round iron-shot. 3,000+ Minié-balls and 250 round-shot daily. With stockpiled-ammunition—several-day battle at 30–40 rounds daily per-rifle was manageable.

Artillery-side: Foundry had delivered 9 × 8-pounder smoothbores. With familiar-processes, casting-smoothbores was routine. Rear-loading-cannons initially had difficulty machining breech-blocks—one qualified-block took 3-days. First-week: only 2 cannons. But after collective-analysis, Mechanical-Group improved processes: cut steel-plates, don't rush welding—first grind end-faces and weld-steps on foot-pedal-grinders. Then use local-granite slabs as jig-frames for welding. Now: 6 × 70mm Armstrong-guns completed. 12-pounder mountain-howitzers were simpler—with sufficient pig-iron, one daily. Already delivered: 14 × 12-pounder mountain-howitzers.

With increasing cannon-production, Mechanical-Group mastered manufacturing-processes, work-hours, and component-dimensions for each type. Designed/manufactured specialized-dies and tooling. Using imported-measurement-tools, they quickly minimized tolerances—establishing manufacturing-standards for each cannon-type, beginning standardized-production. Every cannon's parameters matched same-type guns identically.

With standardized-production—same-type cannons had nearly-identical performance. Artillery-Group test-fired every cannon-batch—measuring firing-parameters: based on shell-type and target-distance, determine charge-amount and barrel-elevation. When necessary, Artillery-Group conducted dangerous maximum-safe-rate, barrel-life, and maximum-charge experiments—testing cannon-potential.

Test-and-calculation results became firing-tables. Tables only needed four-parameters. Book-format for quick-reference by gunners. Could even skip text—just graphics (shell-types) and numbers.

If gunners did all this—they'd need mathematics, geometry, even algebra mastery. Hence early-era gunners were half-foundrymen, half-mathematicians. That's "artillery needs high-tech personnel" origin. But this wasn't inevitable—just conceptual-backwardness. With standardized-guns and tables—gunners didn't need sophistication. Just recognizing numbers/graphics, few-hundred characters sufficed. Dramatically-reduced training-difficulty. Theoretically—illiterates could serve. Very-suitable for transmigrators' societal-environment.

As transmigrators, they possessed not just modern-technology—but centuries of accumulated advanced-concepts. Sometimes concepts exceeded technology's effectiveness.
