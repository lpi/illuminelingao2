# Chapter 1795 - The Mystery

The murderer was not only meticulous in thought throughout the entire process, but also ingenious in design. His actions were even more composed and self-possessed. He could return to collect the corpse after the patrol officers discovered and abandoned it, continuing with the original plan; even when fleeing in panic, he didn't forget to use the special design of Zhenbo Garden's back door to re-lock it. The audacity of this person was evident.

Judging from his methods of hiding the corpse and disguising Wang Xiuzhu's death as suicide, this person was very familiar with the case-handling ideas and methods of traditional government offices. Either he was an old hand in the *jianghu* with a long criminal record, or he himself had once been a constable in the government office.

Judging from the fact that the murderer didn't touch the silver at Widow Wang's home, this person didn't kill for money. Habitual criminals who kill for money wouldn't painstakingly dispose of the corpse; the various means he adopted were all striving to cover up the case.

The murderer's familiarity with the route and the Shan-Shaan Guild Hall suggested he should be a local or someone who had lived in Guangzhou for a long time.

Criminal police roughly sketched the image of the murderer based on various clues they collected: young male, age between 25-30, beardless, scholarly appearance, judging from behavior likely a scholar. Height between 160-165 cm, foot length about 24 cm. Agile, possibly possessing martial arts skills. Speaks Guangzhou Mandarin, familiar with the local situation, very likely lives in Guangzhou.

With only this image, it was naturally impossible to issue a wanted notice for arrest. The criminal police needed more clues. At this time, the coroner's autopsy report was delivered.

The coroners of Guangzhou's one prefecture and two counties were all retained—although their skills were crude and even full of errors and fallacies, at least they had accumulated experience over hundreds of years. Until their own forensic doctors were trained, they could only rely on these people temporarily.

Coroners not only belonged to the lowly status of lictors, but because of their work, everyone avoided them like the plague, so basically, the profession was passed down within the family for generations. Experience accumulation existed, but theoretical knowledge basically relied on a book called *Records of Washing Away of Wrongs*. Naturally, it couldn't meet the needs of criminal investigation work. Especially the inability to dissect corpses greatly discounted the effect of corpse examination. For this reason, Liu San had to be invited to act as a forensic doctor to perform the dissection.

The autopsy report delivered now was such a mixed report that had undergone double examination. The conclusion was that the deceased was a middle-aged man, with no clothing remaining on the corpse, age roughly between forty and fifty, short and fat stature, delicate skin on hands and feet, wealthy life, not from a laboring class background. What was most shocking was that the deceased's genitals had actually been cut off completely by someone, the technique clean and neat—the report noted: cut off after death.

Wu Xiang was startled when he read this. The deceased even had his genitals cut off—what a great hatred this must be! Looking further down, the cause of death was decapitation. However, the dissection results found a large amount of alcohol remaining in his stomach. Combined with the fact that there was no external trauma on the corpse, he should have been killed after being forced to get drunk.

"I see, this is undoubtedly a 'flower case' (sex-related crime)." Gao Chongjiu had no success in pursuing the Tanka boats and rushed back to the bureau after receiving notification that the corpse had been found.

The murderer cut off the genitals after chopping off the victim's head—if the deceased was a child, it might be that human traffickers cut them off to make medicine for sorcery, but the victim was a middle-aged man. Such behavior had no other reasonable explanation except involving a romantic case.

Wu Xiang and Li Zhenguo also agreed with his view. The problem was what kind of romantic case could provoke the murderer to first behead and then castrate the deceased. Such deep hatred, perhaps only levels like killing one's father, snatching one's wife, or wiping out one's son would qualify.

"Could it be done by the kin of Wang Xiuzhu's late husband?" Li Zhenguo put forward his view, "We can start from here..."

"If her late husband still had kin, Wang Xiuzhu would have been married back by someone long ago. Even if she was unwilling, this house would absolutely not be allowed for her to live in."

In poor families, a wife was also property, let alone she was originally bought. If Wang Xiuzhu's man had died without children, if her man still had brothers in the clan, they would inevitably marry her back to solve the bachelor problem. Even if they didn't marry her, selling or pawning her could always exchange for some money. As for this house, it was even more impossible to leave it to such a lonely and helpless widow like her.

"So her late husband couldn't have had clan brothers locally, otherwise would they allow her to live freely alone?" Gao Chongjiu said, "Besides, kin catching adultery is for money, not to the extent of killing the adulterer—and attacking so ruthlessly."

Wu Xiang thought for a while and said: "One point can be affirmed, the murderer shouldn't be Wang Widow's lover, or rather, not that lover living in her house."

The evidence was obvious. The men's clothes searched from Wang Xiuzhu's house completely didn't match the suspect's body type but were similar to the victim's, indicating these clothes belonged to the victim. Additionally, undigested food was extracted from the victim's stomach through dissection, and many kinds of food were related to the leftovers found at the scene. This indicated the victim had dinner at Wang Xiuzhu's house.

"Sister-in-law Liu said the suspect came late and left early, which indicates the suspect didn't live in Widow Wang's house. Evidence from the scene also proves he didn't live in Wang Xiuzhu's house regularly. But the situation provided by Old Cui indicates someone indeed lived in her house—the one living permanently at the Wang house should be the victim. But the suspect was very familiar with Widow Wang, and it's also a fact he stayed overnight at her house. I think they were likely acquainted or even familiar. As to what exactly the relationship between the three was, I think it's worth exploring."

"Could it be 'one woman two husbands', causing jealousy and fighting?" Gao Chongjiu said.

"Fighting out of jealousy is possible, 'one woman two husbands' doesn't quite make sense." Wu Xiang said, "'One woman two husbands' is a last resort method for poor people who can't afford a wife. Neither the victim nor the suspect look like poor people, not to the extent of making do like this. To say Wang Xiuzhu was having it both ways, I think the possibility is also very small. After all, she was a woman of ordinary appearance, not young anymore, where would she get such great charm?"

Everyone felt Wu Xiang spoke reasonably.

"Our urgent task now is still to figure out who exactly the victim was." When Wu Xiang said this, he had no confidence in his heart. His teacher Chief Mu had said that murder case investigation work was most afraid of encountering corpses found in the wild without a stitch of clothing, because such corpses were very difficult to identify.

In the old timeline, police using a series of technological means like household registration, missing persons databases, fingerprint and DNA databases, facial reconstruction, etc., had a great probability of figuring out the specific identity of nameless bones. But in the 17th century, except for the household registration system just established, there was nothing. In this timeline, no one reported missing persons because the yamen didn't manage missing persons cases. To figure out how many people went missing recently, one could only mobilize the Baojia forces to investigate one by one. The workload was huge, and it might not necessarily be found.

Wu Xiang didn't know so much high technology, but he knew that just in the mortuary set up by the Police Bureau outside the city, there were dozens of corpses with suspicious causes of death waiting to be identified and claimed.

Gao Chongjiu was an old hand at official business, naturally knowing the difficulty inside. He thought for a while and said: "I think we should still start from the items the lover left at Widow Wang's place. Her dressing box is from Purple Treasure Studio, the clerk might remember who bought it. Also that ring, the clothes left behind can all be checked."

Wu Xiang knew this was the only way, and agreed immediately. They divided the work to investigate. Because criminal police manpower was insufficient, Li Ziyu and Zhao Gui were also temporarily transferred to "assist with work".

Gao Chongjiu's job was to use his old connections in the lower class to investigate if there were any young people fitting the suspect's characteristics recently. If this person indeed came from "the Jianghu", it was impossible for there to be no news at all among the city foxes and society rats.

Ordinary constables in the government office would master a group of so-called "ears and eyes", which in modern times would be called "informants". Gao Chongjiu had been an old hand at official business for decades and was sworn brothers with the head of the Guan Di Temple (Beggars' Sect/Gangs). He had a very high status in the gray world of Guangzhou City and controlled quite a few ears and eyes under his hand. He sat for a while in the teahouse he often went to, and before long he connected with a few main ears and eyes.

Based on his experience, a major case like the one that happened in South Scissors Alley would spread throughout the city in a few days, and there would be some useful news among the city foxes and society rats more or less.

However, when he asked about the headless case in South Scissors Alley, these few ears and eyes all said in unison that there was no news.

This abnormal situation attracted his attention. He asked again if they had heard news of a young man similar to the suspect recently. The ears and eyes again said in unison no. A few said they would go back and ask around, but Gao Chongjiu, having a sharp eye, knew at a glance they were perfunctorily dealing with him.

"Could it be Boss Gao issued a gag order?" Gao Chongjiu muttered secretly. This was a rare occurrence. Although the Guan Di Temple people had monstrous power in Guangzhou City, they still adhered to the principle of "not fighting against power". Generally, they didn't do things like murder for money. If the government had a case to pursue, they would cooperate as much as possible. If it really involved important figures of their own family, they would secretly "negotiate terms" with the constables and throw out a few scapegoats—in short, let both the constables and the government save face.

Gao Chongjiu realized the complexity of the case—it seemed the matter was not just a simple murder case. He thought about it and decided to use other forces to investigate secretly, to see what tricks Gao Tianshi was playing.

As for Li Ziyu and Zhao Gui, they were assigned the most boring and tedious work, physical evidence screening.

Screening work wasn't hard, the key was to be careful. After Li Ziyu was assigned the work, the first thing he did was take the silver ingots found in Widow Wang's house to the smelting shop for investigation.

Silver ingots were actually not the official currency of the Great Ming, only a fait accompli recognized by officials. Therefore, although official ingots had the best quality and sufficient weight, the government did not monopolize the right to cast them. Any shop or individual could melt and cast silver ingots themselves. But this was professional work after all, so most people still handed this work to smelting shops to do.
