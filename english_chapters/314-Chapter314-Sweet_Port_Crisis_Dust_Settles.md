# Chapter 314 - Sweet Port Crisis: Dust Settles

Third Master Zhu laughed hideously and slammed the table: "Good! You have guts." Saying this, he picked up the porcelain bowl in front of him and smashed it viciously under the table.

With a "crash," shards flew, and the hurried footsteps of a crowd instantly rang out from the lower hall.

Twenty or thirty burly men surged out from the side rooms of the lower hall, each holding a wooden stick, their faces ferocious. These were the boat protection water braves recruited by Zhu An; many were former pirates or deserters from the imperial army. Third Master Zhu had intended to use these men to coerce everyone if the meeting didn't go well—staging a "Banquet at Hongmen," not afraid that everyone wouldn't submit.

The main gate was slammed shut with a "clang."

The sugar merchants were dumbstruck with fear; some simply sat down hard back into their chairs. The atmosphere took a sharp turn for the worse. Wu Yi shut his mouth and quietly tried to slip away; Feng Guangfeng's face was pale, but he didn't move a muscle. Zhou Shizhai and Li Biao took a step forward, ready to valid Wen Tong and rush out.

"No need!" Although Wen Tong was a bit scared at this moment, his heart settled a lot, and he couldn't help but feel a sense of disdain. "Smashing a cup as a signal, hiding soldiers everywhere"—did he think this was a storytelling session?

Third Master Zhu laughed loudly: "Keep talking, keep talking! I should step back from the torrential current? Ask my brothers if they agree!"

Wen Tong's face was calm. He listened for a moment, then suddenly smiled:

"Everyone, stay calm. Just listen to the gongs on the street."

Hearing him say this, everyone pricked up their ears.

Sure enough, from afar came the sound of "Clang—Clang—Clang..." gongs. Seven beats a cycle. They were familiar with this gong sound: it was the clearing gong for the County Magistrate when he went out in procession. The gong sound came from far to near, obviously heading this way.

While they were hesitating, the main gate was banged loudly.

"Why is the door closed so tight in broad daylight! What tricks are you playing? I am Head Constable Li from the county yamen! Open the door!"

Zhu An's men who closed the door dared not keep it shut, and the burly men holding sticks had to scatter to the sides.

The door opened, and Head Constable Li ran in wearing his official uniform: "The County Magistrate has arrived. Manager Wen, quickly lead everyone to welcome him."

"Yes." Wen Tong cupped his hands. "Many thanks, Head Constable Li." As he spoke, Li Biao hurriedly went up and presented a heavy red envelope—inside was twenty taels of silver.

"The County Magistrate is here," Wen Tong said with a smile. "Take your men back, lest something happens later that can't be explained clearly—"

"Let's go welcome His Honor quickly," Wu Yi immediately proposed.

"Yes, yes, let's go quickly."

Wen Tong, however, didn't care and wasn't in a hurry to go out.

"Third Master Zhu," he said in a serene tone, "your jianghu tricks are useless. Unless you are prepared to fight a big battle right under the County Magistrate's nose. By then, even if you use your entire family fortune to buy his blindness, it won't work. You can't let this happen. And you have no way to 'restore' anything... Do you know the meaning of the word 'restore' (Fu Pi)? Looking at your face, I guess you probably don't...

"Restoration means restoring the old order, regaining the authority of your Haiyi Guild, and using this place to continue extracting maximum benefits for yourself. But those days are gone forever. Either you quietly take your belongings and get out; or you insist on being this titular Guild Master. If you want to do that, you can go ahead and call your men to attack, and see if the water braves you are so proud of are more formidable than Zhao Jijiao or Gu Dachun."

In the following few seconds, many things happened in rapid succession. A bodyguard beside Third Master Zhu suddenly pounced, attempting to restrain Wen Tong. But Zhou Shizhai was much faster, sweeping the opponent down with a leg sweep. Li Biao pounced and punched the man right in the Adam's apple, knocking him unconscious on the spot.

Another man drew a knife from his sleeve. Third Master Zhu screamed, "Don't use knives!"

Using knives was a felony violent crime, not to mention the place was full of witnesses and the County Magistrate was coming down the street. Using a knife here—even if the matter could be settled, it would cost a family fortune!

Before he could worry, the knife had just been extended when the man was punched in the neck by Zhou Shizhai's other hand and kicked in the lower abdomen. He slammed headfirst into the wall, bounced off, took two heavy blows to the stomach, and collapsed paralyzed.

Wen Tong was greatly relieved; Zhou Shizhai's martial arts were indeed not for show.

"Different people use different people." Wen Tong smiled. "Third Master Zhu, I wasn't wrong, was I?"

Third Master Zhu's prepared Hongmen Banquet ended just like that. Including his laughable stratagem—perhaps not outdated in 1629, but useless against an opponent with 400 years of advanced experience. Beiwei's team had already discovered the ambush during routine prior reconnaissance, and Chen Tianxiong had made timely arrangements based on this.

Outdated. Although his eyes were sharp enough to chop Wen Tong into minced meat, he still understood that those who understand the times are heroes. Zhu An's subordinates scattered completely in a moment. The scene was truly more dramatic than a play. Wen Tong let out a soft sigh of relief.

"Master Zhou has good kung fu."

"Call me Comrade." Zhou Shizhai patted the dust off his hands.

Zhu An and his gang left in embarrassment through the back door, and the magistrate's sedan chair arrived at the gate at this moment. Wen Tong straightened his clothes and went out respectfully to welcome him.

Inviting the County Magistrate to make a procession to the Haiyi Guild, sit with Wen Tong for a cup of tea, and exchange a few polite words cost Chen Tianxiong five hundred taels. Besides that, it also included a promise to increase the "regular fees" paid to the magistrate from the sugar industry by fifty percent annually. The price was high, but it was worth it.

The life of the Haiyi Guild ended on this day. The next day, the county yamen received two petitions: one was a joint application from the twenty member firms of the Haiyi Guild to dissolve the Haiyi Guild, and the other was naturally a joint application from Huanan and twenty industry peers to establish an Industry Guild. Under Huanan's active lobbying, this was already a matter of course. The county yamen quickly approved: "Granted as requested."

The plaque of the Haiyi Guild was taken down and immediately replaced with the plaque of the Leizhou Sugar Industry Guild.

The remaining assets were also entirely taken over by the Leizhou Sugar Industry Guild. According to Huanan's division of labor, the Sugar Industry Guild would be primarily the responsibility of Chang Shide. He immediately began liquidating the remaining assets of the Haiyi Guild. Wen Qing had already learned a lot of modern accounting knowledge, so he was responsible for clearing the accounts, assisted by a few clerks familiar with bookkeeping.

The silver and floating assets in the public account were all refunded to each firm according to their payment shares, including Zhu An's share. Chang Shide said that no matter how much Zhu An had embezzled or misappropriated public funds, he had after all done many things for the Leizhou sugar industry. "A person's merits and faults should be viewed with a split-one-into-two perspective." He said pretentiously. So the money due to him should not be a single coin less.

To show Huanan's absolute impartiality, Chang Shide invited five sugar merchants as supervisors through public election. The account clearing was completely public; a report was issued every week and sent to each sugar firm, detailing which accounts had problems and how they were handled. This practice of transparent accounts and clear organization won everyone's appreciation—Huanan's arrival brought a brand new atmosphere to the entire Leizhou sugar industry.

Originally, from the managers down to the servants in the Haiyi Guild, everyone was Third Master Zhu's private appointee: either distant relatives or fellow townsmen. This time, all were given severance pay and dismissed, not a single one kept. Those without local household registration were given extra travel expenses.

Originally, Chang Shide wanted to keep a few skilled hands, but Chen Tianxiong opposed it:

"Even if a few people are usable, they are related to Zhu An in some way. If we suspect a man, we don't use him; if we use a man, we don't suspect him. If we can't fully trust them, simply don't use them. Avoid inviting trouble."

"Just use them without suspicion. I don't believe these small figures can have deep affection for Zhu An?"

"Old Chang! As the saying goes, 'Righteousness is often found among dog butchers.'" Chen Tianxiong said. "They are all Zhu An's friends and old acquaintances. No matter how small, they were once beneficiaries and received Zhu An's favors. We cannot fail to guard against them."

In the end, everyone was dismissed with silver. These people also knew the trend was gone, took the money, and scattered without causing any incidents.

What Chang Shide found most thorny was the boat protection braves trained by the Haiyi Guild itself, numbering over thirty. This group was either pirates or deserters, with extremely bad habits. The Haiyi Guild used to support them with large amounts of silver—five taels a month, bonuses on three festivals, and extra "travel allowances" based on distance for every trip. Although their combat power was decent, they were arrogant soldiers spoiled by silver. Chang Shide had long known this group was hard to handle; hiring them would take a lot of effort to rectify, but not hiring them would make them a scourge.

Wu Yi, however, said: "Guild Master Chang need not worry about placing these people."

"Oh? Why?"

"They are all directly under Third Master Zhu's jurisdiction. We can't touch them at all." Wu Yi said that whether it was pay, supplies, or deployment, it was all handled by Third Master Zhu personally.

The money was paid by everyone, but they were actually Third Master Zhu's private retainers. Although theoretically shipping sugar out for sale was each firm's own business, if one didn't use the Zhu family's shipping line, it was very difficult to get protection braves to accompany the ship—they had to satisfy the needs of his family's ships first before it was the turn of other ships. For safety, everyone could only pay another shipping fee to Zhu An.

"This group has always only had Third Master Zhu in their eyes, not the Haiyi Guild. Let Third Master Zhu deal with them himself." Wu Yi laughed triumphantly.

Chang Shide thought, that's true. But if this group remained on Hai'an Street, they would still be a force in Third Master Zhu's hands. Zhu An hadn't used them before, but now it couldn't be ruled out that he might jump over the wall in desperation and let them come out to cause trouble. It was still necessary to eliminate this possible hidden danger as much as possible.

The rebuilding of Zou Monk's Temple was also announced by Chang Shide to everyone; the cost would be borne independently by Huanan. Peers originally thought they would be assessed another fee for this matter; seeing Huanan's stance, their goodwill increased a few points.

So soon a group of construction workers came from Lingao, set up reed mat walls around Zou Monk's Temple, and began major construction. It was said that because the project was huge and would take a long time, fearing the original temple sexton would lose his livelihood, Huanan specially renovated another small temple in the county town for him to preside over. The sexton, his wife, and the fire-tender Taoist moved away happily.

No one expected that the newly renovated Zou Monk's Temple would actually be the location of the future Xuwen Intelligence Station. Huanan also acquired a lot of wasteland around the temple, hired people to clear it, reportedly preparing to build a charity school and a benevolent hall. This action further left Huanan a reputation for being public-spirited and righteous in Xuwen and Leizhou.

One morning, as Feng Guangfeng was walking to a teahouse he frequented, someone saw him talking to a person not far from the teahouse. Then Feng Guangfeng got into a two-person small sedan chair and headed north.

The next morning, he was found by a water pond near Huanan, where the future workers' village was being built. He had been stabbed dozens of times, poked like a sieve, the method extremely savage. Obviously, the stabber was full of hatred for him. Only his face was intact, as if to make him easily identifiable. His mouth was stuffed full of granulated sugar, right down to his throat.

Zhu An died two days later. He had already moved out of Hai'an Street by then. After Riyicheng Sugar Firm ceased business, he moved to his own farm estate outside Haikang County seat; he still continued to operate the shipping line. That night, a big fire broke out in the estate. Including himself, no one in the Zhu family survived.

The storm on Hai'an Street thus came to an end in a tragic way. Hearing these news, the directors of the transformed Leizhou Sugar Industry Guild didn't know whether to be happy or sad. Many recalled the ups and downs the Haiyi Guild had gone through over thirty years, feeling mixed emotions. However, this world had ultimately started to change.

Feng Guangfeng's death was a huge blow to Huanan. Whether it was Wen Tong, Chen Tianxiong, or Chang Shide, they all had a great fondness for this "outsider" within the Haiyi Guild and had planned to use him heavily in the future, but unexpectedly he died just like that.

Chen Tianxiong blamed himself for a long time afterward for not paying attention to protecting the ally—they only thought Zhu An might retaliate against the transmigrators and their subordinates, never expecting he would choose to target Feng Guangfeng.

"This is because Feng Guangfeng was an outsider." Chen Tianxiong said. "He still couldn't bring himself to harm his fellow townsmen, nor did he dare to." He sighed, wondering if this cultural phenomenon was good or bad.

"There really aren't many good things among these sugar dogs. As soon as Feng Guangfeng died, not to mention anything else, they all thought about buying his firm. His child is young, and his woman can't show her face to manage business. It's clear they are preparing to bully the orphans and widow."

"And his clansmen from his wife's side, all want to take the opportunity to seize this property."

Hearing this, Wen Tong said seriously: "Richangji must continue. Huanan will maintain this firm for him!"

Chang Shide also said: "Right, he contributed the most to this matter; he can't end up with nothing. Otherwise, how will others look at us in the future?"

"I have three points." Chen Tianxiong said. "One, the Sugar Industry Guild will come forward to hold a grand public memorial service. Everyone in the guild will attend, giving him utmost posthumous glory; two, the silver for the seven thousand stone of sugar has been paid; the warehouse receipts must be handed to him as soon as possible to comfort his wife; three, select an honest and reliable clerk from his own firm to manage on his behalf. The Sugar Industry Guild will be responsible for supervising the operation."
