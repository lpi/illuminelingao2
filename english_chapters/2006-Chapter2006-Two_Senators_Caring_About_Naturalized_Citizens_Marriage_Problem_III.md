# Chapter 2006 - Two Senators Caring About Naturalized Citizens' Marriage Problem (III)

"Mm mm, and then? Where is source of women?"

"Look, your words are very incorrect. Would be criticized stinky by Female Senators upon First Reading in Senate." Wang Jun said. "Don't be so blunt. Even less mentioning gender problem. 'Wife of Naturalized Staff' must change to 'Spouse of Naturalized Staff'—Spouse can refer to male or female. Female Senators listening won't feel so ear piercing. And this proposal isn't servicing male staff only right?"

Du Yibin thought I can't handle these twists and turns. Looks like better going home raising chicken raising pangolin in future is serious business.

"As for spouse source you said: Female Prisoner need not think. Discussing in Senate will definitely lead to tearing c*nt [bitch fight]. Might tear for several months; Pure Chaste Hall is a reliable source. But number won't be many; As for importing women from abroad. You say India Vietnam both okay. But this matter needs Wudaokou approving—Spending money."

"So saying matter is hard to handle..." Du Yibin sat down depressingly instantly. "Morning Star" recently had articles regarding financial problem in several issues—Anyway meant "Difficult."

"So we must base on local!" Wang Jun took opportunity starting peddling his plan. "Guangzhou has good several hundreds of thousands population. Absolute number of appropriate age single women won't be small. We engage collective Blind Date more times. Will it not do? Don't say Little Zhang. Even Liu Xiang, Big Bosses of Senate also can't say a 'No' word. Look we are Marriage Autonomy, also Changing Wind Moving Custom [transforming social traditions], also solving staff life difficulty..."

"But what to do with disabled naturalized citizens?" Du Yibin hurried blocking his play. "Women in Blind Date can look upon them?"

"Boss! Marriage concept of this era is 'Marrying Han Marrying Han, Wearing Clothes Eating Rice' [Marrying a man for support]. To most middle lower class women. Choosing spouse mainly considers male economic ability. Not Little Fresh Meat [young handsome men]. Two Feelings Pleasing, Lad Talent Lady Appearance. That is for Ladies eating full to consider." Wang Jun said. "Disabled naturalized citizens as long as having suitable income. Naturally women will be willing to follow—Didn't Finance and Tax Mouth reply saying can give Special Subsidy to disabled naturalized citizen marriage?"

"Fine." Du Yibin was persuaded. "But which people willing to come? We can't go to street pulling women to Blind Date right."

"So you then stared at those female prisoners right?"

"Correct."

"Train of thought of Female Prisoner quite good. Just unrealistic. I feel you ignored a more realistic Big Resource."

"What?"

"Prostitutes."

"Prostitutes?" Du Yibin didn't expect in dream Wang Jun would propose such a suggestion. He shook head immediately disapproving. "You this is called unrealistic—Being prostitutes are all loving leisure hating labor. And their living standard: Wearing gold wearing silver. Eating fragrant drinking spicy. Still having maid old mommy serving. Self also like engaging some Zither Chess Calligraphy Painting. Don't say disabled naturalized citizens. Even Senators like us they may not look upon."

"You cannot take High Class Prostitutes like Dong Xiaowan as all of prostitutes." Wang Jun laughed. "Most prostitutes are still living in deep water scorching fire. Did you read 'Morning Star' of past few days?"

"Didn't read. What."

"There is a 'Guangzhou Wind Transformation Industry Rectification' report above. Inside did very detailed investigation. Especially mentioning although we allow prostitute 'Self Operation' now. Striking brothel evil forces. After rectifying operation environment. But among local prostitutes still have over seventy percent expressing hope to 'Follow Good' [leave trade]. And among remaining planning to continue being prostitutes. Many are because born in Music Household or Dan Household. No other livelihood means. If having suitable livelihood means then willing to seek other outlet. Truly wanting to do this trade. Probably less than one tenth."

"Such high ratio?"

"Correct." Wang Jun nodded. "I looked at statistics. Prostitutes currently holding Yellow Ticket in Guangzhou City probably have over one thousand five hundred. Even if seventy percent prostitutes plan to Follow Good. At least have one thousand."

"This... I feel isn't it somewhat..." Du Yibin said. "If prostitutes. Naturalized citizens willing to marry? This is 17th Century!"

"This spacetime I don't know. But in old timeline. After banning brothels in 50s. Most prostitutes liberated organized families. Regardless of what spacetime. Chastity View this thing only has market in middle upper society. Ordinary laborers can marry a wife is not bad. Not so particular."

After forming consensus. Both sides divided labor. Wang Jun responsible for persuading relevant leaders of Guangzhou City. Opening "Green Light" for Blind Date activity. Blind Date or Marriage. Both need investing venue and materials. Must obtain support of local real power holder. Wang Jun actually wasn't eloquent person. But he worked in Industrial Department. Also responsible for Steam Engine maintenance. Belonged to hard "Technical Cadre." Local Senators basing on principle of "Can be useful at critical moment." Generally were relatively polite.

As for Du Yibin. Then went to persuade women in Shelter to "Actively Select" disabled naturalized citizens.

Speaking of it. "Disabled Naturalized Citizens" needing to solve marriage problem were not harder than Civil Affairs Department "Finding Wives" for Volunteer Army disabled soldiers back then. Senate mass medical level very backward. Materials severely shortage. Even till now. Seriously injured wounded basically couldn't survive down. So among disabled naturalized citizens rarely had serious to "Life unable to take care of self" degree. Mostly were limb defects. Relatively speaking difficulty not too big.

Relatively difficult was Chemical Burn personnel. In Industrial Mouth disabled naturalized citizens this was a big group. Chemical Burn personnel many had facial scars and defects. Some "About same as Quasimodo." Actually to Du Yibin who contacted many disabled naturalized citizens. Legendary Quasimodo compared to them could count as handsome man.

Although Senate medical level doing plastic surgery was no problem. But limited by antibiotic etc. series of technical support not in place. Facial plastic surgery conducted very few. Du Yibin felt they were the most difficult group to handle.

Regardless how everyone talked valuing "Soul Beauty" or "Person Good" or "Enterprising Heart." Concluding to end always Visual Animal. Du Yibin sighed: "Without organization arrangement won't do..."

Du Yibin arrived Huang Hua Temple—Here used to be "Pu Ji Tang" [Benevolent Relief Hall] of Guangzhou Prefecture. Now changed to "Guangdong Province Temporary Shelter." Function same as past specializing in sheltering various "Homeless" personnel.

Here already repaired and cleaned. Past dilapidated barren scene swept empty. Although repair quite hasty sloppy. But comparing to miserable status when Liu San came to inspect initially was already Sky and Earth difference.

Director. Deputy Director a group already "Awaiting" Du Yibin arrival in front of door. Behind followed dozens of old young women children. All wearing single color wool blue cloth short jacket. Hands faces washed clean clean coming to "Welcome Chief Inspect."

Once he got off sedan. Director welcomed up. Face full of stacking smile said: "Chief Du Good! I am Director here. Called Lu Weijia. You call me Little Lu is fine."

Du Yibin seeing this "Little Lu" full face beard. Wrinkles deep. Where is "Little". Then joked: "I see calling you 'Old Lu' is about right."

"Yes. Yes. Old Lu also fine." Lu Weijia nodded repeatedly.

Du Yibin seeing him wearing a washed white old military uniform with collar badge cap emblem removed. Roughly knew this was a veteran—Not many veterans under Senate rule all liked wearing so. To show self "Background" different. Then asked intentionally: "You are soldier of which year?"

"Report Chief! I Enlisted in Zhejiang in 1632—Just National Army. Later injured when executing Public Security Subjugation in Kaohsiung. Legs feet not flexible. Then retired..."

"Originally actally a war wound soldier. Rated what grade?"

"Grade Eight. Walking not quite agile now."

"Have wife?"

Lu Weijia stunned. Hurried said: "Have... Married wife before enlisting. Staying in Lingao with children..."

Du Yibin didn't care this. Hearing he had wife then put aside. Seeing beside still a bending waist hunched back "Cadre." A face of fawning smiling towards self. Feeling somewhat annoying. Asked:

"This is..."

"This is Deputy Director Mao. Originally retained personnel here."

Mao Xiuyu waiting beside for half day hurried leaning up said: "Small One Mao Xiuyu. Is Deputy Director here. Today Chief drives arrival inspecting..."

"Alright. Alright. Don't be polite." Du Yibin impatient said. "We go inside talking."

"Yes. Yes. Please."

News of Du Yibin coming to "Inspect" notified Shelter one day ahead. Director Lu mobilized personnel yesterday doing cleaning to up and down of whole Shelter overnight. Even a leaf not seen on various roads.

However Du Yibin mind coming here wasn't inspecting. So to these meticulous preparations not caring a bit. Then asked current personnel situation in Shelter.

Lu Weijia said because condition of Huang Hua Temple relatively poor. Far inferior to "Compassion Hall" Senate self-operated so facility complete. So personnel sheltered here mostly belonged to "Special Shelter." Currently mainly sheltering disabled, elderly, orphans and part of special crowd. Prostitutes rescued in Rectifying Wind Transformation Action also uniformly sheltered here. But they had a department managing separately: "Ji Liang Suo" [Reformatory].

"What about those widows?"

"Also here. Just settled in original Pure Chaste Hall side. Because people coming many. Also increased a courtyard."

After being collected dispersed from various places Pure Chaste Halls. "Chaste Women" in yard according to "Coming Going Free" principle. Operating road fee or sending people escorting home for those able to return mom home or seeking other relatives friends; Also allowed self selecting spouse marrying.

Some having lover before marriage. Asking people to speak "Claiming Person." So as to "Continue Former Fate." "First Love" called to "Claim Person." Some ecstatic. Coming then grateful to Senate with tears and mucus; Some already married. Unwilling to come. Making woman empty joy once; Also had coming claiming willing to lead home "Taking as Concubine." In chaos also had lawless bad people. Taking opportunity abducting women. So this matter was called stop.
