# Chapter 101 - Trade Agreement

The headman led the team to an open space outside the village and instructed them to rest there. This Li village was completely different from the Li folk villages in Hainan that everyone visited in later generations. First of all, it had no stockade walls. From the outside, it looked like just a slightly larger ordinary village, surrounded by dense, thorny low trees, which were full of various vines and bamboo. Not to mention people, even rabbits could not drill through. This was the first time everyone saw such a wall.

Secondly, the boat-shaped houses iconic to the Li people, which everyone learned about from the folk villages, were nowhere to be found here. Those houses had people living above and livestock raised below, making them look very "ethnic" at first glance. However, the village before them had pyramid-shaped straw huts. The walls of the houses were made of woven bamboo strips plastered with mud, which looked very distinctive. This Nan'an Village was where the "capital" of this Dong (a type of administrative division for Li people) was located.

The so-called Li Dongs in Hainan were generally divided by natural terrain and usually consisted of several villages. The Dong Lord was recognized by the government, held a hereditary position, and was issued seals and bronze tokens as credentials. The Li native officials, such as Dong Lords and Tushe (local officials), had two main duties: first, to suppress the Li people and maintain local security and social order; second, to complete various levies assigned by the government on time every year. This included official taxes as well as "auspicious money" for the officials privately. Of course, their own income was indispensable—regardless of rank, the native officials received no salary from the government and had to rely on their own collection. In other words, as long as they paid the various official and private "dues" on time every year, the native officials could do whatever they wanted in their own territory, basically acting as local emperors.

The people remaining outside the village were uniformly managed by Zhang Berlin. Everyone was relaxed on the outside but tense on the inside, seizing the time to rest. Lu Rong, Wen Desi, and Mu Min were led by the headman into the stockade to meet the Dong Lord.

There were many curious Li people both inside and outside the village, pointing and watching from the roadside a bit further away. Wen Desi saw several old women sitting on stones by the roadside weaving rattan ware. Their faces were densely tattooed with black patterns, but when they opened their mouths, it was a pitch-black mass, which was truly terrifying. He thought this must be the "old ladies look like monsters" from the Eighteen Oddities of Hainan. Indeed, seeing is believing. (Note: The custom of facial tattooing among Li women did not completely disappear until the 1950s. Facial tattooing was firstly to prevent being abducted by outsiders, and secondly to represent loyalty in relationships. As for the color of the lips and teeth, it was purely the result of chewing betel nut every day). With a little attention, one could realize that almost all women had facial tattoos, except for young children who had not yet developed. This completely shattered everyone's fantasy about minority women.

"This custom must be revolutionized," Wei Aiwen muttered. In his original plan, recruiting Li soldiers was only the first step. Next, he wanted to take control of the team by serving as the commander of the Li soldiers—the most important link being marrying the daughter of a Li leader—the Li girl in his impression was imagined according to the image in movies. However, the scene before him seriously shook his plan.

If a headman really betrothed his daughter to him, should he accept it? It was really a headache. Moreover, women here got facial tattoos as soon as they reached adulthood... He thus worried needlessly about a pipe dream.

At this moment, let alone a headman, even ordinary Li girls didn't fancy him. To the common Li people, this was a group of terrifying figures: they heard that the "powder guns" (Note: Li people's term for muskets) in these people's hands were powerful, capable of continuous firing, and killing people from a great distance. Those who escaped back said they only heard continuous gunshots, and people died in large numbers.

Lu Rong and his group were taken to a large house in the center of the village. This house was taller and larger than ordinary dwellings, built on a base platform. Inside the house, except for the corridor in the middle, there were bamboo woven beds on three sides for everyone to sit and lie on. The fire pit was on the back wall, with a bamboo raft hanging above it for smoking food. There were windows on the side of the roof, but the lighting was still very poor. Upon entering, one felt darkness before their eyes, taking a while to adapt.

The Dong Lord was an old man with graying hair and a not-so-good complexion—they later learned that the Dong Lord was only in his early fifties, but by 17th-century standards, he counted as an elder anywhere. Lu Rong presented the specially prepared gifts: a bottle of Red Star Erguotou, a pack of rock sugar, and two folding knives.

Among these three items, the Erguotou in the glass bottle attracted his attention the most—white liquor was already popular in the Ming Dynasty, but liquor packaged in a pure, colorless flat glass bottle had a strong visual impact on anyone in this time and space. Obviously, the glass bottle, which was merely packaging in modern times, was worth much more in his eyes than the liquor.

As for the two folding knives, the Dong Lord played with them for a while and carved a few times on a wooden board, showing a look of envy in his eyes.

"Such good knives cannot be bought even in the county town." The Dong Lord looked up at them, very surprised, "Where are you from, Qiongshan?"

Wen Desi started blowing his trumpet about Australian maritime merchants again. Because he had said it many times, he was particularly practiced. The Dong Lord knew little about the outside world; as for the Han area, he had only been to Lingao County Town. The "big official"—the Prefect—in Qiongzhou Prefecture was the biggest official in his eyes. However, hearing that they were not Ming people but Han people from overseas, he was obviously much more relaxed and ordered people to bring wine to treat the guests—rice wine brewed from Shanlan glutinous rice grown by the Li people. This wine later developed into a local famous product called "Shanlan Nectar" in later generations.

Shanlan wine is the simplest glutinous rice fermented wine, with a brewing period of only seven days and minimal alcohol content, similar to the fermented glutinous rice wine of later generations. The three of them each drank a bowl.

With wine as a lubricant, talking about business became much easier, and they took the opportunity to ask about many local situations. The Dong Lord was surnamed Zhu, but this Zhu had nothing to do with Zhu Yuanzhang (founder of the Ming Dynasty). His family was the so-called "Children of Banana," hereditary headmen of this village. During the Ma Shi Uprising in the Wanli era, many Li Dongs in Lingao were involved. Only his family did not get involved. After the matter subsided, nearby villages were merged into one Dong, and he was appointed Dong Lord. The entire Dong consisted of seven villages with more than two thousand men, women, old, and young, making it a very large Dong in Lingao.

Mu Min asked how many Li people were in Lingao. This Dong Lord Zhu himself couldn't explain clearly. besides his own Dong, there were more than ten cooked Li (assimilated Li people) Dongs in Lingao, some registered in the maps, some not. The population ranged from a few hundred to one or two thousand. Past Fanbao Mountain further south was the place of the raw Li (unassimilated Li people). Besides them, there were nearby Li Dongs called Jiamao Li. In short, the internal situation of the Li people was also quite complicated. Because of different languages and living customs, they didn't interact much and rarely intermarried.

As for the government, Dong Lord Zhu said the last two county magistrates were easy to talk to and didn't demand much. As long as the fixed regular money was sent every year, they wouldn't come to nag. It was just that the roads had not been very peaceful in recent years, and Han peddlers coming to the Li area had decreased a lot. Salt was originally expensive, and now the price was even higher. If the maritime merchants could transport salt here, they would take as much as available. They were willing to exchange animal skins, red and white rattan, betel nuts, and cattle. Then the headman Fu, who had been bribed by them, proposed that it would be best to sell some iron tools, as farm tools and knives were very scarce here.

These conditions were expected, and Lu Rong agreed to all of them. Salt and iron, these two items could not be manufactured yet, but production would start very soon, and supply would not be a problem. In comparison, the Li area could provide quite a lot of useful things: timber, cotton cloth, animal skins, rattan, and pigs and cattle, all of which were urgently needed by them.

Regarding the price, Wen Desi decided not to adopt the method of high-price exploitation—doing business like those peddlers carrying loads on shoulders could indeed obtain huge profits, but the result would be selling very few things. Of course, given the low productivity and transport capacity in ancient times, plus the risks on the road, the high-price profiteering method was justifiable. But it was inappropriate for the transmigrators who mastered large-scale industrial production capabilities. If the price of salt was too high, the profit would be large, but the people would suppress their salt consumption to the minimum survival level, resulting in not selling much salt. Once the price was low, the people's consumption of salt would immediately rise.

The salt price he quoted made both Dong Lord Zhu and the headman very satisfied; it was only one-third of the peddlers' price. But even at this price, Wen Desi felt like a profiteer. Salt measurement temporarily used the official dou as the unit of weight—Wen Desi decided to make a batch of weighing instruments immediately after returning and promote the transmigrators' units of weight through trade as soon as possible. As for the price of iron tools, he was not yet clear about the market price of pig iron in the Ming Dynasty, so he only promised that it would certainly be lower than the peddlers'.

After some bargaining between the two sides, they finally reached the first trade agreement with Nan'an Dong since coming to this time and space. History calls it the "Nan'an Village Trade Agreement." The agreement stipulated: The transmigrators could sell any goods to Nan'an Dong, but each trade must carry a certain amount of salt and iron tools. Nan'an Dong would exchange any items needed by the transmigrators, but excluding population.

The 80 kilograms of salt brought this time were exchanged for more than seventy cowhides, deerskins, and boar skins, forty bolts of Qiong cloth, and one water buffalo. The things piled up in the open space made everyone feel like profiteers. They didn't know yet that peddlers specializing in Li area business could exchange one jin (old jin, equal to 594 grams) of coarse salt for a pig weighing twenty to thirty jin.

The Li people also felt they had gained benefits: there were many animal skins in every village, which were easily obtained items in their eyes; Qiong cloth was spun and used by women themselves and wasn't worth much money.

The Dong Lord additionally gave twelve bolts of Ge cloth (kudzu cloth). Ge cloth was a famous product of Hainan in the Ming Dynasty. Because it absorbed moisture and dissipated heat, it was a high-grade fabric for making summer clothes. Each family of the returned captives gave a pig as a thank-you gift for releasing the people. All parties were happy. Dong Lord Zhu sent word for the Ao Yas of each village to come and drink. At the banquet, he took out two arrows. He first asked someone to read the agreement content loudly, then chopped nine times on the arrow, and then gave the other arrow to Lu Rong.

"You chop nine times too." Mu Min told him: This was the arrow-chopping ceremony, indicating that both sides must abide by each other's regulations. If the agreement was violated, a fine of ninety cattle and ninety taels of silver would be imposed.

After chopping the arrow, they drank a few more bowls of rice wine. Both sides also designated contact persons: Lu Rong for the transmigrators, and Ao Ya Fu Dayou of this village for Nan'an Dong. Wen Desi took the opportunity to propose hoping to stay in Nan'an Dong for a few more days to see what local products they needed. If there were any, they could use these local products to offset the price of salt and iron in the future. This request was readily agreed to.
