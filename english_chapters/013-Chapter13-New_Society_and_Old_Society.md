# Chapter 13 - New Society and Old Society

Chapter 13 New Society and Old Society

After confirming the target as Lingao, the preparations of the Transmigrators entered the fast lane.

In modern times, the recruitment work presided over by Wang Luobin was in full swing. Through the screening on the Internet and the assessment of offline activities, nearly 500 people from all walks of life were finally selected.

Among these 500 people, there were engineers, doctors, soldiers, teachers, farmers, workers... covering almost all basic industries of modern society. They were dissatisfied with the reality or full of longing for the future, and signed a "Life and Death Certificate" to join this unprecedented time travel operation.

In order to train these people into a disciplined and capable team, the Executive Committee (the temporary leadership organization of the Transmigrators) organized a closed training for several months.

The training content included physical fitness, military, survival skills, ancient common sense, etc. The instructors were retired special forces soldiers and experts in various fields among the Transmigrators.

Although the training was hard, everyone's enthusiasm was high. Because they knew that they were about to go to a new world to create a new history.

At the same time, the material reserve work was also proceeding nervously.

Xiao Zishan sat in the warehouse in Guangzhou, busy receiving batches of materials transported from modern times every day.

"50 tons of steel, checked!"
"100 tons of cement, checked!"
"20 diesel generators, checked!"
"500 rifles, 100,000 rounds of ammunition... Wait, where did these come from?"

Xiao Zishan looked at the crates of arms in front of him and broke out in cold sweat. In modern China, getting so many arms was a capital crime!

"Don't worry." A young man wearing camouflage walked over. His name was Xi Yazhou, a retired scout, now the person in charge of the military group, "These are 'models' and 'air guns' purchased through special channels overseas. Although the power is a bit smaller, it is enough to deal with the Ming army and pirates."

"Overseas?" Xiao Zishan was confused.

"Hehe, don't ask about the specifics." Xi Yazhou smiled mysteriously, "In short, we have guns now. With guns, we have confidence."

Besides arms, they also prepared a large number of seeds, medicines, books, machine tools... and even a small library and a small hospital.

Wen Desi said: "We are not going to be bandits, but to build a civilization. So, knowledge and technology are our most powerful weapons."

In the Ming Dynasty, Master Gao was also busy.

According to Wen Desi's instructions, he purchased a large amount of grain, cloth and building materials in Guangzhou and transported them to the secret warehouse in Lingao by ship.

Although Master Gao didn't know what these "Australians" wanted to do, looking at the white silver, he did it diligently.

"Master Gao, you have worked hard." Wen Desi patted Master Gao on the shoulder, "When our big army arrives, your benefits will be indispensable."

"Big army?" Master Gao's heart skipped a beat, "You... are you going to send troops?"

"No, no." Wen Desi smiled, "It's an immigration group. Our countrymen admire the scenery of the Great Ming and want to come and settle down."

Master Gao breathed a sigh of relief, but suspicion in his heart grew heavier. Hundreds of people immigrating? This battle was too big.

However, he was already on the pirate ship and couldn't get off even if he wanted to. He could only bite the bullet and follow them to the dark.

Time passed day by day, and finally came the day of departure.

On this day, the weather was fine and the sea was calm.

In the training base in modern times, 500 Transmigrators were fully armed and lined up neatly. Everyone carried a huge backpack and held weapons in their hands (although they were air guns and machetes). Their faces were filled with excitement and tension.

"Comrades!" Wen Desi stood on the high platform and delivered a mobilization speech, "Today, we will bid farewell to the old world and step into the new world! We will face unknown challenges and dangers, but we also possess infinite opportunities and hope! Are you ready?"

"Ready!" Five hundred people shouted in unison, their voices shaking the sky.

"Good! Start crossing!"

With Wen Desi's order, the huge wormhole opened slowly.

Groups of Transmigrators passed through the wormhole and stepped onto the land of the Ming Dynasty.

Because the throughput of the wormhole was limited, the crossing lasted for a whole day. When the last person passed through the wormhole, the sky was already dark.

They appeared in the warehouse of Master Gao's other residence in Lingao.

It was already overcrowded. Materials were piled up like mountains, and people were crowded.

"Quick! Transfer immediately!" Wen Desi ordered, "Move to Bopu Harbor according to the original plan!"

Under the cover of night, this mighty team began to march towards Bopu Harbor.

Fortunately, Lingao's defense was really lax as expected. They didn't encounter any interception along the way. Even the barking of dogs in the villages was suppressed by their murderous aura.

At dawn, they finally arrived at the beach of Bopu Harbor.

Looking at the sparkling sea and the rising sun in the east, the Transmigrators cheered.

"We have arrived!"
"New world, here we come!"

However, reality gave them a blow right away.

The beach was desolate, with nothing. No houses, no roads, no fresh water... only endless sand and mosquitoes.

"Don't be stunned!" The voice of Wu Nanhai, the leader of the agricultural group, sounded, "Start working! Build camps! Dig wells! Cook!"

"Military group, set up guard!"
"Engineering group, level the ground!"
"General affairs group, distribute materials!"

Under the command of the Executive Committee, the Transmigrators quickly took action.

Although they were tired, no one complained. Because they knew that everything they did now was for their own future.

In the distance, several local fishermen who got up early to fish were stunned by the scene before them.

They saw hundreds of strange people with short hair and strange clothes bustling on the beach. Strange iron guys (machines) roared, tents rose from the ground...

"My mother!" A fisherman murmured, "Is this... monsters entering the village?"

"Run!" Another fisherman shouted, turned and ran.

The arrival of the Transmigrators broke the tranquility of Lingao for thousands of years. A collision between the new society and the old society began.
