# Chapter 81: Aftermath (Part 1)

Wang Luobin's heart was still pounding when he walked out of the administrative zone. To steady himself, he kept gripping his rifle. Today was close! Exhausted from construction-site work, and the enemy had come so fast!

During battle, he'd emptied one magazine—but had no idea what he'd hit. Those 30 rounds were gone in an instant. Seeing the enemy about to climb the berm, no time to reload—he'd shamefully fled. The whole experience was like a morning dream: confused, fragmented. When he came to his senses, the enemy had already retreated, and he'd somehow crossed from one side of the line to the other. Just minor scrapes... Would he survive in this world?...

Brass casings littered the ground everywhere, some still smoking—*wasteful.* The transmigrators couldn't manufacture casings yet; someone should organize collection immediately.

Lost in thought, he saw Xiao Zishan standing on the berm, looking at the bodies everywhere with a disgusted expression.

"Zishan, why are you here?" he asked.

"Arranging aftermath, you know." Xiao Zishan tried to force a calm smile but showed a nauseated expression. "Honestly, I hate seeing corpses most..."

"Nobody likes it." Wang Luobin also avoided looking at the bizarrely-positioned corpses. Clearly, even bullet-killed people didn't look like in movies—just a neat hole with a token blood pool. Instead, bullets mercilessly exposed piles of flesh and blood, soaking the ground purple-black. Without seeing it firsthand, you couldn't imagine how much blood a person had...

A nearby corpse lay twisted, missing half its skull, exposing something white and red. The cotton armor was riddled by several bullets; blood-soaked, shredded cotton batting trembled in the wind. Wang Luobin quickly looked away. A corpse-collection team hastily organized from prisoners used hook-poles—meant for pulling down barbed wire—to drag bodies, tossing them onto handcarts, wheeling them off for burial.

Watching these prisoners, faces blank, carrying and dragging corpses—the transmigrators watched grimly. "Revolution is not a dinner party, not essay-writing"—a lyric they'd once joked about. Here and now, they fully understood its dark meaning. Revolution meant blood and sacrifice. Revolution, however righteous and popular, ultimately killed mostly ordinary common people.

"By the way, Engineer Wang—tonight at 7, Committee expanded meeting."

"Expanded meeting?"

"Yes, post-battle review. Besides Committee members, also professional group leaders and key personnel. Oh, and mass representatives."

"Mass representatives?"

"Mm." Xiao Zishan's face was cold. "Tonight there'll probably be our first factional struggle."

"What? We fought pretty well." To Wang Luobin, though the battle was somewhat chaotic, results were excellent—and their own losses minimal.

"Look at it from both sides." Xiao Zishan glanced around, lowered his voice. "With such huge technological advantage—weapons centuries ahead—yet Ming soldiers penetrated our base to attack. Isn't that a failure?"

"Indeed..."

"The enemy stronghold is only four kilometers away. The Committee ignored this close-range threat, sending only three people to monitor. Isn't that underestimating the enemy?"

"Mm, mm." Wang Luobin nodded repeatedly.

"When we detected the enemy leaving the city, we didn't organize forces to harass or attack—just sat waiting for them to besiege us. What behavior is that?"

Wang Luobin broke out in cold sweat: "Zishan, this is trumped-up charges."

Xiao Zishan shook his head: "Since landing, we've followed a steady construction approach, trying hard to avoid direct conflict with Ming natives. But now it seems the aggressive line is about to take power."

"Impossible—the Committee fundamentally agrees."

"Leadership harmony is normal. That's why we're having an expanded meeting." Xiao Zishan's face was grim. "Group leaders, technical staff, mass representatives—do you know how they think?"

Wang Luobin thought, then said: "Whatever anyone says, I'll maintain the steady approach. I firmly support Director Wen's thinking." He suddenly laughed, patting Xiao Zishan's shoulder. "You're too conspiracy-minded—seeing political struggle in everything..."

While Xiao Zishan and Wang Luobin whispered, the medical team was frantically busy in the tent. Screams rose and fell. To conserve anesthetics, most wounded were fully conscious during wound-cleaning and foreign-object extraction. Some needed only medication; others required suturing.

Most wounds were minor. But many were facial—looking terrifying with blood everywhere. Many were unconscious when brought in, alarming the doctors—but examination showed it was from fear and stress, not blood loss. Doctors cleaned wounds with self-mixed saline, disinfected with alcohol, removed foreign objects, sutured.

Bacteria in this timespace had no drug resistance, so only sulfanilamide ointment was used for infection prevention. Some also needed tetanus shots.

"Done—all your iron pellets are out." Dr. Lan reassured a pitiful fellow. He'd spent over an hour extracting 20 small fragments from the man's face—some looked like shattered coins; others were unidentifiable.

"I'll be pockmarked now. Doctor, do you do cosmetic surgery?" The patient kept crying from pain and fear.

Dr. Lan thought: *I know your intestines better*, but for morale said: "No problem—I worked at a beauty clinic before."

"Then I'll book an appointment. Your skills better be good—I'm planning to marry a princess. Let's say Princess Jiu..." Yang Baogui's wife Zhang Ziyi *(Note: character's own request, not the author's quirk)*, seeing him delirious, injected the prepared sedative. The would-be prince consort fell asleep.

But some were seriously wounded. One had teeth knocked out, a hole through the cheek. Fortunately, the medical team had a dentist, with denture materials and equipment. Shi Niaoren worried about major maxillofacial wounds—he wasn't skilled at reconstructive surgery. The five doctors: he specialized in infectious diseases; Lan Fangfang in internal medicine/gastroenterology; Hippo in internal medicine with some orthopedic experience; Dr. Yang—no one wanted him treating humans—he was a veterinarian.

Wounded prisoners gathered on the ground outside the infirmary. Few moaned—most were silent, bleeding quietly. Some had wrapped wounds with rags themselves. When pirates herded them here, they were terrified, but seeing wounded pirates carried in on stretchers and emerging bandaged, they understood—these pirates would treat them. They quieted down.

As for when their turn would come—they weren't anxious. Chinese people, ancient and modern, were very patient.

Fu Bu'er also lay among them. While fleeing, he'd felt a hard shove, falling to the ground; his left leg lost all strength. Only when pirates prodded him with rifle-bayonets did he manage to hobble here. Having run desperately, he was exhausted, parched, nearly collapsed. He knew he mustn't fall—falling meant being left with the severely wounded by the roadside, from where no one rose again. Fortunately, he spotted a long-term laborer from his village, Lin Er, also wounded and in the group. He begged Lin to support him, making it here.

Wounded but mobile prisoners sat together. Pirates brought iron buckets full of water. This group, having marched then fled frantically, were desperately thirsty, crowding to drink. The slightly more injured were shoved down, groaning in pain. Guards drove them back, restoring order so everyone could drink.

Fu Bu'er drank, lay a while, felt better. The bleeding seemed to have stopped; his leg didn't hurt as much. He regretted being bewitched into following Huang Shoutong to fight pirates. He'd been living fine in his village: dozen-odd tenant households, three or four long-term laborers. Just because Huang Shoutong had once helped him repel bandits with militia, he felt grateful. Hearing these pirates were strange, he'd come with five or six men to "suppress bandits" and see the spectacle. He'd seen Huang Village militia's ferocity; this time, following the main force, he'd felt safe.

Never expected such defeat—so crushing—in just a few incense-sticks' time, total rout. The pirates' firearms were too deadly! He didn't see Huang Shoutong anywhere—probably dead, since he'd charged first.

Distant figures lying were a dozen severely wounded—too weak even to moan, only faintly groaning. Fu Bu'er knew they were beyond saving. Soon, pirates would either finish them off or bury them with the dead. He shuddered.

But his own life seemed safe—since they were treating wounds, they wouldn't rush to kill them.

"Master, what do you think the pirates will do with us?" His laborer Ma Peng whispered. His wound was trivial—sprained ankle while fleeing. He'd been pushing sandbag carts; when shooting started and men in front fell, he'd run immediately—never charging with the main force. If not for the unlucky sprain, he'd be home by now.
