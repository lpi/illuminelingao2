# Chapter 1805 - The Tax Bureau Director

On the financial front, the Delong Bank had established counters at each credit cooperative branch in addition to its municipal branches, ready to exchange silver and copper cash and prepared for deposits and lending. In the stone vault of the Delong Guangzhou Branch, wooden barrels and baskets had been prepared to receive miscellaneous silver and copper coins. In particular, large quantities of bank instruments had been prepared—after the new currency system was implemented, the Finance Ministry planned to fully promote interbank account settlement for institutional transactions, reducing cash usage.

Liu Xiang had instructed the police bureau and Zheng Shangjie, via the General Chamber of Industry and Commerce, to conduct secret investigations into Guangzhou's daily goods inventory, sales volumes, and price levels. The survey covered over a dozen categories including textiles, meat, seafood, salt, and tea. Simultaneously, to ensure real-time analysis of market data during the currency reform period, plans were underway to establish a regional data processing center within the Guangzhou Grand World, processing data collected daily as a basis for the Guangzhou finance team's assessment.

Finally, there was the organization of the Guangzhou Municipal Tax Bureau. After Liu Xiang's tireless appeals and entreaties, Wudaokou had finally sent him a Tax Bureau Director.

In a private suite reserved for Elders in the Grand World's "inner world," Elder Ai Zhixin surveyed himself in the mirror. Neat close-cropped hair, carefully maintained titanium-framed glasses, a Swiss watch on his wrist—paired with the finest white Dutch linen shirt and light khaki trousers—all conveying the "yuppie" air of a financial elite.

A pity there were no real leather shoes. These special-issue cloth shoes, however fine, felt a bit too bohemian. Elder Ai thought with some regret.

He examined himself once more, confirming everything was in perfect order, then turned. His life secretary, Ai Yixin, who had been waiting attentively, immediately handed him a high-quality BOSS replica briefcase.

"Thank you." He accepted it. This bag, salvaged from Lando's fishing vessel, was only an A-grade knockoff, but the craftsmanship and materials were superb, indistinguishable from the genuine article. It was a favorite of Elder Ai's—back when he worked at the State Tax Administration, he had been known as a fashionable aficionado of fine objects.

Ai Yixin gestured, asking if he was going out. This young life secretary was a beauty with an excellent figure, but unfortunately mute—fortunately, her inability to speak was acquired, not from birth as with the congenitally deaf. This saved Elder Ai the trouble of learning sign language.

Of course, had it not been for this physical defect, this A-rated female servant wouldn't have been graded merely as D upon graduation—leading certain sharp-tongued Elders to call him a "salvage collector."

Salvage collector it was; Elder Ai wasn't bothered. Though Ai Yixin couldn't speak and had been illiterate when she first arrived in Lingao, her learning ability was remarkable. By graduation, her scores in every subject ranked at the top. After several years under his guidance, combining self-study with his mentorship, she had become one of the most professionally capable naturalized cadres in the Wudaokou system. Were she not Elder Ai's female servant, he might well have promoted her to an important leadership position. As it stood, he could only settle for making her his personal secretary—not merely a "life" secretary.

Elder Ai had long been responsible for fiscal and tax work in the Wudaokou system. For quite some time, fiscal tax work there hadn't been prioritized—this was an unavoidable circumstance. Whether Lingao County or Qiongzhou Prefecture, neither was a prosperous region. Agriculture was backward, let alone industry and commerce. Thus, the Council of Elders' fiscal revenue had long depended on "war spoils" and "trade." The taxes subsequently collected were mainly land tax and fishing levies. Though the customs service had established import-export tariffs and berthing fees, many were waived or reduced to encourage trade—rendering them almost meaningless.

Only after Lingao's industry and commerce flourished did the tax department truly come to life. Only then did the naturalized cadres of the tax department first appreciate what "Council of Elders—Ten Thousand Taxes" meant. Tax collection was already lagging behind international standards even by 17th-century metrics—the Great Ming wasn't just behind Europe, it even trailed Japan in East Asia. The sheer number of tax categories and the complexity of rate calculations far exceeded anything they had imagined, delivering a solid conceptual shock.

Now Elder Ai had arrived in Guangzhou with the tax corps he had trained on Hainan—primarily in Lingao.

"Don't cook dinner tonight. I'll eat at the bureau. Pack the luggage, and tomorrow morning we'll move to the bureau dormitory." Ai Zhixin gave instructions. "The Municipal Government General Affairs Office will send a sedan chair and porters. Follow their arrangements. Don't go out alone—Guangzhou isn't exactly peaceful right now."

Ai Yixin nodded.

Ai Zhixin's destination was the National Tax Administration Guangzhou Branch—nominally the Guangzhou branch, but this branch also administered tax affairs for all of Guangdong Province. Wherever the Bopo Army could establish governance, tax work would follow. Naturally, policies differed between core zones, pacification zones, and security zones.

Speaking of authority, the powers granted to Ai Zhixin were unprecedentedly vast. Apart from customs duties, the collection of all industrial and commercial taxes, agricultural taxes, fishing levies, and more throughout Guangzhou and Guangdong fell under his purview. Monopoly operations were also under his management. On tax categories, rates, and collection methods, he had the power to "act at his discretion as long as it doesn't violate the general direction."

Naturally, such sweeping authority came at a price: completing tax work in an extremely complex environment—no light burden. Not only were matters endlessly complicated, but work had to be completed despite extreme shortages of personnel and institutions. Simultaneously, he had to coordinate with Chen Ce's finance team on the new currency issuance. Tax collection was not merely for increasing fiscal revenue but also a vital tool for currency stabilization. Through taxation, merchants could be effectively compelled to accept and use the new currency.

Under these circumstances, Ai Zhixin was carried by sedan chair to the Salt Tax Office. Two plaques now hung at its entrance: the National Tax Administration Guangzhou Branch, and the Finance Ministry Monopoly Bureau Guangzhou Branch. Salt and tobacco monopolies were also important sources of revenue for Wudaokou. Currently, no Elder was responsible for the Monopoly Bureau, so the Tax Bureau was handling its duties—broadly speaking, monopolies were also a form of taxation.

Having grown accustomed along the way to the stench of stagnant water and open gutters under the June sun, upon descending from the sedan chair he felt a sudden freshness in the air. The Salt Tax Office was an old institution, almost as old as Ming history itself. Its most recent renovation dated to the Jiajia reign. The walls were high, the buildings deep, the courtyards spacious, with numerous century-old trees forming dense, verdant canopies.

Because Guangzhou had only recently been pacified, National Army soldiers still guarded the main entrances. Ai Zhixin recalled that during his journey into the city, Japanese warrior bodyguards had escorted his sedan chair, and he understood just how complex the situation he faced truly was.

The Tax Bureau and Monopoly Bureau staff were already waiting to receive him at the ceremonial gate. On either side of the pathway, the personnel had naturally divided into two groups. On the left were the naturalized personnel led by Hu Xuefan—some transferred from Hainan, some former workers from the City Engineering Department's Wansheng Rental Warehouse. These formed the core of Ai Zhixin's tax bureau team. On the right were the old staff retained after surrender and screening: household department secretaries, clerks, tax collectors, River-and-Lake Patrol Office superintendents, salt warehouse managers, and clerical assistants of every grade... a complete spectrum, from unranked officials down to the lowest-class "runners."

As the senior-ranking naturalized cadre in the Tax Bureau, Hu Xuefan welcomed the new director. Then, led by a veteran clerk from the Salt Tax Office, they proceeded to the office.

As he followed the old clerk through those imposing buildings, he realized how dilapidated they had become. The long-neglected walls were mottled and stained, covered with moss and mold. Roofs bristled with wild grasses, some even sprouting small trees. The old clerk explained that portions of the complex had been locked and abandoned for years due to disrepair. Some old salt warehouses had already collapsed.

This place is certainly gloomy enough, Ai Zhixin thought.

The courtyard that would serve as both office and quarters had been tidied up thoroughly, furnished with all necessary items and daily supplies. Ai Zhixin instructed the accompanying clerks to open his document cases and organize the files onto shelves. He himself quickly reread the situation reports on fiscal and tax work that the City Engineering Department had sent.

Guangzhou's fiscal situation was rather complex—not only because the Ming dynasty's fiscal system was inherently chaotic, but because the Council of Elders itself had spent years collecting "Reasonable Burden" and "Fishing Levies" in Guangzhou and the Pearl River Delta region, while also selling contraband salt in large quantities in Guangzhou.

Ai Zhixin had previously studied Ming fiscal policy in Lingao, but Qiongzhou Prefecture had been too poor and backward, with pitifully few actual tax practices for the local authorities to implement. Now, reviewing Guangzhou Prefecture's tax records, he found himself genuinely enlightened.

The Great Ming didn't emphasize industrial and commercial taxes much. Apart from land tax and salt duties, other revenues were lumped together as "miscellaneous." The collection of these miscellaneous items was both confused and complex. Though official "departmental precedents" existed on paper, actual implementation varied from place to place.

The most important of these for local governments was the commercial tax, similar in nature to the Qing dynasty's "likin" transit tax. The difference was that commercial tax had fixed quotas. Each prefecture and county had specific commercial tax quotas—some absurdly high, others laughably low. As for how these quotas had originally been determined, no one any longer knew.

Authorities dispatched clerks to collect taxes at roadside and ferry checkpoints. The rates were low, but the scope was vast. Anything could be taxed—even a single chicken or basket of vegetables. A repeated-taxation principle applied: a farmer carrying vegetables to market would pay taxes at every checkpoint along the way.

The clerks and runners sent to collect these taxes not only received no income but were also required to meet set revenue quotas. Thus the commercial tax checkpoints became a form of de facto tax farming. Corruption and extortion were inevitable consequences. The result: widespread popular resentment, while actual revenue remained negligible as taxes leaked away layer by layer into private pockets.
