# Chapter 2341 - The Hearing (V)

Ma Jia stood up and announced: "Next, is a hearing on whether there was dereliction of duty by the Political Security Bureau in this Wuzhou Incident." He turned around and signaled, "Comrade Zhao Manxiong, please."

Zhao Manxiong had been sitting upright in the venue for a long time. He still had the same image as in the past, wearing a somewhat faded black cotton uniform jacket, wearing a harmless smile. Moreover Ma Jia discovered: despite his great fame and prominent body type, he had a special invisibility ability that made people unable to notice him in public occasions.

Zhao Manxiong took a notebook, came to the hearing seat and sat down. After routine oath-taking and identity declaration, inquiry into the Political Security Bureau began.

Ever since its establishment, the Political Security Bureau had always been a thorn in many Senators' hearts. Although the charge of "monitoring Senators" had never been verified, to many people, the slogan "Ubiquitous" on propaganda posters was like the Sword of Damocles. Spies planted by the Political Security Bureau in various industries and departments, although theoretically not monitoring Senators, undoubtedly, it wasn't hard to mention Senator behavior "in passing" in reports.

Therefore there was always a voice inside the Senate wanting to abolish the Pol-Sec Bureau. But the utility of the Pol-Sec Bureau was obvious, especially for departments heavily dependent on the Pol-Sec system for intelligence and security work. Plus the upper layer of the Senate mostly held an approving attitude toward the Pol-Sec Bureau, and Zhao Manxiong deliberately maintained a low-profile style—Pol-Sec Bureau personnel rarely showed faces in public occasions, and rarely conducted fanfare public arrests. So this voice never came true.

But to those Senators most hostile to the Pol-Sec Bureau, "This department must die" had become their creed. For this they spared no effort to find allies everywhere, seizing every major accident to find fault. Greatly having the meaning of not finishing until the Pol-Sec Bureau was killed.

The Wuzhou Incident obviously gave them another good opportunity. A group of people rubbed fists and wiped palms, ready to drag out Zhao Manxiong, this "Conspirator in the Corner", "Grey Eminence in Bairen City" in one go to criticize and stink him, thereby completely getting rid of the Pol-Sec Bureau this black den.

Sure enough, as soon as Zhao Manxiong took his seat, someone requested to speak.

Zhao Manxiong coughed lightly, turned to Ma Jia, and said: "Comrade Chairman, before comrades' inquiry begins, I have a small request, hope you can approve."

"Please speak."

"I think, today's inquiry topics probably will be very many—can see there are quite a few comrades wanting to speak. To save everyone's time. I want to ask inquiring comrades to speak one by one first, forming an inquiry outline, then I answer one by one according to the outline. This can avoid repetitive speeches and answers. If everyone is not satisfied with my answer or has supplements, after I answer one round everyone can continue asking."

Ma Jia nodded. He was actually quite worried about this old colleague. Because the current situation was unkind to the Pol-Sec system, and Zhao Manxiong indeed found it hard to defend himself.

He turned his gaze to attendees: "Does everyone have any opinion?"

Although someone proposed this was "Zhao Manxiong's trick", most Senators believed this request wasn't excessive—they also couldn't bear chaotic shouting-style questioning.

Inquiry subsequently began. Starting from the first questioner, Zhao Manxiong didn't open the notebook in his hand, just listening carefully, nodding slightly from time to time. Besides this, you could hardly see what exactly he was thinking. His face consistently maintained an indescribable smile.

There were many inquirers, but summarized main aspects concentrated on two points; One, Wuzhou as a key frontline city, with a Senator stationed, why was there only one political security personnel transferred from the Foreign Intelligence Bureau, without any other manpower and material reinforcement. Luo Yangming who had zero political security experience could only carry out work under extremely little support; Two, severe leaks appeared in political vetting of Jiang Yougong, Liu Youwang and others. Did Pol-Sec controlling the political review link all along still have any meaning?

Ma Jia saw no one spoke anymore, asked: "Does anyone else have questions?"

He asked three times in a row, confirming no one wanted to speak again, then nodded signaling Zhao Manxiong could start.

Zhao Manxiong nodded, opened the notebook unhurriedly, and said in his consistently gentle tone:

"Comrades, I summarized just now, totally some people raised fifteen queries to the Pol-Sec Bureau, requiring me to answer. Specifically..."

He repeated everyone's inquiry one by one, then said "...Don't know if I missed any. But roughly just these. Everyone shouldn't have opinions right?"

Seeing everyone had no objection, Zhao Manxiong continued:

"...Actually these fifteen queries, I summarized, are mainly two aspects: One is our force projection problem in Wuzhou—obviously seriously insufficient. This is a fact, I have nothing to defend. Two is omissions in political security work responsible by our Bureau. I summarize like this, presumably everyone has no opinion either right? Oh right, there is also one about Senator security work, Comrade Pan has already said this before, this isn't a matter within our authority range, so I won't answer either."

"Just speak quickly! Bullshitting so much!" Someone cursed directly below.

"I state my stance first, which is also our Political Security Bureau's stance. Regarding the two main problems everyone raised, we have nothing to defend. Indeed, our input to Wuzhou was zero, and political review work was done very poorly, appearing big leaks. These are all facts. Comrades criticized very correctly. This is also the direction of our improvement in the future..."

"Just afraid no need for you to improve..." Someone interjected sarcastically. Ma Jia knocked the gavel with a serious face, shouting: "Silence! If have questions please speak separately in the second inquiry round!"

"...Although responsibility lies with us, I also want to remind everyone to grasp some basic background materials first..." Saying that he turned to Ma Jia, "Please allow me to distribute some basic materials in the form of slides."

"Allowed."

The venue dimmed down. Everyone didn't know what medicine this secret police head sold in his gourd, whispering one by one. Faces showed curious expressions. Ma Jia actually had no bottom in his heart. Originally thought Zhao Manxiong prepared to use the "Stand at attention to receive beating" routine to muddle through, but seeing him distributing materials with confidence knew there were tricks inside.

Materials on slides passed one by one. Turned out these materials were all various reports and applications for budget, adding institutions, increasing personnel proposed by the Political Security Bureau—of course, all rejected without exception.

"...Before launching the Liangguang Campaign, my Bureau submitted a plan for Liangguang Pol-Sec work to the Senate, including specific plans for setting up branch institutions in various counties and related personnel, budget drafts. However these plans were all rejected after entering the review stage. Only passed the budget for setting up branch institution in Guangzhou and the memorandum on personnel transfer between my Bureau and Foreign Intelligence Bureau. So strictly speaking, except for Guangzhou Special City, other cities in Liangguang region don't have formal Pol-Sec branch institutions." Zhao Manxiong said unhurriedly, "Later, after occupying Guangzhou we proposed a second modified budget plan, drastically reducing the scale and establishment of various branch institutions. It also encountered rejection in relevant budget supplementary review. So currently my Bureau's branch institutions and personnel in various places are all transferred from Foreign Intelligence Bureau personnel. Because there is no relevant budget, temporarily they are 'dispatched' and established in the form of long-term business trips—of course, thanks to extra subsidies given to my Bureau by Guangdong local leaders and finance-tax departments. Enabling us to maintain the operation of Pol-Sec system minimumly..."

The venue instantly went into an uproar. Among attendees some participated in auditing, some didn't. But a few people among them were especially clear in heart. Because the action of "Sniping Pol-Sec Expanding Power" at that time was exactly hosted and connected by them, and after successfully rejecting relevant proposals they even held a banquet to celebrate. At this moment they remembered how they ridiculed Zhao Manxiong and others as "Cosplay Masters", "Soviet Fans without political brains" at the celebration banquet.

Ma Jia was also startled. He knew about this matter. At that time budget plans were sniped twice; he once discussed with Zhao Manxiong how to handle follow-up problems. One was continuing to do work, striving to pass in budget supplementary review. But this needed time; at that time a plan was proposed to take the administrative route, issuing documents by Guangzhou Branch Bureau to "dispatch", funds of local branch institutions subsidized by local governments. Of course, actually local governments everywhere faced chaotic situations, fundamentally unable to subsidize and coordinate, so local branches were basically "one-man institutions" similar to Luo Yangming transferred from local intelligence agents.

But this wasn't a long-term plan, because theoretically Pol-Sec was "Vertical Leadership", funds belonging to central budget. Doing so was equivalent to "Localization". So Ma Jia's suggestion was to start doing work as soon as possible, striving to pass in the review of budget supplementary bill.

However, this Deputy Director Zhao's attitude at that time was very ambiguous. He not only didn't show disappointment or resentment, instead expressed he "completely understood Senators' emotions, would slowly conduct persuasion work".

*Could it be he realized long ago that Guangdong would have similar situations, so prepared a retreat right at this time?* Ma Jia's heart tightened—*Very likely!*

He associated that after the Trouble in Lingao incident Zhao Manxiong frequently submitted various reports, increasing budget, increasing personnel, adding institutions, various plans and schemes regarding organization and work. Every time the Senate met to review relevant matters, almost always Pol-Sec Bureau's various applications would appear, but without suspense, most were either shot down or "partially passed". Actually in these years, Pol-Sec Bureau didn't have too big development. Whether personnel or funds, all maintained a very low level.
