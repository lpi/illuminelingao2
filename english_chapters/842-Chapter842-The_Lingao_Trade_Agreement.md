# Chapter 842: The Lingao Trade Agreement

The first business negotiations with the Dutch ended "in a warm and friendly atmosphere." Skaed secretly found it amusing—many things the Dutch had argued strenuously for were actually completely trivial to him, but he had obtained many concessions in exchange. The Dutch's most resolute demand for "no bulk purchasing" came from real-world lessons, so Van der Lanthroon firmly demanded that the Dutch be given the right to freely sell goods in Lingao.

Skaed "reluctantly" finally agreed to this request. In Lingao, except for the Transmigrators, there probably wouldn't be anyone who needed so many Dutch goods, nor could anyone produce such a large amount of working capital to buy the Dutch goods. The *Qionghai* of Gu Baocheng certainly had this capability, but Gu Baocheng would never do such a tactless thing. In foreign trade, no one in Lingao dared not to follow the baton of the Department of Colonization and Trade.

The two sides reached a preliminary agreement on trade:

The goods brought by the *Magdeburg*, having already paid taxes and cleared customs, would all be purchased at certain prices by the Foreign Trade Company under the Department of Colonization and Trade. The guiding prices would be the prices at which the East India Company sold to Chinese sea merchants in Tayouan. For goods not sold at Tayouan Port, the two sides would negotiate.

From this trade onward, both sides would conduct bilateral trade under a new trade agreement. The conditions were as follows:

The Dutch East India Company had the right to freely sell goods at the two ports of Lingao and Sanya under the Senate's control. Anyone could purchase goods from the East India Company. The Australians would not levy any fees on the East India Company's imports except for the customs duties approved by both sides.

The Dutch East India Company could dispatch unlimited batches and unlimited numbers of trade ships each year to the trading ports designated open by the Senate. The specific trading ports would be revised once a year. Currently, the Senate specially permitted the opening of Lingao and Sanya for trade. If necessary, the Senate could increase or decrease open ports at any time, but at least one trading port must be reserved for the Company.

Dutch East Indies ships entering these ports must fly designated signal flags. After entering the port, they must fully obey the commands of port personnel and pay all port fees—these fees could not be reduced or waived. Otherwise, the port authority had the right to confiscate equivalent imported goods as compensation.

After Company ships entered port, all weapons must be sealed, and they must accept all quarantine and disinfection measures. Those refusing to accept would be immediately expelled from the port.

Half of the tonnage carried to Qiongzhou must be for goods specified by the Department of Colonization and Trade; a specific catalog for such goods would be provided. If insufficient specified goods were brought on this voyage, they must be made up on the next voyage. Otherwise, related trade would be suspended.

The Company could rent trading houses built by the Department of Colonization and Trade at designated open ports. Merchants and sailors must live together in the trading houses or on ships. No outside lodging was permitted. The rent for the trading house was 500 guilders per year. Food and daily necessities would be purchased by Company personnel themselves from the market, with the Department of Colonization and Trade providing convenience.

The last item was judicial jurisdiction. Van der Lanthroon agreed to Lingao's judicial jurisdiction but requested judicial privileges in commercial disputes. The so-called special rights were not extraterritoriality or such but rather a request that once commercial disputes arose between the Company and local merchants, the Department of Colonization and Trade must give certain preferential treatment, mainly regarding debt collection and bankruptcy liquidation. He requested that Skaed guarantee the Company priority rights in the event of such incidents. At the same time, the Company would be allowed to station a consul in Lingao to protect the Company's commercial interests.

Skaed indicated that execution wasn't a problem. As long as the East India Company recognized the Australians' judicial jurisdiction over commercial activities occurring in Qiongzhou, once the Lingao Maritime-Commercial Court made a judgment, it would definitely be executed in full.

The Dutch East India Company permitted Australian ships to sail in the East Indies and Taiwan waters under equivalent conditions. Australian ships had the right to enter Batavia and Tayouan for trade at any time. Australians could also establish trading houses there and station consular personnel. At the same time, they guaranteed that Australian ships could enter Banten safely and without harassment at any time. Whatever privileges Lingao gave to the Dutch East India Company, the Dutch East India Company would simultaneously grant to Lingao.

Finally: Both sides agreed to station consuls in Batavia and Lingao respectively to protect their own commercial interests.

Of course, given Lingao's situation, it was impossible in the short term to have many ships going to Batavia—currently Lingao's problem was insufficient transport capacity. But through this step, it could gradually attract those Ming merchants willing to go to Batavia to come under Lingao's banner. Historically, Batavia was a Southeast Asian destination that Chinese sea merchants frequently visited for trade. And the Zheng family and Liu Xiang basically didn't directly get involved in this route. Skaed planned to first squeeze control of this route from their hands, and then collect passage protection fees. After all, the Lingao regime already had at least a basic concept of protecting overseas merchants and citizens, rather than just staying at the mountain king level of monopolizing routes to collect tolls. In other words, the Lingao regime was conscious of "taking money and providing protection," while the other sea lords were merely "taking money and not causing trouble." The difference was obvious at a glance. The reason the Lingao regime could win more hearts than the Ming regime was actually because of this.

After reaching the trade agreement, both sides then negotiated on trade commodities and customs details. Van der Lanthroon knew that the Company was most interested in dumping spices from the East Indies—this was one of the few commodities the Dutch could dump in large quantities. The Dutch had already formed a tight network for purchasing, storing, and selling crops in the East Indies. Compared to rice and timber, the most convenient thing for the Dutch to supply to China was spices. But Lingao was obviously uninterested in spices. And in the previous agreement, it had already been confirmed that half of the general cargo must carry goods from the Lingao-designated catalog—which didn't include spices. That meant he could at most use the remaining cargo capacity entirely for spices, while the 24% tariff could completely make spice trade unprofitable.

This junior merchant did his utmost to demand a significant reduction in spice tariffs, at least down to 5%, but Skaed was unmoved. Although spices could serve as a useful entrepôt trade commodity, Lingao had never sold spices on the mainland after all and might not be able to compete with existing distributors. If spice trade became profitable, the Dutch would be too lazy to transport other goods.

Finally, both sides reached a compromise: the import tariff for spice trade would be 12%, a 50% reduction. Van der Lanthroon knew it would be difficult to obtain enough profit from spices. For this, he had to consider what goods to export to Lingao. If suitable goods couldn't be found, the Company would have to consider the amount of silver quota to allocate to Lingao. In trade with the Ming, the East India Company's main export commodity was actually silver.

The silver the Company transported from Japan, Persia, and Europe disappeared as if poured into a black hole in trade with the Ming. The East India Company had always hoped to reverse this situation. From the current situation, the Australians had far more demand than the Ming who didn't seem to need anything. Just from this specified goods catalog, the East India Company could trade in many commodities. Timber and rice among the bulk goods were both materials effectively obtainable from the East Indies. Although rice didn't have great export potential in the East Indies, the Company had trade ports in Siam, where rice was very abundant. They could completely open up a Siam-Lingao rice trade route.

From the list the Australians provided, they needed large quantities of metal products. But on this point, the Dutch were powerless. In East Asia, except for copper being Japan's major export commodity, other metal product exporters were mainly the Ming. But directly importing copper from Japan was currently difficult. Dutch-Japanese trade had actually been in a state of suspension recently. It seemed necessary to request the Batavia Council to see if a channel for obtaining Japanese copper could be opened as soon as possible.

The Australians also specified that they transport various colors of high-quality woolen cloth, fine and coarse linen, and leather. Not only the locally popular deerskin but also rougher goods like cowhide and sheepskin attracted their interest. Besides woolen cloth and linen, which needed to be shipped from Europe, leather could be shipped from Basra in Persia—Persia had sufficient leather supply.

As for imports from Lingao, Van der Lanthroon had already made a decision. First was glass products. Lingao's glass products, including mirrors, came in many styles, were of good quality, and had prices cheaper than European goods shipped from thousands of miles away. They could be sold in the East Indies, throughout Southeast Asia, and Persia, serving as trade goods shipped to various places. Second was Lingao's white sugar. From the quality of Lingao white sugar the English had transported to the East Indies, this was a high-grade product they had never seen. It was not only far superior to various local sugar products in Southeast Asia but even better than Fujian and Guangdong sugar from the Ming, which had always been known for high quality. It could be sold at high prices when transported to Persia and Europe. Then there were the Ming products for re-export from Lingao.

Van der Lanthroon and Skaed hit it off immediately in the area of re-exports. Since trade with the Dutch in Tayouan—whether with Zheng Zhilong or Liu Xiang—had the problem of prices being too high, the Australians of Lingao could very well take their place. Skaed said they could "supply without limit" various silk products and raw silk, as well as all Ming commodities that the Dutch were interested in.

Van der Lanthroon found this curious because, except for the Portuguese who had the right to regularly enter Guangzhou, no merchant from any country had dared to boast so boldly. Without relying on Chinese merchants' own ships to transport goods out of port for trade, it was very difficult for Europeans to obtain sufficient Chinese goods. After all, until now, all the efforts the Dutch had made on the Chinese coast had not been able to achieve this purpose.
