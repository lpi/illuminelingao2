# Chapter 114 - Gou Family Stockade (4)

That night, the military group held a simple staff meeting based on the results of reconnaissance and interrogation. The meeting was led by Wu De. He was the person in charge of this operation. In terms of the 21st century, he should be: Gou Family Stockade Demolition Project Manager.

Wu De wanted to engage in violent demolition, so naturally, he needed people. Whether by coincidence or intention, several important leaders of the military group were not in Bairen City. The only army faction leader left in the military group leadership was He Ming. He Ming was an old soldier, known for obeying orders and having strong principles, making it relatively easy to coordinate with Wu De, who came from a navy background.

Besides personnel from the military group, representatives from professional groups of various committees also attended. Gou Family Stockade would be their first trophy. Although it was just a small bully's village stockade, it was a prelude to seizing larger county towns, prefectural cities, and even the capital in the future. Preparations had to be made for how to pacify the people, how to confiscate materials and property, and how to conduct propaganda after occupying the residential area.

Based on the mastered situation, the defense level of Gou Family Stockade was not very solid even by the standards of this time and space. Breaking it directly with force was not difficult. The military group proposed the simplest and safest plan for personnel: use rifles to clear the village braves on the stockade wall, then use protected engineering machinery to ram the gate directly. No matter how thick the wooden gate was, even if wrapped in iron sheets, it couldn't withstand a bulldozer with hundreds of horsepower. However, this plan was a bit luxurious. The terrain from Bairen City to Gou Family Stockade was flat, posing no problem for tracked vehicles, but the distance was a bit far. Besides fuel consumption, the motorcycle hours consumed by the machinery itself were also considerable.

A simpler way would be to let the assault team members use scaling ladders or simply human ladders to climb the stockade wall, occupy the gate, and then open it. But after climbing the stockade, nine out of ten they would encounter a counter-charge from village braves, maybe even hand-to-hand combat—most people in the military group were not afraid of bayonet fighting, but if casualties occurred, the loss would be somewhat irreparable.

"We can't plan for everything to be foolproof," He Ming said, "Soldiers are forged in battle, not raised like this." He lit a crumpled cigarette.

"The stockade gate is not a big problem," Ji Situi spoke on behalf of the chemical group, "Our chemical group has manufactured a batch of explosives, which can be used to blow open the stockade gate. If necessary, we can also provide hand grenades."

"Explosives?" Everyone was a bit surprised. To avoid trouble, no explosives or pyrotechnic supplies were purchased during the preparation of materials. Where did the explosives come from now?

"Is it black powder?" Someone remembered capturing about a hundred jin of black powder from village braves last time.

"Not that low-level." Ji Situi laughed proudly. Because the chemical group lacked necessary raw materials and energy in the past two months, all personnel had to focus on infrastructure projects: installing those few sets of production equipment. Now that the factory buildings and equipment installation were almost done, these maniacs with extremely strong hands-on ability immediately started the trial production of the transmigration sharp weapon—explosives.

The foundation of explosives is the chemical industry. Currently, the chemical group had complete sets of equipment and technology but lacked production raw materials, especially coal and salt. So the basic three acids and two alkalis hadn't been put into production yet. Fortunately, the chemical group had considered military needs early on. When purchasing chemical raw materials, they specially bought a batch of finished ammonium nitrate fertilizer—this was not for Wu Nanhai's use. Now using this batch of fertilizer as raw material, they produced an upgraded version—ammonium nitrate explosive.

Anyone who knows a little about explosives knows: Ammonium nitrate itself is also a low-power explosive. The chemical group certainly wasn't satisfied with using fertilizer directly as explosives—firstly, it didn't show their level; secondly, it was a waste of limited resources. The method to upgrade ammonium nitrate into ammonium nitrate explosive is to add some other ingredients. There are several formulas, some adding high explosives, some adding combustible materials. Ammonium nitrate explosives are usually used more in blasting engineering, but can also be used to fill explosive weapons like landmines and hand grenades. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army both bought ammonium nitrate from enemy-occupied areas and processed it for use as explosives. The advantage is acceptable power and low sensitivity; it won't explode whether hit by bullets, burned, or vibrated.

The finished product brought out by the chemical group was ammonium wood explosive. As the name suggests, wood flour was added to it—this stuff was everywhere in the Bopu Sawmill, effortless to get. The chemical group produced about fifty kilograms using simple equipment. They didn't dare make more because this stuff absorbs moisture easily and fails immediately after becoming damp. In Hainan, the air humidity is relatively high all year round.

(Note: Raw material ratios and manufacturing processes are not written here. With the National Day celebration approaching, let's not discuss these sensitive things.)

As for the primer for detonation, the chemical group had no mercury available and couldn't make mercury fulminate for the time being. However, black powder is also a good booster explosive. Although the quality of the black powder captured in the Battle of Bairen Beach was poor, using a little more quantity would do. To ensure the quality of its ignition, the chemical group specially reprocessed and granulated this black powder, packing it into paper rolls and sealing the outside with wood tar pitch for moisture protection.

"Let's have a heartless cannon (flying thunder cannon). Simple to make and powerful." Zhang Berlin looked excited. He felt delivering explosive packs wasn't flavorful enough; it had to be shelling Gou Family Stockade.

"Completely unnecessary." He Ming shook his head repeatedly, "The range of projecting explosive packs is insufficient, and there is no accuracy. Heaven knows where the explosive pack will be thrown."

"Yes, doing so causes too much damage. If it falls into the residential area, there will be great casualties. We are fighting Great Household Gou; ordinary people should be protected as much as possible." Wu Nanhai firmly opposed.

Zhang Berlin raised a sharp question: "Fine, then who are you planning to send to deliver the explosive pack? The enemy has bows, arrows, and firearms at long range, and logs, stones, plus lime bottles and hot feces at close range."

He Ming laughed: "With 50 SKS rifles locking down the city wall, the firepower intensity is sufficient."

"But the enemy can hide behind the battlements!"

"You don't know the power of the M43 bullet, do you?" Student Lin Shenhe, the sniper present, smiled, "This thing can definitely penetrate that layer of bricks of the battlements within 100 meters."

Continuous firing of fifty SKS-D semi-automatic rifles with 20-round magazines provided firepower comparable to machine guns. Even Mazinger Z couldn't stay there, let alone throwing logs and stones from above.

"Still not reconciled without cannons." Zhang Berlin was still unsatisfied.

The plan to break the stockade gate was thus decided. The military group would organize firepower to sweep the wall top, then deliver explosive packs to directly blow open the stockade gate, and everyone would assault into the stockade together.

"Things aren't over after breaking into the stockade," He Ming pointed at the map, "Actually, there's nothing much inside the stockade itself; it's all ordinary people's housing. We just need to occupy the intersections and send people to patrol the stockade wall to prevent anyone from escaping—this is very crucial! The key is the Gou family's residence part. Once the outer wall is lost, all their forces will shrink inside to defend to the death. So after we enter the stockade, the first step is to quickly occupy the front and back gate intersections of the Gou family residence to prevent routed soldiers from everywhere retreating into the house—the fewer of them enter, the easier it is for us to deal with them."

Wu De said, "From interrogating the captives just now, we know that there are more than two hundred village braves and family guards in the entire Gou Family Stockade. Most of them are wanted criminals from the mainland government. This group of people mostly have human life lawsuits on them. Once they retreat inside and struggle desperately, it will give us great trouble."

"Is the inner residence very solid?"

"We drew a map based on the captives' confession." Wu De pasted the map on the blackboard, "Entering from the main gate is an east-west cross street. Along the cross street, seven routes of courtyards are lined up. Some have five entries, some have three. These large and small main and side courtyards are inhabited by the Gou family's same clan. In addition, there are many side courtyards, group rooms for family guards, and warehouse courtyards. These courtyards all have their own walls. However, as long as our army enters the stockade, the Gou family, old and young, will become turtles in a jar, with no way to escape. He will probably spare no reward to make those family guards sell their lives to defend him, and those same clansmen are estimated to fight desperately too. There are several water wells in the residence, and usually, a lot of grain, firewood, and charcoal are stored. If they really want to resist to the death, we can only rely on people to storm it."

"Attacking the residence is not difficult. Rifles and explosives together, we can take it down very quickly."

"The most valuable things in Gou Family Stockade are all in the inner residence part. It will be meaningless to us if smashed." Wu De emphasized their purpose again and again, "And we also have to guard against them setting fire to the house in despair. The gold, silver, treasures, and grain inside would all be gone."

"Wonder how much treasure the Gou family has." Someone already started to look fascinated.

"Haven't you heard? The Gou family is also a pirate den. The things robbed from the sea must be plentiful. We are going to make a fortune!"

"What is most useful to us now is not treasure, but grain!" Wu Nanhai was more anxious than anyone because he knew the grain reserve situation better than anyone.

"Whether grain or treasure, it will all be ours after conquering it." Wu De laughed, "However, speed is precious in war. The scout killed the people of Second Master Gou today. Even if the Gou family were all pigs, they should know someone is going to act against them. Maybe they will transfer and hide property. I propose organizing a team to set off tomorrow to control the surroundings of the stockade first."

"Conquering the stockade, needless to say, there will be many spoils. We can't move them all out just by ourselves. Using cars, there are no good roads locally. We have to use manpower to transport them out. This depends on mobilizing the masses."

"I would have forgotten if you didn't say it." Wu De remembered, "Aren't the common people of Salt Field Village ready-made? Xi Yazhou is doing a colorful job over there. Tell the work team to mobilize all the old and young in the village. We can't count on them for fighting for the time being, but standing guard, keeping watch, and carrying things are still useful."

Everyone discussed how many people to use, how much equipment and materials for the siege to bring, how to arrange medical support, how to write notices for cultural propaganda, and how to screen and relieve the common people. They discussed until almost midnight before settling everything one by one.
