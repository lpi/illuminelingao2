# Chapter 130: The Slave Market (Part 2)

Indeed, this wasn't a free market. The moment these well-dressed visitors entered, several slave dealers swarmed, hawking their merchandise:

"Look at this one—perfectly aligned glutinous teeth that can bite through gold and jade—fifteen *liang*, how about it?"

"See this girl's hair—jet-black..."

"Mine may look older, but she's literate! Scholar-family background. The Jincui Pavilion madam offered fifty *liang*—I refused!"

"You gentlemen want servants, right? This girl's perfect—formerly served a Fujian wealthy household—already trained. Figure and face—both excellent! My rock-bottom price: twenty-five *liang*!"

...

The cacophony momentarily stunned Xiao Zishan's group. They'd never witnessed such scenes. Seven or eight dealers spitting and shoving girls toward them—tugging at hair, lifting arms to show skin. These girls—ages eleven or twelve through early twenties—were reasonably attractive but malnourished and thin, with sallow skin. Being pinched and prodded by dealers—wanting to cry but not daring—their faces showed suppressed tears and sorrow. Xiao Zishan's heart sank. Indeed tragic. Others showed pained expressions.

Two escorts quickly pushed the dealers aside. Liu Gang turned back: "Chief Manager, buying some children?"

Xiao Zishan wavered. Apparently, slightly attractive girls here were mostly bought by dealers. Each girl cost six to fifty *liang*, totaling thirty to forty. Buying all would be expensive. The ages were also young—were twelve- or thirteen-year-olds adolescents or children? While hesitating, Yan Maoda suggested: "Commissioner Xiao—let's just bulk-buy. We can bargain hard."

"Even bargained down—still several hundred *liang*." Zhang Xin shook his head. "Let's start with people the dealers aren't interested in. Once we've bought many, seeing we ignore their merchandise, they'll discount."

"Good approach. We planned on buying some children for raising and educating anyway."

"What's our budget? I need a baseline."

"Under 500 *liang*. Slightly over is fine."

The group bypassed the dealers—heading deeper in. Along the way, shelters and open ground were everywhere, packed with refugees—young and old—begging whenever people approached. Plaintive cries rose and fell endlessly.

At the next crossroads: a large crowd. Approaching, they saw a woman clutching a man's legs, wailing and pleading. On the ground amid rags: two children—the older one three or four, the younger still swaddled. The woman's family had fled here; everyone else had died—only these three, mother and children, remained. A dealer wanted the woman but not the children.

The woman—beaten bloody, nose and mouth streaming—lay on the ground. The dealer was still kicking and cursing: "Stubborn whore! I don't run a charity—why would I feed your brats!" Grabbing her hair, he was about to drag her away.

Zhang Xin was about to speak—when someone shouted: "Stop!" The crowd parted—several servants approached, escorting a young man around thirty. The crowd whispered: "Young Master Liang is here."

This person approached the dealer: "You bought her—why force her to abandon her children! These two are so young—without their mother, they'll surely die!"

The dealer recognized him—quickly defending: "Your Honor, our business isn't easy. Her sickly body, dragging two children—who'd buy her? If I agreed, I'd have two extra mouths to feed for nothing."

Young Master Liang grew angry: "If it's not profitable, don't buy—why force families apart!"

The dealer smiled bitterly: "Come now—I meant well but caused evil? At her condition, if I don't buy, her whole family starves tomorrow! At least I'm saving one person."

Though nearly shameless, this was true. Young Master Liang was momentarily speechless. Zhang Xin looked at the woman on the ground—barely in her early twenties; face gaunt; sallow skin with an unhealthy flush. Clearly ill. Young Master Liang ordered servants to buy some steamed buns for her. He also distributed coins to surrounding refugees.

"Let's buy her." Guo Yi felt sympathetic.

Xiao Zishan thought this wasn't ideal—she was sick; her children were too young—just burdens. He hesitated—seeing everyone watching him—nodded: "Buy them!"

Seeing these merchants purchase the whole family, the refugees grew agitated. Word spread quickly. Old, young, male, female—they pressed forward, surrounding them increasingly densely—all begging: take them; no payment needed; just food.

Chaos briefly ensued. Fortunately, Liu Gang had experience—pushed through with the escorts—requested officials and militia to help maintain order. Xiao Zishan had Gao Ju's calling card—immediately tipped several thousand coins. Officials dared not delay—quickly summoned licensed dealers—assembly-line-style writing slave contracts.

Surrounding people quickly noticed: these buyers strongly preferred children—especially previously unwanted toddlers. Seeing one, buying one. Parents wanting to accompany were also accepted. Orphans especially welcome. Zhang Xin was generous—giving no "body price" but tipping present officials 500 coins per purchase. Officials in charge simply grabbed every orphan in the area—willing or not—writing contracts. Before long: seventy to eighty children collected, plus forty-some adults. Dealers, seeing these wealthy buyers ignoring their merchandise, hurried over offering sales. Zhang Xin shook his head: "Inspecting them individually wastes time. All your children—I'll take the lot."

After bargaining, the dealers' forty-one girls—all purchased at ten *liang* each. Instantly, the ruined-temple clearing was packed with seated people.

Xiao Zishan sent escorts to notify Sun Kecheng: clear a mule-and-horse inn; quickly prepare fires and cooking; summon several doctors on standby. Contract-signed people—twenty per batch—were escorted by two escorts to the inn. The sick or weak—mule carts were hired.

Amid the bustle, a servant approached, speaking to Liu Gang. Liu Gang, expression respectful, came to Xiao Zishan: "Young Master Liang would like to invite you gentlemen for a chat."

Guo Yi asked: "Who is this Young Master Liang?"

Liu Gang said: "He's a county *juren* *(successful examination candidate)*. Gentry-family background. Known for public-spirited generosity—very good reputation locally. He'd like to talk with you gentlemen."

Several exchanged glances—such local gentry was worth cultivating. Zhang Xin stayed to continue arranging servant dispatch. Others followed the servant to the edge of the grounds.

At the wasteland's edge: a tea stall selling tea and steamed buns—originally the dealers' and officials' rest area. Now entirely replaced by Young Master Liang's servants—twenty to thirty people. Everyone wondered: just a county *juren*, yet such an entourage!

This Young Master Liang—roughly twenty-seven or twenty-eight—had a slightly pale complexion and a young aristocrat's appearance. He wore a gray silk robe and held a gold-speckled Sichuan fan. Not extravagant—but neat and immaculate. Seeing them approach, he didn't act haughty—stood, cupped hands, and greeted first:

"Liang Cunhou." The young gentleman smiled faintly—dark pupils beneath his indented brows glittered as he spoke: "May I ask your names, gentlemen? Where do you come from?"

While speaking, his gaze subtly appraised Guo Yi and others. His eyes were extremely shrewd. Guo Yi was startled: this person's penetrating look wasn't typical of dandies. He replied courteously: "We dare not presume." He introduced everyone's names in turn.

Per the standard cover story: they were sea merchants. Owing to unsafe waters, they were stranded here. Liu Gang was accompanying them sightseeing.

Servants brought tea. Young Master Liang then asked: "Since you're sea merchants, why buy so many servants?" His eyes showed suspicion.

Xiao Zishan had responses ready: "Seas have been rough these years. Business grows harder daily. We've been thinking of buying land, establishing estates, collecting rent. We've bought wasteland in Qiongzhou for farming—but labor's scarce. Our tenants and laborers often lack spouses—so we came here to buy some women."

"That's also a good deed." Young Master Liang sighed. "Watching you earlier—pitying the weak and sick, refusing to separate families, accepting even toddlers—then carefully arranging food and shelter—truly benevolent hearts. We Guangzhou natives are ashamed!"

"Not at all, not at all." Guo Yi and others demurred politely—also feeling Young Master Liang was somewhat theatrical. Travelers from modern times didn't fully understand ancient society's harshness. Since they'd bought people as servants, providing food and shelter seemed the minimum. Not paying wages already felt like taking huge advantage.

Liu Gang seized the opportunity for flattery: "Young Master Liang has always been philanthropically generous throughout the county. Not just Nanhai County—throughout Guangzhou Prefecture, who doesn't know your great benevolence? You should know: this gruel-dispensing shelter's expenses are mostly funded by Master Liang's household."

Liang Cunhou dismissed this with a wave: "Times are unsettled. Fortunately, Guangdong remains peaceful. My Liang family has long received imperial grace—not comparable to humble origins. Having some modest property—contributing what little we can for good deeds is merely slightly relieving the court's burdens. Regrettably, in this humble county, my refugee relief efforts have actually drawn criticism from local gentry." He sighed deeply.

Guo Yi, seeing his distress, feigned confusion: "Young Master Liang relieves refugees—a tremendous good deed. Why would there be gossip?"
