# Chapter 1651 - The Vessels

A large logistics depot could be established in Foshan Town—a hub for the collection and distribution of supplies. Hong Huangnan pondered, leveraging its geographical advantages to procure military provisions on a massive scale: rice, miscellaneous grains, livestock, fruits, cloth... and to distribute these supplies with ease.

His mind raced. Some of the procured materials could be processed directly in Foshan, while the rest would be shipped to Hong Kong for processing. The purchased unhusked rice would be milled into brown rice at the depot's grain mill and stored, then polished into white rice for distribution before being issued to the troops. According to the nutritional theories proposed by Chen Sigen, the Fubo Army no longer consumed brown rice. The reason was that brown rice required more time to cook, wasting fuel, and was difficult to digest, requiring extensive chewing for proper absorption. On the battlefield, there was obviously no time for lengthy cooking and eating.

Beyond grain, vegetables could also be procured and processed locally in Foshan—dried or pickled to supply the troops. If transportation time did not exceed seventy-two hours, fresh vegetables could simply be shipped directly to the frontline units.

As for meat, eggs, and even confectionery, Hong Huangnan had concepts for manufacturing them on-site using local raw materials. Especially meat—with a rapid and convenient waterborne supply system, they might not even need to consider cured or preserved foods. He could leverage his expertise in fine cuisine to prepare dishes with longer shelf lives for the soldiers at the front.

Having finished the schematic, Hong Huangnan returned to his desk. The *wugeng ji*—the "fifth-watch chicken" stew—had begun to emit an enticing aroma. He picked up the tea his secretary had brought, took a sip, and opened the freshly delivered folder. Inside were hull line drawings for several new types of river vessels, specially designed and built by the Transmigrators' shipbuilding industry for the Guangdong Campaign.

Guangdong itself was not lacking in river vessels. On the waterway between Guangzhou and the Pearl River estuary alone, at least three to four thousand boats of various inland and coastal-hybrid types were anchored year-round. Excluding fishing boats, flower boats, and other small craft, most were usable for cargo and passenger transport. Though their cargo capacity was limited, their drafts were shallow enough to navigate most of the main channels and tributaries of the East, West, and North Rivers. Local coastal merchant vessels were also plentiful and could be requisitioned without much difficulty.

Yet Hong Huangnan was not particularly satisfied with these boats. They were all sailing vessels without exception, and their cargo holds were not suited to the standardized packing crates widely used by the Joint Logistics Department. Though they would need to make extensive use of these vessels for transport in the short term, it was still necessary to build a dedicated core transport fleet of their own.

In Hong Huangnan's estimation, these specialized vessels should not only be motorized but also possess a degree of protection—particularly against incendiary attacks from the riverbanks. This was a lesson learned from experience: during the Pearl River Estuary Breakthrough Campaign, the Marine Corps had made extensive use of captured wooden boats, and most vessel losses in combat were caused by the enemy's incendiary weapons. For this reason, none of these new vessels would be designed with sails in mind.

At first, he had focused his attention on the existing naval vessels, particularly the motorized *sanfa* boats. These small craft had shallow drafts and were equipped with small steam engines—ideal shallow-water vessels. Additionally, the Type 621 paddlewheel tugboat was also highly suitable for river operations. According to intelligence reports, the Type 621 could sail without difficulty all the way to Wuzhou, and might even proceed further upstream to Nanning.

Using Type 621 tugs to tow barges would allow for the large-scale transport of supplies and personnel. This was roughly the blueprint for Hong Huangnan's envisioned "waterborne supply column." But it was not enough.

For the main channels of the three rivers, the 621's "supply column" could move unimpeded. But in certain upper reaches and many tributaries, the 621 was simply too large. What was needed were smaller steamboats with even shallower drafts for transport and towing operations. Such small steamers had remained active on many of China's rivers well into the 1980s.

Beyond transport vessels, small river gunboats were also required—to protect shipping lanes, suppress river pirates, provide fire support for landing parties during combat, and intimidate riverside villages.

These combined requirements became a challenge for the shipyard's esteemed colleagues. Since Shi Jiantao had volunteered for the project, it was assigned to him for hands-on management. As for the designer, naturally it was the sole Chief Designer of the "Central Ship Design Institute," Zhong Ziheng.

Following coordination between the General Military Affairs Council and the Planning Commission, the vessel designs would be done in Lingao, while actual construction would take place in Hong Kong. Engines and guns would, of course, still be shipped from Lingao.

The first line drawing Hong Huangnan opened was for the Type 621 "Inland." The "Inland" designation meant it was specifically intended for river navigation. Zhong Ziheng had made only minor modifications from the original 621 design—primarily replacing the engine with a smaller one to save hold space, reducing coal bunker capacity, and switching the paddlewheel from a side-mounted configuration to a stern wheel to accommodate shallower waterways.

However, the 621 itself had been designed based on the deep-draft requirements of coastal and Pearl River main channels. The hull lines had never been optimized for shallow-water operation. Though the smaller engine and other measures had reduced the draft, the vessel's navigable range remained limited. Hong Huangnan reviewed the specifications—roughly speaking, only on the West River could it travel unimpeded, running all the way to Wuzhou without difficulty.

The second line drawing was for an iron-framed, wooden-hulled river gunboat. By the five-hundred-ton dividing line, its 260-ton standard displacement qualified it merely as a "boat."

This was a river gunboat "meticulously designed" by Zhong Ziheng, modeled on the Western powers' gunboats that patrolled the Yangtze in the 1920s and '30s. These gunboats, with their dual requirements for "riot suppression" and "intimidation," were typically armed with large-caliber main guns and a considerable number of light rapid-fire weapons. Their speed surpassed that of wooden vessels on the river. Due to the need to pass through the Three Gorges during the dry season and enter the Sichuan interior, their drafts were generally very shallow.

These technical requirements aligned perfectly with the General Staff's river operations in Guangdong. Thus, this Type 798 river gunboat was designed by Zhong Ziheng precisely to meet these needs. Its principal dimensions were: length 54.86 meters, beam 8.23 meters, draft 0.79 meters. It was equipped with two 500-horsepower reciprocating steam engines and two coal-fired boilers, with a crew of fifty-six. When necessary, it could transport a platoon of soldiers. The 798 made no concessions to seaworthiness whatsoever, employing a shallow-draft inland hull form with extremely low freeboard. Due to limited hull space, the 798 shared a common feature of such river gunboats: an exceptionally long and large superstructure. Combined with its tall twin funnels and the massive casemate of the 130mm muzzle-loading rifled gun, the entire vessel appeared top-heavy.

Yet this very design enabled it to navigate most of the waterways of the East, West, and North Rivers, as well as a considerable number of tributaries. With its "towering" silhouette and "great guns," its appearance on any stretch of river would exert overwhelming intimidation on the local powers. When necessary, it could also be used to deploy army troops and transport supplies. Though the hull used iron framing with wooden planking, all major compartments exposed above the waterline were fitted with hot-rolled thin steel plates as armor. Except for Red Barbarian cannons, it was completely immune at close range to most Ming military firearms.

Hong Huangnan was quite satisfied with the river gunboat—though given his understanding of the Planning Commission's miserly disposition, he harbored doubts about how many dedicated 798-type river gunboats the Commission would ultimately approve for construction. Personally, however, he was a strong supporter of this new weapon type. Compared to the thousand-pound siege guns that many transmigrators boasted about, a river gunboat anchored in White Goose Pool would be far more persuasive.

As if to form a contrast with the river gunboat, the next drawing depicted a small river patrol boat that the Planning Commission would obviously adore. It was modeled on the twenty-five-ton inland gunboats that the Japanese Army had used extensively in China—vessels with virtually unlimited navigability. During the War of Resistance, they could be seen everywhere, from the small rivers of Jiangnan to the creeks of Guangdong. On the Yangtze, it went without saying, and the PLA had even used them in offshore operations to support the liberation of coastal islands. The surviving hulls had continued to serve as utility vessels along the Yangtze until the 1990s.

The problem was that these small boats used internal combustion engines, an area where Lingao's industrial capacity remained relatively weak. The design proposal called for a compact eighteen-horsepower steam engine, scaled up from a twelve-horsepower design brought by Li Di from American steam enthusiast hobbyists. Naturally, both speed and range were significantly affected. The full specifications were: length 18.1 meters, beam 3.5 meters, full-load displacement 30 tons, armed with one 70mm Type 32 battalion gun in its naval version—which could also be mounted on wheels as an infantry gun.

"This patrol boat is hideously ugly," Hong Huangnan couldn't help but comment.

Ugly as it was, it would be a highly useful little craft. The "waterborne supply column" would indeed need such flexible and inexpensive armed boats for escort duties.

Finally, there was the so-called Type 1024 inland steamboat. Evidently, Chief Designer Zhong had not expended much mental effort on it—he had simply copied existing design data, replacing the powerplant with an eighteen-horsepower small steam engine and adding a coal bunker. Otherwise, it was identical to the "small steamers" that had plied China's inland waterways throughout the twentieth century. The Type 1024 employed a flat-bottomed, low-freeboard conventional shallow-draft design. Though unremarkable in appearance and average in performance, its navigational adaptability was strong—convenient and flexible to operate. Hong Huangnan decided to use this type as the Joint Logistics' motorized transport force.

"That should about cover it—best to build a batch of all of them," Hong Huangnan drew a circle around his own name and placed the folder back in the tray. He made a rough mental calculation of how many vessels of each type would be needed.

However, he was somewhat worried. It was already early autumn, and the offensive was scheduled to launch in just over three months. He had no idea how many of these new vessel types would be ready for deployment by then. He knew nothing about the efficiency of the Hong Kong Shipyard, nor had any progress reports been sent to him.
