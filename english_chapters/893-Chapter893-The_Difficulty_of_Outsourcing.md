# Chapter 893 - The Difficulty of Outsourcing

Hong Kong Island, Hong Kong Shipyard.

Sea breeze brushed the coastline of Saintess Bay, where sand slipways and simple gantry cranes lined up looked majestic. Several Harmony ships already taking shape stood on the slipways, huge ribs pointing to the sky like rows of saplings. Many workers climbed on scaffolds, banging and installing materials.

Keels of six Harmony ships had been laid. Workers were installing ribs—keels and ribs all came from the Ma'niao Iron and Steel Complex. Although to save man-hours, ship keels used wrought iron instead of steel.

Not far from the slipways was a patch of simple bamboo sheds. This was the shipyard's temporary office. To complete the Harmony ships in time, Shi Jiantao threw all labor quotas and materials into factory area construction; "non-urgent" infrastructure like offices was all compressed.

"Your sample is unqualified." Shi Jiantao sighed, putting down the tape measure and protractor. He looked at the wooden rack on one side of the shed, piled with the latest batch of foreign samples sent for testing by various indigenous shipyards. He sighed again.

On the workbench before him was a rib plate for a Harmony ship. It had a standard code compiled according to the newly implemented standard code system: Usage is a hull plate for Harmony 800 Standard Model Port Midship, material is fir.

Starting from January 1631, the shipyard in Heung-shan engaged in production while construction was ongoing. Before the Planning Commission's task was formally issued, Shi Jiantao's Hong Kong Shipyard had already preliminarily completed one Model 800 Harmony ship.

This ship was experimental, used to test if his idea was qualified. The result then was quite encouraging; from starting to manufacture the first standard part to the whole ship completing launch, the entire construction period took less than 50 days. A considerable portion of parts were produced by Lingao's wood processing plant and then transported to Hong Kong.

At that time, Hong Kong was already building a new timber processing plant. Shi Jiantao's calculating plan was: once this plant was completed, he could utilize Guangdong's rich timber resources nearby—floating rafts directly down the Pearl River to Hong Kong.

Precisely based on such consideration, Shi Jiantao had the guts and insight to pound his chest and accept the Planning Commission's order—of course, the speed displayed by Bopu Shipyard on Project 901 strengthened his belief. The prototype of Project 901 was claimed to be combat-ready in three months. Bopu Shipyard lacked sufficiently skilled hands and experience in building such ships, but with the help of mechanized production and modern management, the lead ship of Project 901 also completed launch roughly within 90 days. Of course fitting out took another period of time.

According to Shi Jiantao's idea, except for keels, ribs, and some parts requiring higher processing precision manufactured by Lingao, other materials would all be outsourced to Hong Kong Shipyard and indigenous workshops in the Pearl River Delta.

Currently, rib installation progress was already halfway done. Hong Kong's timber processing plant successfully entered production. Purchasing shipbuilding materials like timber, flax, cloth, lime, tung oil, and oakum in Guangdong proceeded smoothly with the assistance of the Guangzhou Station. Through the Guangzhou Station, a batch of shipwrights and carpenters were also recruited from the Pearl River Delta, receiving training while working.

However looked at, the Harmony Ship plan felt like it was progressing smoothly. But sweat beads on Shi Jiantao's forehead increased drop by drop.

Starting from the delivery inspection of the first batch of outsourced product samples last month, sweat beads began appearing on his forehead.

The shopkeepers of shipbuilding workshops recruited through Guangzhou Station were very enthusiastic about outsourcing shipbuilding parts—who didn't want to hook up with the Australians to do business! If nothing else, just their strength in besieging Guangzhou and burning the Five Rams Relay Station made everyone want to curry favor. Moreover, Australians were famous in the business world for being "Honest and Reliable Young Gentlemen" who kept their word.

Now being able to prepare materials for their ships was simply a pie falling from the sky—the reputation of Australians having various strange ships had long spread; everyone wanted to learn a thing or two from it. Moreover, since rumors said the Imperial Court was about to issue a decree blockading trade with Macau, fewer people came to build ships in the Pearl River Delta area; many shipyards hadn't opened business for months. Now that the Australians wanted to build ships, everyone wanted a share of the soup.

Shi Jiantao gave sample parts of various outsourced ship materials and specific dimensions to the outsourcing shipyards. As for blueprints, he didn't give them—not for technical secrecy, but because no one among the shipyard artisans could read blueprints; many were illiterate.

But the work of outsourcing ship materials proceeded very unsmoothly. When the first batch of outsourced parts was sent back for inspection on time, dimension discrepancy problems appeared immediately.

Ship material parts for wooden ships had relatively loose requirements for tolerances and didn't need overly precise processing. But this batch of outsourced parts not only had completely mismatched curvature, but tolerances were also large to an unacceptable degree. Even among the three trial products submitted by each workshop, tolerances between them were extremely large. Let alone comparing with the sample.

Shi Jiantao issued a yellow card on the spot, telling them to go back and "rectify." He emphasized repeatedly that he wanted parts "exactly the same" as the sample.

The shopkeepers patted their chests expressing they completely understood his meaning and went back. A few days later they sent three new samples. Results were still no go.

"However long that board is, you must make it that long; however wide, make it that wide. Not a hair's breadth of error. Also the shape, must be exactly identical, understand?" He said tirelessly.

So there was this third sample submission. Shi Jiantao was like a student with bad grades but still having to try hard for the exam, hoping this time would yield a passable result.

"This time it's definitely the same. All made by our master foreman." The shopkeeper guaranteed repeatedly.

Inspection results were still much larger than allowed tolerances. Shi Jiantao looked at the shopkeeper who was terrified and craning his neck to watch the result, and couldn't help shaking his head.

"Can't be, look, isn't this piece exactly the same as the sample you gave, sir?" The shopkeeper was very afraid of the "Australian," but failing three times in a row, he felt somewhat anxious inside—his shipyard had thirty to fifty people waiting to start work and eat. They hadn't had business for a long time; if they couldn't do the Australians' business, let alone making money, maintaining the stall would be difficult.

Without using measuring tools, relying only on the naked eye, the shape and dimensions this time weren't much different from the sample. But under measuring tools, the gap in dimensions still showed up.

"Still have a gap." Shi Jiantao wiped the sweat on his head in some dilemma. What to do? The outsourcing business he imagined beautifully was like a soap bubble, colorful but bursting one by one before his eyes.

If he let them go back to rectify now, the next batch would probably be the same. Shi Jiantao suddenly realized he had consistently ignored a problem: although the parts he outsourced to indigenous shipyards were all the simplest components, standard "rough work," these "rough works" under the premise of standardized manufacturing all had relatively high tolerance requirements.

Satisfying tolerance requirements required better production tools and precise measuring tools. And these were nonexistent in these indigenous shipyards. Shi Jiantao had conducted on-site inspections of indigenous shipyards; seeing carpenters relying solely on crude saws, axes, and simple iron tools, what kind of products they could manufacture was self-evident. Without precise measuring tools, naturally they couldn't achieve accurate grasp of dimensions.

This wasn't the 21st century where standardized production equipment and measuring tools were all easily available things. Even for a small electronics factory or small machinery factory in the countryside with incomplete equipment, as long as the contracting party had enough business, the boss could very quickly purchase necessary equipment from the market to immediately organize production.

In comparison, shipyards in this time-space had nothing. They didn't even have the basic concept of standardized production. To make their products usable, it seemed impossible without spending great effort to help them rectify, or even upgrade process equipment.

This way it returned to the old path of training workers himself. Shi Jiantao simply wanted to tear his hair out. He racked his brains tossing around for so long; if he stumbled on building the H-800, needless to say, he would become a "braggart" in the future, carrying a stain that couldn't be washed away. One must know that requesting to come to Hong Kong to set up a shipyard, building Harmony ships, and outsourced production after standardization were all his proposals.

"Review starting tomorrow, bring all your workers to me." Shi Jiantao had to make a helpless decision in his helplessness. "We'll teach them how to work, understand?"

"Yes, yes." The shopkeeper nodded repeatedly. Muttering inside: he was happy to learn how Australians worked, but who paid for food? Dozens of people running to this small island to eat, drink, and poop all cost money?

Shi Jiantao naturally understood his thoughts, but he was unwilling. According to old time-space rules, inspections and such were charged; as for training, you had to pay training fees in reverse. Even in this time-space, apprentices only ate for free, absolutely no logic of getting wages. However, right now was a time of needing people. Although shipyard artisans weren't very suitable, they were better than new naturalized citizens with zero woodworking foundation—besides, there weren't many naturalized citizens available to allocate to him right now.

"Your people come over, food and lodging fully covered by us. Learn on the job."

Just like that, before evening, he reached a "commissioned training" agreement with the shopkeeper and foreman of the first indigenous shipyard accepting outsourcing work. The agreement was for one month. During this period, food and lodging expenses were covered by Hong Kong Shipyard, and shipwrights learned on the job.

Shi Jiantao thought, even if they couldn't learn, at least they did a month of work. If it still didn't work out, he would have to think of other ways.
