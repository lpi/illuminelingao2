# Chapter 289 Sweet Port Turbulence – Confrontation

"That's right!" Wen Tong was also exhausted by this relentless commercial warfare. "Even if Guangzhou sends the silver, how many days will it last? Sooner or later we have to show our hand! With Bei Wei's men here, why not just wipe out Haiyi Hall in one go and see what other tricks they can pull?!"

"Snipe Haiyi Hall's leaders and call it divine punishment!"

"Too bad Bei Wei isn't back yet. Don't know where he wandered off to. Can't reach him either!"

"He's been out for over two weeks; he should be back soon. Besides, the Executive Committee surely has ways to contact him." Wen Tong had made up his mind. "We'll radio the Executive Committee tonight, demanding decisive measures to strike back against the enemy's provocation."

This essentially reclassified Haiyi Hall from a commercial competitor to an "enemy." And Uncle Lei Feng had long ago explained very clearly how to treat enemies.

"I say we just go all the way. Have Bei Wei lead a special ops raid on Haiyi Hall, kill one or two ringleaders, and the rest will naturally be terrified. Then we go in, buy up their assets at low prices, and instantly unify the Leizhou sugar market!"

"That's too vicious. It's practically robbery." Xiao Gui immediately objected. "Besides, Leizhou people aren't fools. If we do that, everyone will know we're the black hand behind it. Keeping the local gentry and officials terrified and guarded against us will make future work difficult."

"True. Killing one person or burning some assets to show them we're tough should be enough. They'll naturally back down. If they want to play for real, we're not afraid either."

"This isn't good. After all, they are indigenous national capitalists. Isn't us doing this a bit like a monopoly bullying the market?" Mei Lin, the moderate, hesitantly raised an objection.

"They are the monopoly group," Wen Tong said. "Why don't you offer a suggestion then, old man?"

"Hmm, I was thinking," Mei Lin said. "We can use both the carrot and the stick. Haiyi Hall is trying to squeeze us out for profit, but they haven't used extreme measures yet. If we suddenly go for the kill—whether killing people or burning houses—it's a bit excessive, right?" seeing everyone looking at him with disdain, he felt compelled to continue since he'd already started, "Take killing, for instance. If you kill someone, people fear you, and the crisis might pass. But a feud is forged—everyone has family, relatives, friends. There are always a few hard bones or desperate ones. What if they pull the same trick on us later? You can be a thief for a thousand days, but you can't guard against a thief for a thousand days."

"Then kill them too. What's there to be afraid of! Men, women, old, young—kill them all! Leave not even chickens or dogs!" Wen Tong's face was dark and murderous. It seemed that when intellectuals got bloodthirsty, they were more terrifying than ordinary brutes.

"Kill them all?!" Mei Lin disapproved even more. "Rooting out weeds isn't that easy. Besides, the methods are too cruel; it'll incite public anger. If you were a commoner, would you want to deal with a company that kills people at the drop of a hat and wipes out whole families?"

Everyone felt there was reason in this. Chen Tianxiong said: "Old Mei makes sense, but right now being reasonable doesn't help. Do you have any ideas?"

"I do have an idea, though I don't know if it'll work," Mei Lin said. "Why not just go talk to Haiyi Hall? They've seen our factory's processing capacity. There's actually room for cooperation. Tempt these sugar merchants with joint shareholding. That way, the resistance to our controlling the Leizhou sugar industry would be much smaller."

"However," Mei Lin turned his tone, "since we've already shown our hand like this, Haiyi Hall will nine out of ten want to chase us to the end. Going to negotiate now definitely won't yield results."

"After all that, you just spoke a pile of nonsense." Wen Tong felt disappointed.

"Humph, I never agreed with rushing to Leizhou to open a branch anyway," Mei Lin said dismissively. "Our power isn't big enough yet, and our prestige isn't enough to 'awe the petty criminals' along the coast. Coming to Leizhou to make money looking like a big fat sheep—it'd be weird if we didn't get fleeced."

"Enough 'I told you so's'—" Chen Tianxiong said. "Talking about it just makes us annoyed and doesn't help..."

Just as they were at their wits' end, someone suddenly reported: "Someone from Guangzhou has arrived!"

Everyone's spirits lifted. Wen Tong quickly said: "Invite them in, quick!"
Wu De's arrival was a shot of adrenaline for everyone. Especially seeing that the Executive Committee had sent a leader of Executive Committee member rank personally to transport silver for the Leizhou Sugar Industry Company, the previously panic-stricken mood stabilized.

"Everyone relax." Wu De knew what they were thinking as soon as he saw their expressions. "Silver? We have plenty. The Executive Committee will find ways to mobilize it for you. We will definitely win this sugar war."

He then handed a receipt for fifty thousand *liang* of silver to Wen Tong for him to sign. This sum would later be offset by sugar Wen Tong provided.

Hearing that fifty thousand *liang* of silver had arrived at Hai'an Port, and with Wu De's assurances—since the Executive Committee always had plenty of silver—everyone breathed a sigh of relief. Chen Tianxiong, who was socially experienced, knew that since the *Ascending Peace Island* had only brought fifty thousand, the money definitely hadn't come as easily as Wu De claimed.

"Alright, let's talk about the current situation," Wu De said.

Wen Tong outlined the situation roughly. Since the squeeze began, they had bought 3,500 *shi* of sugar. This rate was the result of South China deliberately slowing down, but the consequence of slowing down was that the crush of people at the gate was getting worse.

"We're all worried. Now, outside South China's gate, there are one or two thousand people and hundreds of oxen stranded almost every day. The ground is covered with filth, the stench is terrible. The weather is getting hotter; if things go wrong, an epidemic could break out.

"With so many people gathering, all sorts of rumors are flying, which is very disadvantageous for us.

"There's at least one hundred fifty thousand *shi* of sugar outside waiting to be sold to us. If we continue to buy this slowly, it will lead to two results: one, the cane farmers will suffer losses because the pressed sugar spoils; two, they won't be able to wait and will have to sell to Haiyi Hall's sugar trading houses at the one *liang* five *qian* price. We lose either way."

Wu De frowned: "Is the situation that bad?"

"Yes. Some heavily indebted farmers probably can't hold out much longer. We've learned a lot these past few days. Those farmers who borrowed money are being pressed hard by creditors and are desperate to liquidate."

The last scenario was what Wen Tong was most unwilling to see. Once it became reality, the reputation South China had earned by maintaining the original purchase price these days would vanish completely. Not only would Haiyi Hall take the profit from the low-priced sugar, but South China's reputation would be ruined.

Wu De listened carefully. Finally, when asking about their countermeasures, Wen Tong didn't hide anything and told him the result of their discussion:

"One is to open the gates wide and buy as fast as possible. In the end, we gain both fame and profit. Of course, this is premised on being able to mobilize enough silver." Wen Tong touched his forehead. "This would naturally make everyone happy, and our situation would be easy to expand in the future. If there's no silver, the consensus is we have to use violent means. It's effective immediately, but cleaning up the mess afterward will be strenuous."

After finishing, he added: "It's reached a life-or-death point for South China in Leizhou. The Executive Committee must make up its mind quickly!"

"The Executive Committee has already made up its mind." Wu De knew he absolutely couldn't say anything discouraging at this moment. "You speed up acquisitions. The Executive Committee will move heaven and earth to raise the money. You must hold your ground here. Use violent means with caution; they are easy to use but hard to clean up after! The more critical the moment, the more calm you must be. Never give others a pretext. We must secure the fruit of this year's Leizhou sugar!" He thought for a moment. "I'll return to Lingao tonight and request an emergency meeting to discuss this."

"Good, that's best." Hearing the big shot from the Executive Committee willing to beat his chest in guarantee, Wen Tong's spirits lifted. "As long as the Executive Committee is determined, we're reassured. Tomorrow we'll increase the purchasing speed."

"Roughly how many *shi* per day can you do?"

"Right now it's seven to eight hundred *shi*. If we open up and speed it up, fifteen hundred *shi* a day is no problem."

Fifteen hundred *shi* a day—fifty thousand *liang* could last about half a month. Half a month—Wu De estimated Guangzhou could definitely mobilize enough funds by then.

Wen Tong instructed Liao Dahua and the others to prepare ox carts, laborers, and escorts to go to Hai'an Port to transport the silver.

"Should we transport it at night? That way Haiyi Hall won't know our depth," Mei Lin said.

Chen Tianxiong said: "No need. Haiyi Hall already knows our hand. Hai'an Street is their territory; our little tricks can't hide from them."

Liao Dahua was also happy to hear that a large sum of silver had arrived. Unlike Wen Tong and the others, he had a blind worship for Proprietor Guo in Guangzhou. Hearing now that a ship from Guangzhou had brought silver, he felt even more that this proprietor had immense energy. He chimed in: "It's inconvenient to transport silver at night. It's dark, the porters can't see, and the journey isn't short. It's hard for the escorts to protect it. Better to do it in the day. Fifty thousand *liang* is a big number no matter what. People outside are jittery right now; might as well show it off!"

Wu De nodded approvingly: "Right. Let's just show it off and demonstrate our resolve. Since the war is on, we have to fight until everyone in Leizhou Prefecture, high and low, is convinced!"

"There's one more thing," Wen Tong said. "We have a large stock of sugar now. Since the *Ascending Peace Island* is here, why not ship a boatload of sugar to Guangzhou? Guo Yi said it can be liquidated once it gets there..."

"Right, right," Wu De knocked his own head. "I forgot this angle. We can totally buy and sell at the same time. Shipping it in small batches like this might even maintain the price. But this involves ship allocation issues; I'll discuss it when I get back."

Zhu An had been staying at Haiyi Hall all day these past few days. First, to monitor South China's movements constantly—it wasn't convenient with people coming and going at his residence. Second, to bolster the morale of the various sugar trading houses. Seeing that farmers weren't coming to sell sugar and the warehouses were empty, the torment was indeed hard for ordinary people to bear. After all, the crushing season was only three months long. Now half of it was gone, yet the twenty-one trading houses had collected less than fifty thousand *shi*. Any trading house manager would be anxious. Managers or owners often couldn't sit still and came here to complain. Third Master Zhu tirelessly comforted and reassured them. Thanks to his usual prestige, everyone trusted him, and he managed to maintain the situation.

Developments had gone exactly as Third Master Zhu predicted. As the trading houses under Haiyi Hall adjusted their sugar prices, almost all cane farmers flocked to South China. Only in the first few days did a few uninformed farmers painfully sell sugar on Hai'an Street. After that, sugar sellers almost completely vanished.

The ambushes he'd planted among the sugar sellers hadn't had a chance to exert force yet. Although there had been an opportunity for Zhao the Chicken Foot's riffraff to smash South China's situation on the first day of the price change, the other side had reacted quickly and controlled the situation immediately. The few informants he had placed inside South China had also all been replaced. Though losing these informants was a pity, it didn't affect the big picture. These days, he not only had people watching South China constantly, sending back a steady stream of reports on various movements, but he had also gone to look personally a few times. Third Master Zhu knew South China couldn't hold out much longer.

There were two reasons. First, everyone knew South China had sent people out to borrow money. This was the clearest sign—if cash wasn't tight, no one would pay high interest. Second, he noticed that in the last two days, although South China kept four scales at the weighing station, only three were in regular use. The other one was used only occasionally.

South China slowing down the weighing speed only proved their cash reserves had reached a critical stage of emptiness, forcing them to use the tactic of slowing down to linger on.

Third Master Zhu knew the time to deliver the fatal blow was approaching. Within three days, South China Trading House would completely collapse at his hands.

The only pity was that according to the reports from the person he sent to Guangzhou, South China seemed to have quite a connection with the Gao family of Guangzhou. He had heard of Gao Ju; he was a wealthy merchant with connections to sea merchants. With such a relationship, he had to hold back the ruthless moves he had originally planned. Although he wasn't afraid of the Gao family, it was better to have fewer such powerful enemies.

Fortunately, even without those methods, the remaining moves were enough to make South China shut down. At this moment, he was instructing his subordinates.

"Take people everywhere and find the big households that lent money to the cane farmers. Tell them to step up pressure on the farmers to repay debts!" Third Master Zhu's eyes shone.

"Yes, Third Master!" The assignee agreed readily but hesitated slightly. "But Third Master, it's natural for creditors to press for debts, but if South China collapses, the farmers will simply have to sell at one *liang* five *qian*. Will the creditors worry that the farmers won't be able to pay back the debts—"
