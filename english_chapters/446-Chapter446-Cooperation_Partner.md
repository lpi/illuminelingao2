# Chapter 446 Cooperation Partner

"Yes, Qiuhong was once the fence for a bandit in the county. After we exterminated that bandit, this wealth fell cheaply into Qiuhong's hands."

"Does Chen Minggang know about this?"

"Of course he knows. However, I understand some of their *jianghu* rules now," Zhou Botao reported. "For this kind of thing, customarily the Fast Squad and Militia Squad should have a share. Chen Minggang should have at least taken out a portion for the two squads to 'smell.' Swallowing it directly like this, they call it 'hurting the Tao.' Speaking of it, it's a very serious matter."

"Let's not release this matter for now. Wait until we need the Six Rooms to bite each other like dogs before doing it." Ran Yao said. "But if there are any small tidbits, release some first to make them infight a bit."

Zhou Botao understood perfectly. He immediately instructed his subordinates to pull out all the black materials on the Three Classes and Six Rooms collected over the past year—these materials had already accumulated quite a bit, and since Gou Er's account books were partially deciphered, many details of old past events were added, making the spread more credible. He selected some suitable ones and spread them one by one in complete sets.

A wind of suspicion immediately began to blow in the Lingao County Yamen. Lingao was a small place; rumors didn't take a day to travel from East Gate Market to the county town. The "public duty" crowd in the county couldn't help but mutter—people who ate the yamen's public rice had particularly many schemes. Many old matters were fine if not mentioned, but once mentioned, all kinds of past suspicions floated up.

Besides these rumors, news that Chen Minggang prepared to let the Australians undertake this year's tax collection also spread. This news was released by Chen Minggang's apprentice on his orders. If this succeeded, needless to say; even if the Australians didn't prepare to wade into this muddy water, he intended to use the tiger's might to scare people with this big signboard—anyway, it was unlikely anyone dared to ask the Australians if this was true. Afterwards, he could just make up a portion of the money and grain to the Australians.

Wang Zhaomin had no interest in these rumors, but he broke out in a sweat over Chen Minggang trying to pull the Australians to undertake tax collection. This matter was now rumored vividly, so it probably wasn't baseless. He hurriedly summoned Chen Minggang and asked him sternly if there was such a thing.

"There is indeed such a thing." Chen Minggang answered openly. Although he held a respectful posture before Private Secretary Wang, his expression was extremely arrogant—clerks in such remote places, because local administration relied heavily on them, didn't even put the Magistrate in their eyes, let alone a private secretary like Wang Zhaomin.

"You have such bold gall!" Wang Zhaomin was so angry his beard scattered. "What background do the Hair Bandits have? You dare to collude with them? When the Imperial Court's heavenly army comes in the future, let's see how you dissociate yourself!"

"Replying to Private Secretary Wang, if I can't dissociate myself then, naturally there are people taller than this lowly one to prop it up." Chen Minggang put on a rascal's face.

Wang Zhaomin was instantly choked speechless. Speaking of which, in this Lingao County Yamen, who could claim to be clean and have no dealings with the Hair Bandits? Probably couldn't be counted. For petty clerks, it was easy to explain away taking a few circulation coupons, but for someone like him, when the time came, he feared he couldn't explain it clearly.

Wang Zhaomin was after all a veteran private secretary, very composed. He said in a deep voice: "Old Eight, I advise you to be sensible! This group of Hair Bandits is absolutely not kind. If you provoke them, I'm afraid the one who suffers in the end will only be yourself!"

"Whether I suffer or not is a matter for later. For the immediate matter, Private Secretary Wang has to come up with a way, right?" Chen Minggang showed no weakness. He naturally knew the Australians were not easy to handle, but relying on his familiarity with the whole county's money and grain, even if you Australians had sky-reaching abilities, without his help, you couldn't collect grain—"Reasonable Burden"? That thing was indeed clever, but the grain collected was extremely limited, counting only as the government's "voluntary donation," impossible to sustain long-term.

The immediate matter naturally referred to the upcoming autumn grain collection. Not only grain but also the surcharged Liao Supplies, as well as the county's miscellaneous taxes and poll money. All these things added together were the county's top priority. Wang Zhaomin had also been racking his brains over this recently.

The grain tax itself was okay; Wang Zhaomin knew that with diligent urging, it could generally be completed. Moreover, after the Australians exterminated the bandits this year, the local powerful landlords who colluded with bandits had restrained themselves a lot. Openly opposing the government was something they probably wouldn't do, but now they had a better choice—the Australians.

If they openly used the Australians as backing—this wasn't impossible, just as they colluded with bandits in the past—grain collection would become very difficult again.

It seemed that no matter what, without cooperating with the Australians, there would likely be huge trouble with this autumn tax. Thinking of this, he couldn't help secretly hating Chen Minggang for his own selfish gain, going to the Australians to talk about autumn grain himself. Now if he wanted to talk cooperation with the Australians, he feared they wouldn't pay attention to him without a high price.

Xiong Buyou returned to report the results of the talk with Chen Minggang to Wu De. Hearing that Chen Minggang also wanted to utilize the Crossing Group, Wu De was somewhat surprised—it seemed people fishing for money in boiling oil were everywhere.

"Looks like we've become a sweet pastry. Both Wang Zhaomin and Chen Minggang want to borrow our signboard." Wen Desi smiled upon hearing this.

"This way we can properly negotiate the price." Wu De said. "Wang Zhaomin originally didn't intend to cooperate with us, just hoping we'd make a gesture. Now with Chen Minggang stirring things up, he has no choice but to come. Saving us some effort."

"It looks like Chen Minggang will offer a better price."

"Should we cooperate with him?"

"I don't think that's necessary." Wu De didn't hesitate. "We didn't come to Lingao to be officials; we came to control the county yamen. There's no need to engage in so many twists and turns. Also, given our level of understanding of this society, trying to outwit them professionally, we are probably no match for this gang of clerks."

Even the Magistrate himself couldn't figure out the various official businesses in the county yamen, let alone outsiders like them. As foreign athletes competing against local athletes who knew the rules, no matter how skilled, they would still lose if they kept fouling.

To deal with this situation, only breaking it with force, destroying the old order, establishing new rules, and forcing everyone to operate under the new order they prescribed would work.

"Of course, in terms of data, we temporarily still need to rely on their expertise." Wu De said. "Temporarily don't break face with him. See to what extent this guy is sincere. We ourselves should also prepare for takeover."

"Cooperate with Wang Zhaomin?" Xiong Buyou didn't like this private secretary much; he still felt someone like Chen Minggang talking prices and conditions was more direct and straightforward.

"Of course! This is the right path." Wu De said with certainty. "Clerks are base people. We need to establish our own image; how can we mix with them? Wang Zhaomin and Wu Mingjin are dignified official lords. The status of these two in the hearts of the common people is different."

The leader is always good; it's the crooked-mouthed monks below who recite the scriptures wrong. This theory isn't unique to modern times. Since ancient times, Chinese common people have thought this way. Transmigrators wanting to reverse this wasn't something achievable overnight.

Because the autumn grain collection was imminent, various sides held a joint meeting. The meeting decided, with very Chinese characteristics, to establish a special County Yamen Leadership Working Group, directly controlled by Wu De's Civil Affairs Commission.

"Manpower and resources are at your disposal." Wen Desi said to Wu De. "You can also control the intelligence department. If necessary, dispatching the Special Reconnaissance Team is also fine—I've greeted Bei Wei. On call anytime. Concentrate strength to take down the county yamen this time!"

"The responsibility is huge." Wu De said. "But I will definitely do my best. Also, find me a few ruthless guys."

"Okay." Wen Desi said. "Whoever you want."

So Wu De transferred Zhou Dongtian over. Zhou Dongtian had been doing printing recently, his face always covered in ink. Because they were also testing lead type, he came directly to Wu De's office.

"Old Zhou," Wu De said, "I know you did odd jobs for Ran Yao. Recently you might have to do this side job on a large scale."

Zhou Dongtian grinned, revealing white teeth.

That day, Zhang Youfu came to find Xiong Buyou, saying Private Secretary Wang wanted to meet the Crossing Group's big boss secretly at his humble abode. Xiong Buyou guessed it was probably still about the autumn tax collection.

The next evening, at Zhang Youfu's manor, both sides held a secret talk: Wang Zhaomin saw that not only Xiong Buyou came but also a big boss—he recognized Wu De, knowing this person had great power among the Australians, belonging to the "Giant Scoundrel" level.

After both sides exchanged pleasantries, Wang Zhaomin cut straight to the point, asking: Is the recently rumored matter of Chen Minggang inviting you to undertake the autumn tax collection true?

"You could say there is, or say there isn't." Xiong Buyou spoke vaguely.

Wang Zhaomin cursed inwardly that this Hair Bandit was truly cunning, but had to ask patiently: "What does 'both is and isn't' mean?"

"Chen Minggang indeed came to mention this to us, but we are still deliberating and haven't reached a conclusion."

"Haven't reached a conclusion" meant there was still room for maneuver. Wang Zhaomin knew this meant bargaining. He had to summon one hundred and twenty percent of his spirit.

"What does the Noble Group intend?"

"Chen Minggang promised several conditions." Xiong Buyou said. "Very generous."

"Chen Minggang, this county termite, is just a despicable petty person. Can the Noble Group trust him?"

Xiong Buyou laughed: "We trust him. suspect he hasn't the guts to cheat us either."

Wang Zhaomin pointed out earnestly that the so-called cheating didn't refer to discrepancies in money and grain figures, but that he would use the Transmigrators to bully others outside, extorting everywhere.

"...You are new to this place and don't know much about the Great Ming or the county situation here. Base people like this have controlled county administration for more than a day; they are extremely familiar with everyone high and low. If they borrow the Noble Group's prestige to do tricks and harm the common people, it would be greatly harmful to the Noble Group's reputation!"

Wang Zhaomin knew the Australians viewed their reputation relatively importantly, so he could only try to move them from this aspect.
