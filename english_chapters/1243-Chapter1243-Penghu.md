# Chapter 1243 - Penghu

Although Kinmen was located between Anping and Xiamen, it was still 12 nautical miles from Anping. Using sailboats for maneuvering would take too long for the sea crossing and would be subject to hydrological conditions within the bay. It would be difficult to achieve the effect of a surprise attack. Motorized transport craft with an average speed of 8 knots clearly had a significant advantage in this regard.

"The crossing time is really too long. If the enemy reacts in time, they can completely reinforce from land." Ming Qiu clearly expressed concern while studying the operational plan. Although he had no experience executing amphibious operations, he knew such battles generally required speed. But a fleet dominated by sailing ships clearly couldn't achieve that. Plus, Kinmen and Xiamen were both large islands; deploying troops to attack and search on the islands would take considerable time. According to the operational plan, systematic destruction of the locality and abduction of the population were also required, which might take three or four days to complete the campaign objectives.

If the Zheng family's central command wasn't crushed and rendered unresponsive immediately, Zheng Zhilong could quite possibly transfer reinforcements from Jinjiang and other places by the second day. Zheng Zhilong's army was a private army, not as exhausted as government troops who only marched a dozen *li* a day; likely they could arrive at Anping to counterattack in about half a day.

Based on historical records of Zheng Zhilong's multiple uses of troops on land, the Intelligence Bureau and Grand Library believed his mobile land force in this period was around two thousand men. Adding personnel that could be mobilized from those staying behind, he could at most send three thousand men to Anping.

"We don't need to worry about Zheng Zhilong's reaction speed." Dongmen Chuiyu was full of confidence. "The Zheng family's army, whether in the Zheng Zhilong era or the Koxinga era, performed terribly against opponents with any combat capability. Both combat ability and will to fight are questionable. According to war games, sending out one infantry company equipped with machine guns and light artillery is enough to rout reinforcement troops." He cited an example: Qing general Ma Degong's surprise attack on Xiamen, where a few dozen mounted Qing scouts landed and caused the defense of the entire Xiamen island to collapse. Ma Degong easily seized Xiamen, the Zheng family's core base, with little naval support and no superiority in total troop strength.

"So Zheng Zhilong's subordinates are actually that incompetent in combat?"

"The Intelligence Bureau's view is that even by 17th-century standards, Zheng Zhilong's army—whether navy or army—is not a strong force." Dongmen Chuiyu said with certainty. "With the scale of troops we've mobilized, it's sufficient to complete all campaign tasks."

From this moment on, Zuooying Base was raised to the highest alert level, cancelling all leave and outings.

At 5:00 AM on September 27th, Ming Qiu received a telegram from the Navy Department in Lingao: "Commence operation." Ming Qiu summoned all captains of the First Fleet at the base and ordered: "The Senate has decided to declare war on Zheng Zhilong. This fleet will proceed immediately to Kinmen to strike Zheng Zhilong's fleet and provide cover for Army units landing in the Kinmen-Xiamen area." After speaking, he issued mission orders to each squadron commander and captain.

The main force of the First Fleet was the cruiser *Lichun* and four hybrid-powered first-class gunboats, plus five squadrons of sail-powered special service boats. Total warship tonnage exceeded 8,000 tons, carrying 200 cannons of various calibers. The hybrid-powered warships were all equipped with rifled guns. Although the proportion wasn't high, their range and power were beyond the reach of the smoothbore guns on the special service boats.

Due to the limited distance of this operation, accompanying ships carried no colliers. Army, Marine, logistics detachments, and supplies were transported by the 35 large miscellaneous transport ships of the Second Transport Group—H800s were not suitable for use in ports without port infrastructure due to their deep draft.

Another four squadrons of patrol boats coordinated with the operation, undertaking miscellaneous tasks.

During the crossing, every warship in the fleet was seizing time for targeted training. Especially squadron commanders and captains, who were hurriedly familiarizing themselves with the hydrological data of Xiamen Bay and Weitou Bay and intelligence on Zheng family defenses that had just been issued before departure.

That evening, the fleet arrived at Penghu. The sea was calm during the crossing; all fishing boats encountered en route were detained and escorted to Penghu.

The fleet dropped anchor at Penghu. Joint Logistics personnel established a temporary base on Magong Island, setting up supply dumps and aid stations. Army personnel went ashore for a brief rest.

Although the Navy didn't issue orders for rest, the number of personnel on watch per shift was reduced by half, allowing all personnel to rest in rotation to build up strength for the attack two days later.

Li Huamei stood on the deck of the *Lichun*—the sun had set. The First Fleet implemented a blackout; except for a few necessary signal lights, all lights were extinguished. The camp on shore was also dark and silent.

However, these days were during the full moon. Even without lights, the anchored ships among the islands and the continuous tents on Magong Island could be seen under the moonlight.

Though men and ships were many, no clamor was heard anywhere. Ships were anchored in order; no one walked about randomly on the island or decks. A scene of solemn discipline. Signal lights on ships and in the camp blinked in sequence, transmitting messages she didn't yet understand. Faintly, sounds of passwords carried by the sea breeze could be heard. All this filled Li Huamei, participating in a large-scale Australian operation for the first time, with secret awe—herself, the young miss, the Ming court, Chinese and foreign maritime merchants, all seemed too tiny and insignificant before such power.

She was on watch. Since *Hangzhou* was undergoing modification, it didn't participate in this operation, but as a member of the probationary officers, she boarded the cruiser *Lichun*—accidentally achieving the primary task the young miss had assigned her.

This was her first time serving on a ship as a crew member rather than a captain in many years. Based on her expertise, Li Huamei was assigned to the Sail and Rigging Department as a probationer.

Boarding this black "giant ship," Li Huamei's excitement was beyond measure—just like the feeling when she first boarded the Holy Ship, perhaps even more excited. The Holy Ship didn't move, after all, and was too far beyond her level of understanding. Unlike the *Lichun*, which, though having many incredible aspects, was within her scope of comprehension. While sailing, she had seen European heavy ships of similar size—some even larger than the *Lichun*. Three huge masts, cloud-like sails, and intricate rigging were once her capital for mocking the "Senate Navy."

Assigned to the Sail and Rigging Department this time, she had wanted to properly show off her skills in front of the group. Leaving aside the Senators, even the naval officers and men they recruited, though mostly from maritime backgrounds, were laymen at climbing masts and handling sails. However, she was soon disappointed. The furling and unfurling of *Lichun's* sails was all done by a method she couldn't quite understand: the sailor in charge pulled a lever under the mast, and the nearby rope winch would whir and rotate on its own, raising or lowering the sails, completing the operation instantly. Compared to the *Hangzhou*, where raising sails required sailors to line up chanting shanties while pulling ropes and turning capstans, it was heaven and earth: if it were a competition, the *Hangzhou's* sailors wouldn't even have assembled before the sail raising here was finished.

Mysterious "automation" like this could be seen in many places on the *Lichun*: weighing anchor, rotating cannons... as long as it was labor-intensive work on the ship, moving some lever or turning a wheel would make the object mysteriously move on its own. Li Huamei roughly knew this was the same mysterious power of water and fire as the fire-wheel carts and big iron cranes the Australians operated on shore—the huge black funnel amidships among the three masts, belching thick smoke and white steam, was the embodiment of this power.

She developed a keen interest in this "water-fire power," but the engine department controlled it, and it had nothing to do with her. The Sail and Rigging Department worked on deck, and aside from encountering those pitch-black figures when returning to quarters to rest, she never saw the engine crew.

"It would be great if I could sneak into the engine department to take a look sometime," Li Huamei thought secretly. She realized how ridiculous her initial desire to get an Australian "fast ship" was; just relying on herself and her Chinese and foreign sailors, they couldn't serve this big black ship at all.

To get this kind of ship, the Australians would have to help train the entire crew—relying on her and the young miss's power alone was simply wishful thinking.

She sighed. Now, even if she got an Australian pure sailing fast ship—like the *Haitian*—she'd be satisfied. She wondered what her *Hangzhou* would become after modification?

Thinking of this, she involuntarily thought of the young miss, her sister, and herself—and Elder Qi. She felt she had always been involuntary, pushed by some force, walking step by step to this point.

At this moment, she stood on the deck of the Australian "black ship," wearing their uniform, yet still harboring disloyalty. What would be her destiny? She felt thinking this way was very unlucky, yet couldn't help letting her thoughts wander.

Li Huamei stood alone in the darkness for a long time until the relief watch arrived. She handed over her shift and returned to the cabin below deck.

As a probationary reserve officer, she wasn't qualified for an officer's cabin and slept in the petty officers' large berthing compartment: all hammocks.

Sleeping in a common compartment with a bunch of men made Li Huamei very uncomfortable. Although everyone knew she was a famous pirate and no one dared try anything, just watching these men undress for sleep every day made her feel uncomfortable all over. And the men also expressed that this was too stimulating and awkward. Finally, the ship's administration partitioned off a small corner of the berthing compartment with wooden boards for her.

Li Huamei returned to her "private room," took off her coat, and climbed into the hammock. The snoring in the outer compartment was already loud. Still unaccustomed to such an environment, she could only close her eyes to rest her mind. In one more day, the fleet would set sail for Anping.
