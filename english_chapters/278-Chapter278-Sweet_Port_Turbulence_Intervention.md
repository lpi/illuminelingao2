# Chapter 278: Sweet Port Turbulence – Intervention

"Good. I'll have them build a dedicated compound for you inside the sugar factory."

"No," Bei Wei declined. "Too conspicuous. We won't be staying here long."

"Alright then. Qiwei has inns in both Haikang and Xuwen counties. You can rest and resupply there. You can also stay at any of the South China Sugar Factory's properties, though conditions are basic. I'll send someone to inform them right away."

"Don't bother. We'll stay at inns along the way. We'll try to avoid any connection to the South China Sugar Factory."

"Do we have any assignments?" Chang Shide was quite excited.

"None," Bei Wei replied bluntly.

Chen Tianxiong said: "The sugar factory has no specific assignments. You just need to cooperate with our operations. I'll handle the specific matters. But in my daily life, I'm still the sugar factory's technician."

The absence of specific intelligence duties pleased Wen Tong; he had no interest in such matters. There was still a huge pile of sugar factory matters to deal with.

"The Tripitaka Plan is a long-term operation. For the next several years, we'll be in the preparatory phase," Chen Tianxiong said. "What's our relationship with the local government like?"

"Relations are decent, but we're not close," Wen Tong described their recent dealings with the *yamen*, including matters related to the sugar factory reforms and maintaining order. "...Overall, we haven't had much contact."

"I think that's about to change." Chen Tianxiong said with a smile. "Right now, even the blind could see you've struck it rich. There'll be no shortage of trouble from now on."

"Yes, I've been worried about that too," Wen Tong said with concern. "Although the Qiwei Escort Agency has laid some groundwork for us, their own roots here are quite shallow. Some things they probably can't handle."

"If worst comes to worst, we'll just pay for peace," Chang Shide said. "How about giving the officials some 'dry shares'? A protection umbrella. Besides, in two years Leizhou will be ours anyway."

"Try to bring local officials into the fold. Form a common interest group." This was the Executive Committee's instruction to all transmigrators operating in Ming-controlled territory.

"That works," Wen Tong nodded. "But we'll need to report the specifics to the Executive Committee. Speaking of which, it's really inconvenient here without even a radio. Even the salt field village, a place like that, has a 5W radio."

"The Executive Committee will probably allocate one to you soon. Mass production of radios is about to make progress. The glass factory has been experimenting with pulling glass tubes every day, and Dr. Zhong has already started work on it," Chen Tianxiong said.

"Making radios?" Wen Tong was skeptical. "That's pretty high-tech, isn't it?"

"He's got lots of high-tech things he wants to make: clocks, batteries, and hydrogen airships. I don't think the airship is very realistic, but just let him talk."

"I've debated him about that airship idea before. It's completely impractical. Dr. Zhong reads too many books; he's gotten a bit theoretical." Chang Shide was dismissive.

"If he can make things, tell him to first give us a vacuum pan, and a centrifuge too." All Wen Tong could think about was his sugar.

"That's probably not difficult for him either. Oh, by the way, I heard we were coming, and he asked me to pass on a message: Xuwen is extremely rich in diatomaceous earth, even more than Lingao. It can be used for filtering to make white sugar."

"Really? Then I'll have to send people to look for it properly. The current yellow clay water method is terribly inefficient." Wen Tong perked up at this. "At this rate, the labor cost per ton of white sugar is just too high."

The price of raw brown sugar was much lower than white sugar. Processing it into white sugar before selling would yield far greater profits. Wen Tong had been racking his brains lately, wondering if he could come up with a white sugar process that was within their capabilities but more efficient. The raw brown sugar in the warehouse was piling up. Before the steel rollers, the average yield per *mu* of cane field was a little over three *shi* of raw brown sugar. Now, with the improved extraction rate, each *mu* yielded over five *shi*. The sugarcane fields under the South China Factory's name alone could produce 13,000 *shi* of raw brown sugar. Add in the processing fees earned from toll processing, and raw brown sugar was piling up like a mountain in the warehouse—a total of over 20,000 *shi*. Meanwhile, the white sugar workshop, running two shifts around the clock, could only produce five or six *shi* a day.

Just as they were talking, Wen Xiu suddenly came to report: a pigeon from Guangzhou had arrived with a secret letter.

Chang Shide had him leave, then fetched a codebook from inside the room and began decoding. Everyone watched eagerly. After a few minutes, Chang Shide said happily: "Zhang Xin's letter says to ship out the stored sugar as quickly as possible. They want raw brown sugar too. The market is quite good: the Guangzhou price is three *liang* eight *qian*—looks like it will go even higher! He says if we can purchase more, buy as much as possible. Ship it to Guangzhou and it turns into silver!"

"Wonderful," Wen Tong was in high spirits. "Liao Dahua told me the purchase price on Hai'an Street is only two *liang* five *qian*!"

Chang Shide said: "Then let's buy at three *liang*!" Everyone burst into laughter. The feeling of making a windfall profit was quite fine.

Wen Tong said with a smile: "If he hadn't written, I was about to write asking what to do with all this sugar. Several sugar trading houses here have approached us wanting to buy our sugar. I hesitated and didn't agree to sell. Good thing I didn't—otherwise we'd have taken a huge loss!"

Chang Shide said: "In that case, we should go buy from them!"

"Forget that idea. They know the Guangzhou market at least as well as we do. Hmph!" Wen Tong apparently didn't have a high opinion of these sugar houses.

"Who cares? From now on, this will be our territory anyway." Chang Shide said, then opened the door and called Wen Xiu. "Go invite Manager Liao here."

This past month they had been trying to find a local manager familiar with sugar trading operations to handle the sugar factory's external dealings. They'd specifically asked Liao Dahua to accompany them to Hai'an Street and the county seat to see if there were any managers willing to switch jobs. But they'd come up empty. No one wanted to jump ship, and more people were puzzled: you're a sugar mill, why do you need a sugar trading house manager?

As a result, Liao Dahua became their only local agent. For convenience, Liao Dahua simply moved into the South China Factory compound. Fortunately, it was only two or three *li* from the county seat; if something came up at the escort branch, he could get back in no time.

Liao Dahua came to the study. Bei Wei, not wanting to appear too much, had withdrawn to the side room. Wen Tong told Liao Dahua about the plan to do large-scale sugar purchasing and asked him to put together a team—even without a real sugar trading house manager, they intended to do this themselves.

Liao Dahua shook his head repeatedly: "Sir, this is inadvisable."

"What's inadvisable about it?"

"Sir, you may not know," Liao Dahua said. "The sugar from Leizhou has always been purchased by the trading houses on Hai'an Street..."

"They buy theirs, we buy ours. Nothing to do with each other." Wen Tong was puzzled.

But Chang Shide understood: "It's a monopoly, right?"

"Exactly," Liao Dahua said. There were twenty-one sugar trading houses on Hai'an Street, forming a trade guild called "Haiyi Hall." Any sugar produced in Leizhou that was to be exported had to go through their hands. Each year's purchase price was publicly discussed by the guild before trading began. Outsiders who hadn't joined Haiyi Hall couldn't enter the sugar purchasing business.

"I see." Wen Tong nodded. These monopoly organizations really were everywhere.

"Strange. Why can't we enter? Says who?" Chang Shide wasn't convinced.

"Well..." Liao Dahua hadn't really thought about why not. The sugar houses on Hai'an Street had monopolized Leizhou's sugar exports for decades—everyone viewed it as the normal state of affairs. "The shopkeepers may not know, but the cane farmers don't have large ships, so it's inconvenient for them to ship their own product. They've always entrusted the sugar houses to ship their raw sugar to other regions for sale on their behalf. After selling, the sugar houses would settle accounts with the farmers. Traditionally, the houses took two percent as commission, settling at ninety-eight percent. Over time, due to the risk of loss at sea from storms and pirates, and occasional instances of houses absconding with payments, it gradually became the current system of cash purchases. The houses make more profit, but the farmers are willing too—after all, the houses take the greater risk."

"I see. That's not so different from us." Wen Tong said. "We can take these risks too. Tomorrow we'll start preparing. In a few days we'll open for purchasing!"

Liao Dahua's lips moved, as if he wanted to say more. Chang Shide laughed: "It's just a little business. What's the big deal? Look, we'll give Qiwei Escort two percent of whatever we purchase."

Two percent was no small figure. This would greatly benefit the escort agency, and he could personally get a nice cut too. Thinking of the vast wealth of these Australian merchants, Liao Dahua's courage swelled. He replied: "Since the shopkeepers have made up their minds, this humble one will go arrange it. I know a bit about the sugar trading business. I'll go prepare right away!" With that, he took his leave.

But Chen Tianxiong said: "Isn't this a bit risky? Have you considered what happens if the other side strikes back?"

"It's fine," Wen Tong said. "I've been to Hai'an Street and met several managers. They're all legitimate businesses. In fact, the entire Hai'an Street is basically managed by them. Good order, everything running smoothly."

Chen Tianxiong shook his head: "Old Wen, I'm not trying to meddle—this is your domain—but you should know: interest groups will stop at nothing to protect their interests. Not selling sugar to the houses and shipping it out ourselves already steps on their toes. Now we're also purchasing—the conflict of interest is practically life-or-death."

"Is it really that extreme?" Wen Tong was skeptical.

"And you've been around the block. Do you really think the 17th century was all simple folk, with nobody picking up lost items on the road or locking doors at night? Every ugly aspect of society—which one of them hasn't existed since ancient times? Merchants pursue profit. I don't need to recite Marx's assessment of capitalists to you, do I?"

"Tell me what you think we should do." Wen Tong thought his points had some merit. The notion that ancient people were simple was something he'd learned wasn't necessarily true during his time in this era. People of this era were the same as modern people: some good, some bad, and mostly ordinary folks who kept their heads down—neither particularly good nor particularly bad.

Bei Wei rarely spoke up: "Chen Tianxiong's point should be considered. What if the other side retaliates?"

"Before we've fully developed, it's best not to touch that piece of cake," Chen Tianxiong advised.

"I don't think we need to be this nervous." After much consideration, Chang Shide said, "The sugar houses on Hai'an Street are just ordinary merchants. How much trouble can they make? At worst, they have better connections with the county and prefectural *yamens*. We have contacts in Guangzhou now, and we're on speaking terms with the Leizhou prefectural *yamen* and the Haikang and Xuwen county *yamens*. What can they do to us?"

After some discussion, Chen Tianxiong saw their minds were made up. As he wasn't part of the South China Factory's decision-making circle, saying more would seem like overstepping—not good for future work. So he stopped pressing his view and only reminded them to be prepared for contingencies. Bei Wei had no interest in any of this and hadn't spoken. Bored, he gazed at the ever-growing mound of bagasse piling up outside the courtyard wall. Suddenly he asked:

"What about the by-products from sugar-making?"

"There are many uses, but we need equipment to utilize them. Speaking of which, I'd like to report this to the Executive Committee too. We'll need some fermentation equipment and bacterial cultures." Wen Tong explained the recovery and utilization of sugarcane byproducts: strictly speaking, there was no waste in the sugar production process—even wastewater could be used to produce things.

Diluting molasses and inoculating it with different bacterial cultures could produce alcohol, glycerol, acetone, butanol, citric acid, and yeast. Bagasse could be used for papermaking and producing furfural. The filter mud from the sedimentation and filtration process could yield sugarcane wax, with the remainder usable as fertilizer. As for the cane leaves cleaned off the sugarcane itself, they could be used as animal feed. The cane tops and cane butts, which had low sugar content and were cut off before entering the press, could still be used for brewing spirits or extracting alcohol.

"This is actually relatively simple recovery and utilization. Bagasse can also be used to recover aconitic acid," Wen Tong said. "How much we can utilize depends on how many bacterial cultures and chemicals we have available, and we need the right equipment."

"Of the byproducts the South China Factory can use on-site, probably just making alcohol from molasses and making paper from bagasse?" Chang Shide said.

"Papermaking isn't realistic." Wen Tong had recently been investigating the boiler's fuel situation. "Using all the bagasse just for fuel is about right."

"What a waste..."

"Then we'll have to buy coal to fire the boiler. Honestly, I'd rather use coal. The moisture content of bagasse is too high. If labor weren't so cheap here, the manpower spent every day turning and drying the bagasse would be enough to bankrupt us." Wen Tong said. "Industrialization is great, but the consumption is equally heavy. I'm even wondering now if there'll be enough bagasse to last until the end of the crushing season."

Buying coal was certainly possible. The route to buy coal from Hongji in Vietnam wasn't far. And Gaozhou wasn't far from Leizhou either—there was a fairly large coal-mining district within Guangdong Province, the present-day Maoming mining area. However, this mining area had only scattered operations in the Ming Dynasty. As a supplementary fuel source, it wasn't a bad option. At least it was a much shorter route than shipping coal from Guangzhou.

"Then let's set up a coal depot." Chang Shide's mind worked quickly. "Few households here use coal—mostly they burn wood. Besides our own use, we might be able to do some business with the coal we import."

"Sure, it won't cost much. Leave it to Qiwei to handle."
