# Chapter 346 - Sweet Potato

reciprocate favors; Shi Niaoren wanted to do something to express his gratitude. No, not just to the Chemical Department, but also to the Industrial and Energy Committee, the Agricultural Committee, the Army and Navy, the Civil Affairs Committee...

Counting on his fingers, it seemed there were too many departments and people to express gratitude to, and it was inconvenient to favor one over another. The best way seemed to be to send a token of friendship to the transmigrators in all these places.

This was relatively difficult. The Ministry of Health did the work of healing the wounded and rescuing the dying. Generally speaking, people from the Ministry of Health enjoyed unparalleled expert treatment in the Transmigration Group. Everyone was very polite wherever they went, and whenever demands were raised, they were satisfied as much as possible—the reason was none other than that in this space-time, medical care was the scarcest resource. No one dared to say they would be forever healthy, never get sick, and survive without injury until they became one of the heads of the five hundred powerful families.

This was a mixture of fear and respect. Shi Niaoren disapproved of this kind of respect triggered by "fearing I might need his help later and fall into his hands."

The Ministry of Health was too highly honored now. From the standpoint of long-term peace and stability, they should do some things to win more goodwill from everyone.

Shi Niaoren's gaze fell on the road outside the window. The early summer sun was shining brightly, and the roadside trees just planted not long ago were all wilting. People walking by, whether transmigrators or indigenous workers, all wore straw hats and were sweating like rain.

"Mm, heatstroke prevention and cooling." Shi Niaoren immediately thought of this. Liu San said he wanted to mix a few traditional Chinese medicines to make Zhuge Marching Powder, Ten Drops Water, and Huoxiang Zhengqi Water. The medicinal material sources for these three things were easy; they could be gathered by purchasing from local pharmacies and planting by themselves. The auxiliary material was just ethanol. Yet they were very effective against common summer ailments.

But making medicine took time. Just Liu San and his apprentice would find it a bit difficult to compound enough agents. Workers in the pharmaceutical factory were not like ordinary workers; not only did they need a strong sense of responsibility, but it was also best if they understood some pharmacy. Expansion was not something that could be done instantly.

"Mm, salt water!" Shi Niaoren suddenly thought, "Salt soda water!"

Salt soda water was a labor protection supply and the best beverage for manual laborers in summer. It not only prevented heatstroke and cooled down but also helped maintain electrolyte balance in the body and avoid dehydration.

But Shi Niaoren immediately realized he didn't have baking soda. Not only did he not have it, but the Chemical Department didn't have it either. Baking soda wasn't a rare item, but there had to be soda ash first. If the Soda Ash Plant didn't start work for a day, there would be no baking soda available for a day. So after thinking about this idea, he had to give it up first.

Unable to make soda water, might as well make physiological saline first. Thinking of this, Shi Niaoren decided to visit the pharmaceutical factory. He was waiting for He Ping to arrange some administrative affairs and the barefoot doctor training class—this was the nickname they privately gave to the first doctor training class. Through network recruitment, the Ministry of Health found four or five transmigrators who vainly attempted to escape labor and satisfy special hobbies by studying medicine.

However, after waiting and waiting, He Ping didn't come. Just as he was waiting anxiously, a glasses-wearing man walking with legs apart arrived, with a number "007" impressively on his chest. Shi Niaoren looked closely; it turned out to be Dugu Qiuhun, the Director of East Gate Market Police Station.

"Doctor, examine me please... here." Director Dugu quietly pointed to a certain part with his hand.

Shi Niaoren inquired carefully, then lifted the clothes to look at the physical signs, and knew the score in his heart.

"Chlamydia infection, nothing big." Shi Niaoren spoke relatively implicitly.

"What is Chlamydia, inflammation?"

"This..." Shi Niaoren thought for a moment, "No big problem, infection, infection." saying this he wrote a prescription, "Take the prescription to the pharmacy to get medicine from Hippo, tell Sister Li to give you an injection, and you'll be able to reassert your masculinity in two or three days." Shi Niaoren comforted him, then casually took out a small cardboard box from the desk and gave it to him, "Pay attention to safe entry and exit."

Dugu Qiuhun was startled: "Yes—!"

"It doesn't matter; it's not some severe ailment." Shi Niaoren smiled and said, "Better contact indigenous women less in the future."

"Understood! This won't be a problem, right!"

"Really no problem. Pay more attention to your body and take injections on time." Shi Niaoren comforted him for a while, and urged him again before sending him out the door.

"If not for Erythromycin, your trouble would be big!" Shi Niaoren muttered behind his back. He knew quite a few people hooked up with indigenous women recently. Originally, the Executive Committee thought the Ming Dynasty was a society of feudal ethical codes with a very closed social atmosphere; as long as everyone was restrained from whoring and raping, there wouldn't be gender issues. Now it seemed that the so-called feudal ethical codes were just so-so.

Now Shi Niaoren had no mind to wait for He Ping anymore. He left a note on his desk explaining several pending matters, then went to the farm.

Wu Nanhai was not in the office. According to his office secretary Chu Qing: "Master is at the Grain Processing Plant, processing sweet potatoes."

"By the river?" Shi Niaoren had never been to that place, only hearing there was a mill there processing rice for locals.

"Just go out from here, walk towards the south..." Chu Qing's Mandarin was a typical "Guang-Pu" (Cantonese-accented Mandarin) of this space-time, sounding deeply influenced by Wu Nanhai—Shi Niaoren knew that not only her, but even the head long-term worker Wang Tian here also had such an accent.

Since Wu Nanhai's Agricultural Committee moved to Bairen City and opened up the farm, sweet potatoes were the first batch of crops planted.

As a crop with high and stable yields, sweet potato had characteristics of wide adaptability, strong stress resistance, drought tolerance, barrenness tolerance, and few pests and diseases. Besides serving as grain rations and feed, and manufacturing starch, even leaves could be utilized as high-quality green feed—almost no part was wasted. Planting in places with better water and fertilizer conditions, general yield per mu could reach 3000-5000 kilograms, with individual cases of 7500 kilograms per mu. Compared to hybrid rice which would fail after only being planted once, it was a more meaningful "Transmigration Artifact".

However, in this space-time, sweet potatoes were not quite qualified as "Artifacts". Sweet potatoes were not fresh things here. Since the Wanli era, they had been introduced from the Philippines to China. They were first planted in Guangdong. Qiongzhou, facing it across the sea, enjoyed proximity and also had cultivation. When transmigrators went to the countryside, they often saw sweet potatoes.

Before planting sweet potatoes, for the sake of prudence, Wu Nanhai once asked Wang Tian—who counted as an expert at farming—how was the situation of planting sweet potatoes in Lingao? Wang Tian said: This thing has been planted in Lingao for seven or eight years. The earliest seed potatoes were introduced from Qiongshan side. Not a few people plant it. The advantage is it's trouble-free; just plant and it's done. Harvest the tubers, good for humans to eat and for feeding pigs. The growth period is short too; Lingao can harvest twice a year. It is an excellent miscellaneous grain—just not durable for storage. The local climate is humid, and sweet potatoes rot easily. Growers here don't know various cellar storage methods for sweet potatoes either. Some tried slicing and drying them for storage, but they also mold easily in the rainy season.

"The harvest is plentiful, and doesn't cost manpower or fertilizer. At most, one mu can harvest a thousand jin. But this thing can't stand storage. Small households planting too much is useless. Only big and small grain households with many long-term workers and livestock plant more."

"Master Wu! Now there are so many long-term and short-term workers used in various villages in Bairen and Bopu, we could actually plant more sweet potatoes—giving long-term workers rice for every meal like this is a bit of a loss. Actually, half rice and half dried sweet potato shreds, giving half a bowl more in quantity, plus some salted vegetables and salted fish, is already heavy labor food. Saves grain very much." Wang Tian enthusiastically put forward suggestions. Then he presented the tricks he learned to save money for the master when he was a "head worker" for landlords to Wu Nanhai one by one like treasures.

A complex expression flashed across Wu Nanhai's face. From a good side, this showed Wang Tian meant to "serve the master loyally"; from a bad side, Wang Tian's behavior was no different from a "traitor". Wu Nanhai used to hear people say: Foreigners coming to China were originally honest, all led astray by a group of fawning "traitors". Although biased, it was not unreasonable.

"This, discuss later, discuss later." Wu Nanhai couldn't harden his heart.

Seeing Wu Nanhai's face uncertain, Wang Tian didn't know where he spoke wrong, and shut his mouth.

Wu Nanhai thought for a moment and asked: "You said one mu can only harvest a thousand jin?" He didn't believe it. He knew when interning in the countryside that farmers could harvest two or three thousand jin per mu just by planting casually.

Wang Tian said: "Only the first year can harvest more than two thousand jin, then fewer year by year. Little enough to be only eight or nine hundred jin."

"Impossible..."

Fa Shilu nodded and reminded him: "Virus infection."

"Right, right, I actually forgot." Wu Nanhai looked ashamed. This was very basic knowledge, and he actually forgot it cleanly.

Sweet potatoes, also including tuber crops like potatoes, adopted asexual reproduction for a long time and would be infected by multiple viruses during growth and storage processes. Viruses would continuously accumulate in tuber pieces or seedlings, causing serious degradation of species nature, deteriorating quality, and significantly dropping yield. The reduction range was over 30% to 70%.

During the autumn harvest season of 1957, Hongtong County in Shanxi produced the national "High Yield Record" for sweet potatoes at that time: Mamuxiang Fenming Agricultural Cooperative's sweet potato yield per mu was 5510 jin.

Sweet potato yield of five thousand jin per mu was no longer a rare thing in the 21st century—new varieties of high-yield virus-free sweet potatoes, if planted carefully, would not have a yield lower than ten thousand jin in the first year. But in 1957 it was already number one in the country—this number one still had more or less some water (exaggeration). Without professional technical support, sweet potato yield was not ridiculously high.

To date, there were no high virus-resistant sweet potato varieties in agriculture, nor specific medicines to prevent and control viruses. Only by adopting virus-free technology could virus diseases be prevented and controlled, and sweet potato yield and quality improved.

Modern farmers didn't need to save seeds and breed seeds themselves; it was all handled by professional seed companies. When Wu Nanhai went to the countryside for an internship, what he saw, planted, and talked about were all virus-free sweet potato seedlings. He only needed to consider what kind of soil and climate matched which kind of seedling, naturally not thinking of this layer.

Even specially virus-stripped sweet potatoes would be re-infected and degrade after planting for three or four years. How to remove the virus was a specialized high technology. Fa Shilu had considered multiple plans on how to solve this problem in this space-time. He even brought a set of laboratory equipment specially used for virus removal.

The transmigrators' first batch of high-yield virus-free sweet potatoes was planted in December 1628. Generally, in areas with four distinct seasons, sweet potatoes started seedling nursing in February, transplanting in April, and harvesting in August. Lingao had the advantage that the temperature was above 18 degrees all year round, allowing planting in all four seasons. To ensure seedlings didn't leak out, key members of the Agricultural Committee like Fa Shilu and Wu Nanhai planted them personally, not using a single indigenous worker. Under careful maintenance and management, they welcomed the harvest at the end of April this year. The ten mu of sweet potatoes under experimental planting obtained a good result of 4000 kilograms per mu—because of the lack of chemical fertilizer, this harvest was far from bringing out the variety's advantage. To harvest sweet potatoes, they had to mobilize Army and Navy soldiers and students to help.

The farm's sweet potato bumper harvest, harvesting over 8000 jin per mu—this yield not only shocked Wang Tian but also surprised all employees in the farm. The news spread quickly, and many people wanted to come and see what Australian sweet potatoes looked like. Wu Nanhai asked Army soldiers helping with the harvest to guard the perimeter, forbidding any outsiders from entering the farm's fields until sweet potatoes were completely harvested.

Eighty thousand jin of sweet potatoes was not too much even by ancient standards. Rural areas often adopted cellar storage to store them and use them slowly. But after April and May in Lingao, the weather would immediately enter the rainy season, and cellar storage had certain risks of mold and rot. Moreover, various industries of the Transmigration Group had very urgent demands for the main product of sweet potatoes: starch. Finally, Wu Nanhai decided that except for a part reserved for seed promotion, all the rest would be transported to the grain processing plant to be processed into finished products.

Sweet potatoes could produce many products: vermicelli, glass noodles, maltose, glucose, dextrin, yellow wine, alcohol, soy sauce... Actually, changes didn't depart from the origin; mainly starch derivative products. Therefore, Wu Nanhai determined sweet potato processing would focus on manufacturing starch, utilizing waste residue and waste materials generated during starch making to take care of manufacturing certain by-products.

The Ministry of Light Industry also had great interest in the harvest of large batches of sweet potatoes. Mo Xiaoan came to report every day, constantly putting forward his own views on what new things to produce. Unexpectedly, his most eager product was not things that looked "very modern" like glucose, dextrin, instant rice noodles, etc., but dried sweet potatoes—precisely speaking, Liancheng Red Heart Dried Sweet Potato Strips—one of the famous Eight Dried Foods of Fujian.

"This thing sells very well." When Shi Niaoren ran to the bamboo shed known as the food factory, he saw Mo Xiaoan expounding: "It was an export material back then. Even now, dried sweet potato strips are also very popular snacks. In this space-time, sweet potatoes are still rare things; we can totally take the high-end route..."

"I think this is suspenseful—" Wu Nanhai didn't look favorably on the dried sweet potato plan, "Locals in this space-time rarely eat snacks; only some wealthy and leisurely people eat them."

"If there is no market in Lingao locally, we can export to Guangzhou."
