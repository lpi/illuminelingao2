# Chapter 1732: Surging Waves

If she could really provide clues, it would indeed be a great merit for the Chief. It was just that the matter was too incredible, and Guo Xi'er couldn't help but feel a bit suspicious. She remembered that during the training, the Senator who taught safety classes had said to guard against natives using certain excuses to approach the Chiefs and waiting for an opportunity to assassinate them.

Seemingly seeing through Guo Xi'er's thoughts, the young lady of the Dong family said: "Don't be afraid, Miss. This servant is not someone willing to risk her life to be an assassin. If I were willing to die, I would have hanged myself earlier. Since I didn't want to die then, I won't die now. If you are still worried, Miss can send a few capable maids to search this servant thoroughly."

Guo Xi'er thought to herself that this woman talked big. She didn't look like an ordinary official's daughter. So she said: "Miss Dong, the Chief is busy talking to someone right now. I will report to him when he is free."

The young girl curtsied again and said: "Thank you, Miss... You have a bodhisattva's heart... This servant is called Dong Mingdang. You can just call me Mingdang from now on."

Liu Xiang talked with Lü Yizhong for more than an hour, and only then did Lü Yizhong leave satisfied—regardless of whether the Senate would adopt his suggestions, their attitude towards him was quite reliant. Under the rule of the Senate of the Great Song, his future would not be too bad.

Liu Xiang was much more conflicted. The gentry and old intellectuals were an important issue they had to face. Although the Senate was quite loose in its overall authorization—whether it was him or Wen Desi, they had almost full power in local administrative leadership—this did not mean he could act completely according to his own ideas. If something went wrong, it would really be a case of the higher you climb, the harder you fall.

After sending Lü Yizhong away, Liu Xiang felt a bit muddled, so he came out for a walk. The courtyard was already bustling with activity. National Army soldiers were cleaning up sanitation, and piles of rubbish and garbage were cleared out from various places; Planning Institute staff were checking and registering "useless" furniture and furnishings one by one, moving them to the treasury for temporary storage; sanitation personnel carried large buckets of disinfectant, and several naturalized citizen employees tore open packaging paper and hung wooden signs with black characters on a white background at the door of each room. Others were moving furniture like office desks, chairs, and bunk beds in from outside. The originally solemn and almost suffocating Prefectural Yamen was now like a beehive, bustling and full of vitality and life.

Directing this chaos was Wang Sangou, the Chief of General Affairs of the City Office. He was wearing a naturalized citizen uniform that was so new it looked blue. He was already over sixty this year. In the 17th century, this could be considered a long life. After emigrating from Baitu Village, he changed his name: changing "Gou" (Dog) to "Gou" (Careless/Surname), and was arranged to do odd jobs in the General Office—he was born a slave and had deep hatred; he had been a bachelor all his life, with no children and no ties. He was exactly the kind of person the General Office felt was reliable.

After working in general affairs at the General Office for many years, Wang Sangou had always been single-minded and diligent. Compared to the days in Baitu Village as a slave to the Lin family, the General Office was heaven. He had no other thoughts; the General Office was his home. The more he worked, the more energetic he became, and the younger he felt. Originally an illiterate person, he even passed the Class C diploma exam. This Guangdong Strategy required a large number of cadres. Although Wang Sangou was a bit old, he was still promoted to Deputy Chief of the General Affairs Section in the Guangzhou Municipal Government, specifically responsible for general affairs. At this moment, he was beaming with joy, shouting and waving his hands. Seeing Liu Xiang coming out, he hurriedly went up to him and said: "Chief, I've been waiting for you for a long time!"

Liu Xiang was stunned: "What for?"

"Hanging the sign!" Wang Sangou said happily, "Our Great Song Senate has recovered Guangzhou. There must be some etiquette when hanging up this sign."

Liu Xiang thought, is there an unveiling ceremony? Just as he was thinking, he was already surrounded by Wang Sangou and others and brought to the Great Eight Characters Wall of the Prefectural Yamen. Many people had already gathered outside the yamen gate. Theoretically, the National Army and naturalized citizen cadres were all beaming. Outside the cordon, Guangzhou citizens gathered in clouds. The fear brought by the overnight change of regime had vanished under the calm and peaceful takeover. Now, they were anxious to see what these "long-renowned" "Australians" and "Hair-shorn Thieves" actually looked like.

Speaking of live Australians in the city, everyone only knew that Shopkeeper Guo was one, but Shopkeeper Guo looked no different from the wealthy merchants and big households of Great Ming. When Guangzhou was besieged, bold people sneaked up the city wall and looked at the "Great Song Navy" under the city, only seeing many soldiers in gray and blue clothes. They hadn't seen a single serious "Real Hair-shorn."

Seeing a man surrounded by people coming out of the main gate, it looked like he was probably a Real Hair-shorn. He was only in his thirties, with dark skin and a capable physique. He wore only a thick short jacket with buttons down the front. The style was no different from the surrounding "Fake Hair-shorn," but the material was stiffer. The crowd couldn't help but be disappointed—the uniform of this Great Song was really shabby enough.

How could Liu Xiang know the twists and turns in the bellies of the onlookers? Wang Sangou asked him to say a few words. Liu Xiang hadn't prepared, but someone dragged over a packing crate, and he stood on it, scanned the people in front of the gate, and said loudly: "Comrades, citizens of Guangzhou! Today is the day our Senate's Guangzhou Special City Military Control Commission is established. From today on, Guangzhou, this city famous for a thousand years, has returned to the hands of my Great Song and my Senate! We will work together to rebuild a prosperous, hygienic, and civilized New Guangzhou here, and use this as a starting point to rebuild the Divine Land!"

As soon as his voice fell, Wang Sangou lit a string of ten-thousand-count firecrackers. Amid the crackling sound of firecrackers, two naturalized citizens hung the wooden sign with "Guangzhou Special City Municipal Government" in black characters on a white background at the main gate. The naturalized citizens and National Army soldiers clapped their hands together, especially those naturalized citizens from Lingao, who were extremely excited. Wang Sangou was so happy he didn't know what to say. He remembered that he had drifted all his life, without a wife or children, a lonely person. Only in his twilight years was he taken in by the Senate, and from then on he experienced the taste of being a human. At this moment, seeing the Senator standing in front of the Guangzhou Prefectural Yamen and hanging up the sign, he burst into tears of excitement and couldn't help raising his arms and shouting: "Long live the Senate!"

Following his shout, the naturalized citizens and soldiers shouted together: "Long live the Senate!" Countless rifles with fixed bayonets were raised high like a forest.

The shouts of "Long live" were like a tide, spreading out wave after wave from the center of Guangzhou, beating against the entire city.

In a residence in the city, the shouts like mountains calling and seas roaring were also faintly heard. Several men who were feasting stopped their wine cups and listened intently to the blurred roar. The courtyard was silent, dead quiet.

The cheers and shouts took a long time to disappear into the air. A young man in his thirties sighed slightly: "I didn't expect this day to come! Gathering the iron of the Nine Provinces cannot cast a mistake like this!"

His voice was very painful. The people beside him couldn't help but feel sad.

Another person persuaded: "Young Master Liang doesn't need to blame himself. For the Hair-shorn thieves to have this day, from the lords in the court down to the officials in Guangdong, I'm afraid no one can absolve themselves of blame..."

The person who said "iron of the Nine Provinces" was Liang Cunhou. This young Juren from an aristocratic family had no intention of officialdom. Under the pretext of caring for his elderly parents, he traveled at home all year round, living a low-key, secretive, and luxurious life.

Liang Cunhou said: "That's what they say, but back when the Hair-shorn thieves first came to Guangzhou, I shouldn't have been bewildered by them and actually became their accomplice! Otherwise, how could they gain a foothold in Guangzhou! And how could they recruit so many refugees from this Guangzhou to gather into an army!"

The person persuading him was Lin Zunxiu. He said: "Young Master Liang, the Hair-shorn thieves had that old thief Gao Ju guiding them, and old thief Gao had Eunuch Yang as a backer. Even if you saw through their true colors, what use would it be? There are plenty of people in the world who forget justice for profit!"

Liang Cunhou remained silent, silently drinking the wine in his cup. It didn't taste like the Hundred Flowers Spring of Ram City, but like a cup of bitter wine.

Huang Bingkun, who was on the side, couldn't help but say at this moment: "The Hair-shorn thieves are not only best at deceiving the world and stealing fame, but also accustomed to confusing people's hearts and playing with the common people in the palm of their hands. I'm just afraid that it won't take long for this Guangzhou City to become like Lingao, no longer the King's land of the Great Ming!"

Liang Cunhou said: "The Hair-shorn thieves only entered Guangzhou City. I don't know about the other prefectures and counties..."

Lin Zunxiu shook his head and said: "How many troops can the prefectures and counties have? The Hair-shorn thieves entered the city from the Great East Gate, and the Mobile Training Camp outside the city had no reaction at all. Presumably, presumably..."

Everyone understood what he didn't say. Yesterday, not a single cannon shot was heard in all of Guangzhou, nor was there a single cry of killing. When they woke up, the flag on the city wall had already changed. Needless to say, these officers and soldiers had already surrendered to the Hair-shorn thieves.

"There isn't a single man among them!" Liang Cunhou shook his head painfully.

"The Hair-shorn thieves have been operating in Guangzhou for a long time. The Great World is built outside the Great East Gate, less than two quarters of an hour away from the East Pass厢! The lingering fear from their invasion of the Pearl River back then still remains. The officers and soldiers fear the sharp ships and cannons of the Hair-shorn thieves like tigers." Lin Zunxiu said, "Even if the officers and soldiers dared to fight, how many rounds could they last under their hands?"

Liang Cunhou fell into silence again. He realized that Lin Zunxiu was right. The fighting will of the officers and soldiers wouldn't actually change the outcome of Guangzhou's fall. In fact, it could be seen from the Pearl River Battle back then that Guangzhou was just a ripe fruit that time, and the Hair-shorn thieves could eat it whenever they wanted.

"I don't know if Viceroy Xiong has noticed anything," Huang Bingkun said. "We should try to notify him to prepare early."

"Viceroy Xiong likes pacification the most. To ask him to organize the army and prepare for war, I think it's difficult." Liang Cunhou was a bit worried.

"Zhaoqing is a strategic pass for the two provinces, with dangerous terrain. It has the geographical advantage of the Little Three Gorges. If preparations can be made early, the Hair-shorn thieves may not be able to break into Zhaoqing. If Zhaoqing is not lost, Western Guangdong can be preserved, and there will still be room for retrieving the situation in the future." Lin Zunxiu spoke with fervor and assurance, "There are still the troops of the Nan'ao Vice General available in Eastern Guangdong. When the soldiers are strong and provisions sufficient, they can echo each other from east and west to pinch the Hair-shorn thieves."

"I am untalented, but I am willing to go to Zhaoqing to warn Viceroy Xiong!" Huang Bingkun said resolutely.

It was meaningless for him to stay here. If he had to continue to compromise under the rule of the Hair-shorn thieves, he could just stay in Lingao. Why come here!
