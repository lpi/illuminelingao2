# Chapter 173: Lin Gonglao and Zhang Jiqi

Transporting people and materials: the previous Gou Manor experience was overland. This time, it was all sea transport to accumulate experience for future mass migrations.

"The Navy can send landing craft," Chen Haiyang said. "The *Dengyingzhou* handles the Guangzhou cargo—it can't be moved."

"How much can the *Fubo* carry?"

"About 70 to 80 people." Chen Haiyang sketched calculations. "Less than the *Dengyingzhou*—cannons and ammunition occupy tonnage."

"Six transport ships?"

"All small—each can carry 30 to 40 people." Chen Haiyang calculated. "We also captured the village's two 200-*liao* ships plus 5 or 6 small boats. All are usable—capacity is no problem."

"How long by sea?"

"With sailboats, generously estimated—two days."

"Provisions?"

"Grassland-5 works. The stuff is durable. Filling." Chen Haiyang obviously disliked hard rice cakes.

"Transporting people is no problem—one wave with the big ships can handle it. Common folk have few possessions. But timber, iron, hemp, and tung oil occupy tonnage."

Xi Yazhou said, "The Army should partially withdraw. Five platoons and three cannons deployed—home is somewhat empty."

Dongmen Chuiyu said, "Starting tomorrow—each departing ship takes one squad. Troop transport and escort combined. Leave one platoon until the new ship launches. Is Bopu prepared? 500+ people arriving suddenly!"

"Wu De has a plan. Housing is still being built. They'll first use the quarantine camp—it's currently empty."

"With the *Fubo* here—does it affect Bopu's defenses? The situation is tense," Wen Desi recalled.

"Four fishing trawlers are enough. They all have breech-loading cannons. High mobility, high speed, high firepower—anyone attacking commits suicide."

"Tomorrow—the first wave moves the entire Lin and Lu families." Wen Desi's lips curved slightly. "Leave Shipwright Zhang to continue building."

The next day, all of Baitu erupted. Adults shouting, children crying, women wailing. The transmigrators were prepared: determining who went first and who later, they distributed five-colored paper slips.

The beach had rope lanes with matching color flags. Slip holders followed the color to the correct ships—there was no confusion. Ships specially brought hundreds of strapped rattan baskets and rope for luggage.

"Can this old ticket still board your ship..." Li Haiping hummed on *Fubo's* stern castle, watching struggling streams of elderly with young, bundle-laden people shuffling under the soldiers' urging.

Lin Gonglao glanced at the humming "bald bandit." Strange tune—like their strange clothing. The clan elder called them "Chiefs," bowing obsequiously. He feared their firearms: that checkpoint stockade, including the purchased cannon, had cost the village hundreds of *liang*. The short-term workers stationed there were also expensive. Hundreds of local bandits couldn't touch it—yet they smashed it in minutes.

Now that he was captured, his future was unknown. Lin Gonglao was especially annoyed. He was a member of the Lin clan—the clan leader was his uncle. Born in Baitu, he had never suffered hardship, belonging to the village's "ruling class." Like the other second-generation Lin and Lu members, he had no interest in his ancestors' crafts and learned only the basics. He preferred martial arts—leading short-term workers in drilling, and dragging anyone annoying to the Shenming Pavilion for beatings. He strutted around like he owned the place.

Obviously, those days were over. Growing annoyed, he suddenly felt someone bump his back. Turning, he saw Wang Sangou—a fifty-something bachelor and clan-kept laborer—basically the Lin clan's communal slave.

Already irritated—and now struck by a slave—his back ached. Rage erupted: he raised his palm and slapped; raised his leg and kicked:

"Coffin scraper! Got no eyes?!"

Wang Sangou, loaded with bags, was shuffling along. The palm and kick sent him sprawling. Several young Lin clansmen saw his ridiculous pose and laughed. The older ones grimaced, quickly pulling away the laughing children.

This striking and cursing blocked the queue. Soldiers rushed over to clear the jam. Li Haiping saw everything clearly from the stern castle and shook his head. Such a tiny place, yet there are already petty tyrants.

"Who's that?" someone asked.

"The Lin clan apparently. I heard the kid's quite arrogant. Even after the clan elder surrendered, he was still resentful," Li Haiping said casually.

"Such a tough character?"

Lin Gonglao—after beating Wang Sangou—felt refreshed. He victoriously added more kicks. Just as he was getting enthusiastic, a burly man pushed through, carrying a cudgel.

"What's going on?!" The man bellowed. "Nothing better than fighting?!"

"I dare not." Wang Sangou scrambled up, begging. "No fighting—no fighting—"

Lin Gonglao was still young and hot-blooded. He hadn't adjusted to his changed status and arrogantly faced him:

"I'm beating my slave—what's it to—"

Mid-sentence—*WHANG*. Stars spun. When consciousness returned, he was on the ground. His head burned with pain. He touched it—there was already a large bump. The "bald bandit" with the cudgel was glaring sideways.

"Do you know manners? Opening your mouth with 'this master,' closing your mouth with 'this master'—am I the same generation as your father?"

Lin Gonglao nearly fainted from rage. But "wise men don't fight impossible odds"—he understood that much. He silently rose, prepared to leave.

"Stop!" The voice came from behind. Lin Gonglao suppressed his fury, trying to appear mild:

"What?"

"You're so strong—help the old man carry his things."

"!" Lin Gonglao almost exploded—but the throbbing head reminded him: times changed. Reluctantly, he picked up a basket from Wang Sangou, who frantically declined.

"Did you eat dog food?" The man's words were vicious and cutting. "A young fellow takes just this?"

Lin Gonglao silently picked up two more bundles, mentally cursing these bald bandits' eighteen generations of ancestors.

Walking through, there was a sudden burst of laughter. Without looking he knew: it wasn't the Lin clan—it must be laborers and such. People who formerly smiled obsequiously, not daring to look, now dared to laugh at him!

Seething with resentment, he followed the crowd to the gangplank. Straw packs were piled—everyone got one. Opening it, he found a bamboo tube with a stopper—apparently water. There was also a paper-wrapped item—tearing it slightly, he saw biscuits.

Thoughtful preparation. Lin Gonglao touched his head bump, wondering what the future held. He was slightly afraid, understanding a simple truth: the world wasn't just Baitu Village.

Zhou Dongtian smugly returned to the stern castle. Li Haiping chuckled: "You're quite the justice warrior."

"With such brats, you must knock off their arrogance—otherwise there'll be more trouble later. This world is OURS!" Zhou Dongtian twirled his cudgel. "I even held back—otherwise there'd be no visible injuries, but internal damage—"

"Careful—making corpses useless." Li Haiping privately wondered: why did the Executive Committee send this printer here? Probably for interrogations—he and Zhou shared quarters, often seeing him return late, smiling mysteriously. Later he learned: the Security Group called him for every interrogation.

Wen Desi—after sending the first wave—personally inspected the confiscated treasures. There was abundant timber: camphor, fir, pine—over 500 logs. Various hardwoods: Hainan sandalwood, Guangdong lychee wood, ironwood—over 100 logs. 1000+ bamboo poles. Also pig iron, tung oil, yellow hemp, white hemp, palm fiber, and oyster shells.

In the warehouses, there were various ship fittings including several forged four-claw iron anchors. Abundant sails, ropes, and nails. Many weapons. Wen Desi's inspection found 10+ cannons—all British-made, specifically East India Company cast 24-pounder ship guns—short-barreled carronades unique to Britain. The "unusable" muskets were British-made matchlocks. The British were active here.

According to Shipwright Zhang: "Red-hairs" sometimes came for fresh water and minor repairs. They paid with powder, weapons, and foreign silver.

"You can repair red-hair ships?" Wen Desi asked.

"Red-hair ships differ from ours—but ships are ships," Shipwright Zhang said respectfully. He was in his early forties, had the best craftsmanship, built large ships, and had "many ingenious ideas."

"Could you BUILD red-hair ships?"

"The sails—" He hesitated. "Not enough cloth." Thinking. "Also—sail rigging is complex. Operating mechanisms are intricate. Without foreign craftsmen, I probably can't replicate them."

"These I know—"

Shipwright Zhang glanced at this "bald person" in surprise. Such a pampered gentleman understood these things?

"Then I'm willing to try."

"What's your name?"

"This humble Zhang Jiqi."

Wen Desi paused, then laughed: "Good, good. Coming to our place—you'll truly live up to your name."
