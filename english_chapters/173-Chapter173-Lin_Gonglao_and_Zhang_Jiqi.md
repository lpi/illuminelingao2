# Chapter 173: Lin Gonglao and Zhang Jiqi

Transporting people and materials: previous Gou-Manor experience was overland. This time—all sea-transport to accumulate experience for future mass-migrations.

"Navy can send landing-craft." Chen Haiyang said. "*Dengyingzhou* handles Guangzhou cargo—can't move."

"How much can *Fubo* carry?"

"About 70-80 people." Chen Haiyang sketched calculations. "Less than *Dengyingzhou*—cannons and ammunition occupy tonnage."

"Six transport-ships?"

"All small—each 30-40 people." Chen Haiyang calculated. "We also captured village's two 200-*liao* ships plus 5-6 small-boats. All usable—capacity's no-problem."

"How long by sea?"

"Sailboats generously-estimated—two days."

"Provisions?"

"Grassland-5 works. Stuff's durable. Filling." Chen Haiyang obviously disliked hard rice-cakes.

"People-transport's no-problem—one wave with big-ships handles it. Common-folk have few-possessions. But timber, iron, hemp, tung-oil occupy tonnage."

Xi Yazhou said: "Army should partially-withdraw. Five platoons and three cannons deployed—home's somewhat-empty."

Dongmen Chuiyu said: "Starting tomorrow—each departing-ship takes one-squad. Troop-transport and escort combined. Leave one-platoon until new-ship launches. Is Bopu prepared? 500+ people arriving suddenly!"

"Wu De has plan. Housing's still-building. They'll first use quarantine-camp—currently empty."

"*Fubo* here—does it affect Bopu's defenses? Situation's tense." Wen Desi recalled.

"Four fishing-trawlers are enough. They all have breech-loading-cannon. High-mobility, high-speed, high-firepower—anyone attacking is suicide."

"Tomorrow—first-wave moves entire Lin/Lu families." Wen Desi's lips curved slightly. "Leave Shipwright Zhang to continue-building."

Next-day—entire Baitu erupted. Adults shouting, children crying, women wailing. Transmigrators were prepared: who goes first, who later—distributed five-color paper-slips.

Beach had rope-lanes with matching color-flags. Slip-holders followed-color to correct-ships—no confusion. Ships specially brought hundreds of strapped-rattan-baskets and rope for luggage.

"Can this old-ticket still board your-ship..." Li Haiping hummed on *Fubo's* stern-castle, watching struggling streams of elderly-with-young, bundle-laden people—shuffling under soldiers' urging.

Lin Gonglao glanced at the humming "bald-bandit." Strange tune—like their strange-clothing. Clan-elder called them "Chiefs"—bowing obsequiously. Feared their firearms: that checkpoint-stockade, including purchased-cannon, cost village hundreds-of-*liang*. Short-workers stationed there also expensive. Local hundreds of bandits couldn't touch it—they smashed it in minutes.

Now captured—future unknown. Lin Gonglao was especially-annoyed. He was Lin-clan member—clan-leader was his-uncle. Born in Baitu—never suffered hardship—belonging to village's "ruling class." Like other Lin/Lu second-generation, he had no-interest in ancestors' crafts—learned only basics. Preferred martial-arts—leading short-workers drilling, dragging anyone annoying to Shenming-Pavilion for beatings. Eight directions of swagger.

Obviously those days were-over. Growing-annoyed—suddenly someone bumped his-back. Turning: Wang Sangou—fifty-something bachelor, clan-kept laborer—basically Lin-clan's communal-slave.

Already irritated—now struck by slave—his-back ached. Rage erupted: raised-palm, slapped; raised-leg, kicked:

"Coffin-scraper! Got no-eyes?!"

Wang Sangou—loaded with bags—was shuffling along. Palm-and-kick sent him sprawling. Several young Lin-clansmen saw his-ridiculous-pose—laughing. Older-ones grimaced—quickly pulling away laughing-children.

This striking-and-cursing blocked the-queue. Soldiers rushed over to clear-jam. Li Haiping saw everything clearly from stern-castle—shook head. Such tiny-place—already petty-tyrants.

"Who's that?" Someone asked.

"Lin-clan apparently. Heard kid's quite-arrogant. Even after clan-elder surrendered—he was still-resentful." Li Haiping said casually.

"Such tough-character?"

Lin Gonglao—after beating Wang Sangou—felt-refreshed. Victoriously added more-kicks. Getting enthusiastic—a burly-man pushed through, carrying-cudgel.

"What's going on?!" Man bellowed. "Nothing better than fighting?!"

"I dare-not." Wang Sangou scrambled up, begging. "No fighting—no fighting—"

Lin Gonglao was still-young, hot-blooded—hadn't adjusted to changed-status—arrogantly-faced:

"I'm beating my-slave—what's it—"

Mid-sentence—head *WHANG*. Stars spinning—when consciousness returned, he was on-ground. Head burning-painful. Touched—already large-bump. "Bald-bandit" with cudgel glaring-sideways.

"Know manners? Opening-mouth 'this-master' closing-mouth 'this-master'—same-generation as your-father?"

Lin Gonglao nearly-fainted from-rage. But "wise-men-don't-fight-impossible-odds"—he understood. Silently rose—prepared leaving.

"Stop!" Voice came from-behind. Lin Gonglao suppressed fury, trying appearing-mild:

"What?"

"You're so-strong—help old-man carry things."

"!" Lin Gonglao almost-exploded—but throbbing-head reminded him: times-changed. Reluctantly picked-up basket from Wang Sangou—who frantically-declined.

"Ate dog-food?" Man's words were vicious-and-cutting. "Young-fellow takes just-this?"

Lin Gonglao silently picked-up two-more bundles—mentally cursing these bald-bandits' eighteen-generations of ancestors.

Walking through—sudden burst of laughter. Without-looking he knew: not Lin-clan—must be laborers-and-such. People who formerly smiled-obsequiously, not-daring-to-look, now dared-to-laugh at him!

Seething with resentment—following crowd to gangplank. Straw-packs were piled—everyone got one. Opening: bamboo-tube with stopper—apparently water. Paper-wrapped item—tearing slightly—biscuits.

Thoughtful-preparation. Lin Gonglao touched his head-bump—wondering what future-held. Slightly-afraid—understanding simple-truth: the-world wasn't just-Baitu-Village.

Zhou Dongtian smugly returned to stern-castle. Li Haiping chuckled: "You're quite the-justice-warrior."

"Such brats—must knock-off arrogance—otherwise more-trouble later. This world is OURS!" Zhou Dongtian twirled his-cudgel. "I even held-back—otherwise no-visible-injuries, but internal-damage—"

"Careful—making corpses useless." Li Haiping privately-wondered: why did Executive-Committee send this printer here? Probably for-interrogations—he and Zhou shared-quarters, often seeing him return-late, smiling-mysteriously. Later learned: Security-Group called him for every-interrogation.

Wen Desi—after sending first-wave—personally inspected confiscated-treasures. Abundant-timber: camphor, fir, pine—500+ logs. Various-hardwoods: Hainan-sandalwood, Guangdong-lychee-wood, ironwood—100+ logs. 1000+ bamboo-poles. Also pig-iron, tung-oil, yellow-hemp, white-hemp, palm-fiber, oyster-shells.

In warehouses—various ship-fittings including several forged four-claw iron-anchors. Abundant sails, ropes, nails. Many weapons. Wen Desi's inspection found 10+ cannons—all British-made, specifically East-India-Company-cast 24-pounder ship-guns—short-barreled carronades unique-to-Britain. The "unusable" muskets were British-made matchlocks. British were active here.

Per Shipwright Zhang: "Red-hairs" sometimes came for fresh-water and minor-repairs. Paying with powder, weapons, and foreign-silver.

"You can repair red-hair ships?" Wen Desi asked.

"Red-hair ships differ from ours—but ships are ships." Shipwright Zhang said respectfully. Early-forties—best-craftsmanship, built large-ships, "many ingenious-ideas."

"Could you BUILD red-hair ships?"

"The sails—" He hesitated. "Not enough-cloth." Thinking. "Also—sail-rigging is complex. Operating-mechanisms are intricate. Without foreign-craftsmen—probably can't replicate."

"These I know—"

Shipwright Zhang glanced-surprised at this "bald-person." Such pampered-gentleman understood these-things?

"Then I'm willing to-try."

"What's your-name?"

"This-humble Zhang Jiqi."

Wen Desi paused—laughed: "Good, good. Coming to our-place—you'll truly live-up-to your-name."
