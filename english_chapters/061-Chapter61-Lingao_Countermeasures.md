# Chapter 61: The Lingao People's Countermeasures

"The reward is manageable." Magistrate Wu wore a bitter smile. Compared to the fifty taels of silver he'd already sent, thirty *shi* of rice was nothing. "Thank you for your trouble, Vice-Magistrate."

"With the whole city's safety at stake, how dare I speak of trouble? But that Commander Li drove a hard bargain. I exhausted every courtesy before he'd spare thirty men. As for the gunpowder and shot—if we don't use them, fine. If we do, we must return double." Wu Ya was nearly forty, portly and well-maintained, looking much younger than the magistrate. A minor official by background, lacking the ambitions of those from the proper examination track, he lived quite comfortably.

"One can't really blame him," Magistrate Wu said, head lowered, sighing. "Everyone from court to countryside knows the garrison system's condition. Where would he find capable soldiers? Any he has are just the old, sick, and lame who couldn't escape."

"Your Honor speaks truly." Wu Ya nodded. As they talked, a doorman announced that the county's registrar and educational supervisor had arrived. The chief constable was on patrol and couldn't come yet; the education commissioner had gone to summon the local gentry. In the Ming, the gentry held considerable power, often influencing local administration—so consulting them on major matters was always prudent.

"Gentry" was a complex class, ranging from court ministers and regional governors down to officials' families, local strongmen, and landlords—including those returned home due to mourning, dismissal, or retirement, as well as examination-qualified *juren* and *jinshi* who hadn't yet taken office. Through various connections, they maintained close ties with provincial authorities and the court—some even had direct access to the imperial palace. County officials of the seventh, eighth, or ninth rank could play lord before common people, but before these gentry, they had to be much more circumspect.

Lingao, being a remote small county, had few gentry. Those whose areas weren't threatened by pirates didn't bother coming. Those who'd built village fortifications and recruited militia to defend them naturally couldn't leave. Only gentry from the county seat and nearby districts—whose interests were directly at stake—showed up.

Seeing most had arrived, Wu Mingjin quietly asked his advisor: "Hasn't Master Liu arrived yet?"

"Returning to Your Honor—Education Commissioner Feng personally went to fetch him. He should arrive soon."

He nodded and surveyed the gentry in the hall. Over a dozen people sat there—some arrogant, some meek, some affecting profundity, stroking beards in silence.

"Gentlemen," Wu Mingjin dispensed with formalities and went straight to the point. "The current situation: a powerful pirate force has occupied Bopu and shows no sign of leaving. Giant ships and fast vessels fill the harbor. Tomorrow they'll surely move upriver, pillaging as they go—the situation is dire! Vice-Magistrate Wu risked his life leaving the city for reinforcements today. Tomorrow, thirty garrison soldiers will arrive, but garrison troops are good only for a show of force—completely unreliable!"

This severe speech set everyone murmuring uneasily. Wu Ya knew this was standard intimidation—exaggerating danger twelvefold to pressure the gentry into donating grain and silver. As senior county vice-magistrate, he knew the court's finances were utterly ruined. Last year's typhoon and flood had destroyed most of Lingao's autumn harvest, yet the court's triple levies weren't waived. The county was strapped—months behind on militia and archer pay. Now they faced pirates, needed reinforcements, had to recruit militia—all requiring money.

Seeing everyone anxious, Magistrate Wu spoke more slowly: "This official has been entrusted with this post and bears responsibility for the land. If the city survives, so do I; if it falls, I fall with it. All of you—whether from families long favored by the court, or local gentry, or examination graduates—defending this city is your duty. I ask that you join hearts and hands with me to repel these pirates and keep officials, gentry, and commoners safe. What suggestions do you have?"

Everyone hastened to rise: "We follow Your Honor's lead!"

Seeing the atmosphere favorable, Wu Mingjin revealed his plans: "Though this is a small county, the walls span over 600 *zhang*. Currently we have barely a hundred soldiers and militia, defending three gates. Meanwhile, many commoners have flooded into the city—we can't guarantee pirates haven't planted agents among them. Runners alone may not maintain order. I propose recruiting two hundred additional militia to assist in defense."

*(Note: Ming-era Lingao originally had four gates, but the north gate was long blocked—common in Hainan's Ming-era fortifications, attributed to both defense against pirates and feng shui.)*

One gentleman said: "Your Honor's loyalty truly blesses us all. However, the pirates currently remain at Bopu without advancing inland. Recruiting militia—might this cause undue alarm?"

Another quickly added: "Recruiting militia for defense is a fine strategy, but after last year's typhoon and flood, the people are impoverished. Unless truly urgent, such measures that disturb the populace shouldn't be taken!"

These slippery gentry all wore troubled expressions, pouring out grievances: the court's levies were burdensome, last year's disaster had caused tenants to starve or flee...

Some argued that the Qiongya Regional Commander's patrol boats would reach Bopu within three days; once government forces arrived, the pirates would either flee or General Tang, responsible for the territory, would surely dispatch troops from Baisha Naval Station.

Wu Mingjin's expression darkened further. Then from outside came a voice: "The city is in imminent danger, and you gentlemen haggle over a few coins!" With these words, Education Commissioner Feng entered with two attendants, carrying a middle-aged man on a rattan chair. Everyone rose to pay respects—very deferential. Even Magistrate Wu hurried forward, repeatedly calling "Elder Master."

This paralyzed middle-aged man was the famous Liu Dalin, courtesy name Mengliang—Lingao's first *jinshi* since the county was established in the Tang Dynasty, having passed in the 47th year of Wanli. But he'd become paralyzed immediately after passing and had never served.

Now just over forty, in his prime, though unable to walk, he remained devoted to local affairs. His home was inside the city's west gate. Upon receiving Magistrate Wu's invitation, he'd come without hesitation.

Wu Mingjin said: "Elder Master, what counsel do you offer?"

Liu Dalin said: "Militia must be recruited. Just because the pirates don't move now, does that mean they won't tomorrow? Would a large pirate force come just to occupy Bopu? Bopu is only thirty *li* from here—they could depart at dawn and arrive by noon. When they're at the gates and devastation begins, will your fortunes still be safe?"

He shifted his body; a household servant helped adjust his position. "With the military in such decay, you still count on Regional Commander Tang's forces?! Haven't you heard scouts report the pirates ride giant iron ships, moving without sails or oars? Even if the Baisha Naval Station deployed everything, what could they do?"

Everyone's faces grew another shade grayer. One gentleman muttered: "If even government forces are useless, what can militia accomplish?"

"Throughout history, militia and local forces have often outperformed regular soldiers! The latter merely seek their pay; the latter defend their homeland. How can they be compared?" The *jinshi* spoke eloquently. "The current strategy is to rely on ourselves, not others." He bowed to Wu Mingjin. "Your Honor, I believe recruiting militia is just one aspect." Then he presented the countermeasures he'd devised throughout the day:

1. Send messengers to every village and district, instructing local gentry to recruit militia, build earthen walls, and prepare for self-defense.

2. Implement scorched-earth policy: evacuate population, property, grain, and livestock from undefendable small villages and market towns—especially those along likely pirate routes—into the county seat.

3. Register all residents, enforce strict curfew, to prevent pirate spies from infiltrating.

4. Station scouts to monitor Bopu pirates day and night.

5. Dispatch a capable fighter with dozens of militia to waylay isolated pirates on major roads. If pirates lack supplies for long, they'll eventually withdraw.

6. Recruit more militia. Don't abandon positions outside the walls—establish stockades at each of the three gates for better defense.

He then added: "I personally donate thirty *shi* of grain!"

With the county's only *jinshi* making such a statement, others had to follow. Soon they'd pledged: this one ten *shi*, that one five taels. Within moments, they'd collected three hundred *shi* of grain and one hundred taels of silver. Wu Mingjin, seeing the *jinshi* so public-spirited—offering both strategy and grain—heaped praise and invited him to stay at the yamen as advisor. Liu Dalin didn't decline, settling in. The gentry departed to gather their contributions.

Wu Ya organized all able-bodied male refugees from sixteen to sixty into teams of ten, assigning them to the four gates to repair walls and transport bricks, stones, and rolling logs. County-school students took responsibility for wall-sector defense. Young and vigorous, still burning with youthful fire and patriotic zeal, they donned aged armor from the county armory—rusty helmets, wielding rusty swords—strutting impressively on the walls, shouting commands. Unfortunately, the weapons from the armory were so rotted that blacksmiths and carpenters worked frantically on emergency repairs.

Originally, each of the four gates had two "tiger-squat" cannons from the Zhengde era. Fortunately, they'd been test-fired during the Wanli period, confirming they still worked. Even a civilian like Wu Mingjin knew these were only for morale—completely unreliable.

Officials conferred: with so many refugees in the city, any misstep could trigger unrest. They ordered the registrar and education officials to set up gruel stations at the Confucian Temple, also serving bitter-herb tea. The chief constable led runners through the streets to maintain order. Magistrate Wu had considered executing someone to establish authority, but *Jinshi* Liu dissuaded him—killing now might spark rebellion rather than deter it. Instead, beatings became more frequent. The crack of bamboo on flesh and victims' cries echoed through every street. The commoners huddled silently in the autumn night's cold.

Meanwhile, inside the city near the north end, behind the county yamen in a narrow alley, a courtyard glowed with dim lamplight. The yard was silent. A lantern sat by the well; beside it, several iron chests. A man and woman sat on the well's stone rim, staring blankly at a tall kapok tree, silent for a long while. The autumn night was already cold; both wore felt cloaks.

The man used a rope harness to lower the chests one by one into the well. When each hit water, he shook loose the rope loop; with a splash, it vanished.

The woman stood, shaking out her long skirt, finally speaking: "Is this safe? It makes my heart pound—this is our family's accumulation over generations..."

The middle-aged man gave a cold laugh, bent to adjust the lantern, and whispered: "Even if pirates breach the city, draining this well isn't a quick job. It's extremely deep. Without this hook-and-rope rig, only immortals could retrieve them."

He removed the metal hooks, hid them beneath the kapok tree, and recoiled the rope. To the woman: "Tomorrow at first light, take everyone in the household back to your parents' home. I and Chengxuan will stay in the city."

"And you?"

"What's to fear? With the brothers backing me, escaping with our lives even if the city falls isn't difficult. Chengxuan is a county-school student—he can't leave. Magistrate Wu has long looked unfavorably on our family. If Chengxuan flees, Wu will definitely use that excuse to strip his scholarly status."

He stood, dusting his hands: "Earlier I sent the Lai brothers to deliver money to Magistrate Wu. I'm donating twenty taels, plus another ten in personal gifts..."

"Thirty taels?!" The woman cried out, distress plain on her face.

"Ha, don't worry, wife." The man's expression was confident. "If the city doesn't fall, on this thirty taels' goodwill, the contract for collecting county-district autumn taxes will fall to me again—big profits. If the city does fall..." He chuckled darkly. "I have dozens of brothers. Amid the chaos, we grab what we can and slip out—not hard at all."

He gazed at the starless, moonless night sky: "Hmph—I, Gou Dahu, am hardly one of those panic-stricken common folk!"
