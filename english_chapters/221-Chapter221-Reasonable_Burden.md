# Chapter 221: Reasonable Burden

In ancient China, tax revenue was rarely used for public services. So-called taxation was simply wealth extraction to fund the ruling class. The people's suffering and social improvement received scant attention. The public affairs and welfare services undertaken by modern governments weren't within their consideration.

Dynastic revenue was almost entirely spent on maintaining the imperial household, the military, and the bureaucracy. Even so, at the slightest disturbance, there would be cries of "insufficient state funds." The solution was simple: surcharges. Each round of surcharges was a carnival of increased income for officials at every level, and a disaster for the common people below.

Take Linggao: though the Great Ming government collected over seven thousand *shi* of regular grain taxes annually, it was hard to see what benefit these taxes actually brought to the county. In two hundred years, the government had built only one water conservancy project. The Wenshui Bridge might count as one practical government project, but after two hundred years, it was the only one.

The common people supported the government. Apart from the basic "rough peace" of bare survival, this government brought Linggao's people no benefits whatsoever. Disaster relief depended on privately organized "charity granaries." Defending against bandits required ordinary people to take up arms as militia themselves. Though a third of the annual seven thousand-plus *shi* of grain went directly to the "auxiliary stipend" for Hainan Island's garrison troops, when land bandits and sea pirates ran rampant in Linggao, the people could not count on these government soldiers they supported to come out and "suppress bandits."

If the transmigrator regime wanted to win the people's trust, they had to break this thousand-year pattern and establish a truly modernized state system. Common folk might be ignorant, but when it came to their own interests, they were absolutely not stupid. They could see who truly worked for them and sought their welfare.

The conference opened with a speech from the county's Vice-Magistrate. Wu Ya had never encountered such a situation before: his only experience was presiding over court cases, where plaintiffs and defendants knelt below, not daring to look at him, with at most some idle onlookers outside the door. Now he sat shoulder to shoulder with a group of "baldies," with several hundred local notables watching him below.

Fortunately, Wang Zhaomin had already written his speech for him. He just had to read it. This bland, inoffensive speech had been reviewed by the transmigrators to ensure it contained no hidden schemes.

There had been some bargaining over the speech's content. The transmigrators naturally wanted Linggao county yamen's support to be "clear and unambiguous," while Magistrate Wu wanted the language murky and ambiguous. So Wang Zhaomin's draft was decided upon after a full day of consultation between both sides' chief writers. Overall, everyone was satisfied.

Originally, Wu Ya hadn't wanted to come read the speech. But naturally, Old Master Wu didn't want to appear at such an occasion—it would leave him without room for future denials. So the scapegoat became Vice-Magistrate Wu. He had originally planned to use his superior rank to pressure the County Sheriff into being his scapegoat, but the "baldies" firmly refused—a Vice-Magistrate was, after all, the county's second-in-command, carrying far more persuasive weight with common folk than a half-official, half-clerk position like Sheriff.

Only under duress did Wu Ya serve as the yamen's representative. A red envelope of eighty *liang* silver from the transmigrators somewhat soothed his wounded spirit.

After Vice-Magistrate Wu spoke about the county's grave situation facing sea pirates, the importance and necessity of organizing local militia joint defense, he announced: the proposal for county-wide joint defense initiated by Damei Village had been stamped and approved by the county yamen. The militia organization would be named "Baireng Society." The government would issue related documents authorizing Baireng Society to organize, train, and command the militia.

Baireng Society would establish a "public office" at East Gate Market as the militia's administrative body. It could also collect militia funds and provisions from villages that joined the society.

The head of Baireng Society would naturally be Wu De. Though he wasn't a military leader, militia society heads were generally local gentry who dealt with the government and villages. As the newly appointed People's Commissioner for Civil Affairs, he was well-suited for this government position. Moreover, this position would introduce him to the county's prominent figures, facilitating future work.

Wu De wasn't wearing training clothes. In fact, all transmigrators attending today's meeting dressed more formally than usual. Of course, "formal" didn't mean suits and ties—just not the colorful training uniforms of everyday. Today he wore an '87-style blue Navy officer's spring-autumn dress uniform without rank insignia. It looked quite dignified.

Wu De's speech was in Mandarin, with Xiong Buyou and several others providing simultaneous interpretation into Linggao dialect, Hainan Mandarin, and Hokkien.

Wu De said: Baireng Society would prioritize the interests of the entire county's people, strive to shoulder the responsibility of maintaining county-wide peace, and under the correct guidance of Emperor Chongzhen, with the care and concern of Linggao county yamen's officials at all levels, and with the support of the county's gentry and common folk, Baireng Society would unwaveringly continue upholding the principle of "eliminating the strong and supporting the weak, protecting the territory and securing the people," making new contributions to the stability and prosperity of all Linggao and the creation of a harmonious Great Ming society.

This novel-sounding boilerplate intrigued the attendees. The only shortcoming was that when Wu De mentioned Emperor Chongzhen, Wu Ya and others on the podium immediately stood and shouted "Long live the Emperor," while the various delegates below dropped to their knees with a rustle.

After this glorious and correct boilerplate was finished, the meeting moved to the main agenda: levying grain and labor.

The newly appointed People's Commissioner for Civil Affairs, Wu De, approached this matter cautiously. After all, levying grain and labor was complex and delicate work. The transmigrators had neither governmental authority nor detailed information—only the deterrent of force. Based on their consistent experience, such burdens typically fell on society's lowest strata. Since they couldn't yet change the social structure, the only option was to keep grain levies within bearable limits and avoid excessive exaction.

Therefore, this burden imposed by the transmigrator collective on Linggao's people was named the "Reasonable Burden."

***

The "Reasonable Burden" plan collected on a village-by-village basis. Each village would report its own capacity.

The self-reporting format was adopted because the transmigrators temporarily lacked time to conduct a complete survey of the county's land and harvests, making precise burden control difficult. Though obtaining the tax registry data from the yamen wasn't too difficult, such records were quite inaccurate, even riddled with errors. Officials only treasured them because they were the sole basis for collecting grain taxes. Land concealment in late Ming was extremely serious; the registries couldn't reflect villages' actual production levels at all. Using data from these books would only worsen the already unreasonable tax burden.

Though some transmigrators thought self-reporting would lead to underreporting, Wu De pointed out that even with concealment, it was better than using the registries. First, each village knew its actual production, so reported figures at least wouldn't exceed what they could bear. Second, given their current authority and the legend of "commanding supernatural powers," villages' reported figures wouldn't be too low—they wouldn't dare fool the transmigrators. If such cases did occur, they could make an example of one to warn a hundred. Third, Wu De believed this approach demonstrated the spirit of equal consultation, beneficial for winning hearts and minds.

Sure enough, when this method was announced, every village breathed a sigh of relief. They'd feared the transmigrator collective would make outrageous demands. Now they just needed to self-report their "voluntary contributions."

Everyone understood this kind of voluntary contribution. Whenever the government had major projects, they'd resort to "voluntary contributions" or "happy donations" and such. These were easier to deal with than regular grain taxes, and with some bribes to the handling clerks, you could even bargain.

"Everyone report figures based on your village's actual situation—contribute according to your ability," Wu De said amiably.

The venue immediately buzzed with discussion. The village delegates had originally expected to receive a number to take home. Now it was self-reporting, and some felt they couldn't decide on their own—after all, once a figure was reported, it became law. Reporting too much or too little would both be inappropriate.

Huang Bingkun saw an opportunity and deliberately said, "This is a major village matter. We can't decide ourselves—we need to go back and discuss."

The people around him thought this reasonable. Someone stood up requesting to go back and consult with the village elders before reporting. Many others chimed in.

*Good,* Huang Bingkun thought. With so many villages at various distances, going back and returning would take at least four or five days. Add the wrangling in the village—that would take several more days. By the time they reconvened, it would be at least half a month later.

Wu De was prepared for this situation. He asked villages to first tally how many could decide their "Reasonable Burden" amount on the spot, and how many needed to go back and discuss. They should submit the lists.

After tallying: about eighty villages could decide on the spot; the other two hundred-some said they needed to go back and discuss.

"Those who can decide on the spot, report your figures shortly," Wu De announced. "Those who need to discuss, go back after the meeting. Report your figures to the public office by the fifteenth of the second month."

With that, Huang Bingkun's hope that the meeting would adjourn first was completely dashed. The conference continued.

After the "Reasonable Burden" was decided, Wu De announced the labor levy requirements.

The labor levy problem was far more difficult than "Reasonable Burden." Linggao didn't lack land—it lacked labor. Though migrants from the mainland entered the county each year, due to acclimatization issues, mortality was high. For small households, labor was the family's survival guarantee. For wealthy households, labor meant acquiring more wealth—so even those with many farmhands, servants, and tenants were unwilling to send people to work.
