# Chapter 1332 - After Returning Home

"In broad daylight and public view, ignoring the distinction between men and women, openly embracing—what kind of behavior is this!" When Huang Bingkun heard this servant actually dare to ask his master "why," he couldn't help getting angry. He immediately assumed the authority of a master and began to scold: "You're a decent, respectable family's son—you absolutely must not learn the ways of dissolute good-for-nothings!"

Huang Ping didn't dare talk back, but his entire face showed defiance. Huang Bingkun softened his tone again: "You're not young anymore. If that girl is from a decent, respectable family, I'll arrange to propose marriage on your behalf, get the betrothal settled, and have you two married next year or the year after."

He had assumed Huang Ping would be grateful to the point of tears. Instead, Huang Ping showed a shocked expression:

"Second Young Master, absolutely not..."

"Why not?"

"Students at the school aren't allowed to become betrothed, let alone marry..."

"If it's not allowed, then why did you carry on with her like... like that?" Huang Bingkun said earnestly. "You're a scholar now. Scholars must have a good reputation. The girl also has her virtue to protect."

"Second Young Master, that girl and I just like each other... we haven't, haven't thought of that..." Huang Ping stammered.

"Then what exactly are you thinking?!" Huang Bingkun was becoming confused.

Huang Ping's face showed an expression of "I can't explain it to you." He could only say reluctantly: "She and I are just friends. We both like each other very much..."

Huang Bingkun felt overwhelmed with information. After racking his brains for a while, he finally found an appropriate term: "So she's like a female confidante?"

"I guess that's... about what it means." Huang Ping breathed a sigh of relief.

"What kind of family is she from?" Huang Bingkun still pressed on.

Huang Ping had no choice: "She's from a naturalized citizen family. Her hometown is in Guangdong. Her parents now work at a farm under the Agricultural Committee..."

When Huang Bingkun heard that her parents weren't of some lowly origin but came from a respectable farming background, he felt somewhat relieved. He said solemnly:

"Since you don't want to become betrothed to her, you must never again engage in such improper conduct in public!" Huang Bingkun admonished him earnestly.

Huang Ping could only reply: "Yes, this humble one understands."

When Huang Bingkun returned to the Huang Family Stockade, he learned that his father had just decided to contract out about a thousand thin *mu* of land under the Huang family name to the Tiandihui. This news shocked him greatly. What shocked him even more was that his father had actually disbanded the Huang Family Stockade's militia because of this.

To demonstrate cooperation, the Huang family had already purchased the Tiandihui's agricultural technology services last year. Although the original motivation had been merely to go through the motions and buy some peace, unexpectedly the Tiandihui's technology services had more than doubled the Huang family's income last year. This made Old Master Huang and the eldest young master—who had originally been wary of the Tiandihui's intentions and goals—develop an interest in the Tiandihui. The two discussed that the family had nearly a thousand *mu* of thin farmland. When tenanted out to tenants, they could scarcely collect any rent—if they insisted on collecting rent, the tenants would probably starve to death. And since the Huang Family Stockade's tenants were the main source of militia, the Huang family naturally didn't want to offend them too much.

Now that Lingao's situation had become clear and public order was good, the Huang family no longer needed to spend vast amounts of manpower and resources to continue "organizing a militia"—maintaining a militia of several hundred men was very expensive, and everyone in the Huang Family Stockade had long complained bitterly about this.

In the past, it had been for "survival" in the chaotic social order—they had no choice. Now that bandits had been cleared out and with a formidable force like the Bofan Army present, even the Li people didn't dare cause trouble. Spending money to maintain a militia far exceeding the stockade's scale was simply uneconomical. There had long been calls to completely abolish the militia.

This time, Old Master Huang directly disbanded most of the militia, retaining only a few dozen based on the village's population as the "village militia" that the pirates required every village to maintain.

This way, the Huang family no longer needed to continue this unprofitable business just to support the militia. The Huang family's eldest son, Huang Bingcheng, had specifically gone to visit the Tiandihui, met with Ye Yuming, and reached a business cooperation agreement to "fully contract out" these lands and the tenants on them to the Tiandihui.

When Huang Bingkun heard about the militia disbandment and the land contracting, he was greatly alarmed—this was self-amputation! The reason the Huang Family Stockade had always enjoyed a lofty position in Lingao was directly related to their family's generations of organizing militia and always being the "pillar" of the countryside. Now, disbanding the militia and contracting out the land and tenants—didn't Father know that the most important resource in Lingao was population? These tenants were "old households" who had accumulated over many years; many had fought alongside Grandfather and Father. Even if they didn't fight, so many people were a rare treasure. How had Father suddenly become so muddle-headed?

He hurried to find his father and elder brother, but couldn't find them—the servants said the master and eldest young master were both in the flower hall receiving Squire Song from Chengmai.

This Squire Song was a longtime friend of the Huang family—not only a longtime friend but also the father-in-law of the Huang family's eldest son. The relationship was extraordinary. Huang Bingkun hurried to the flower hall.

In the flower hall, Squire Song Zongmao was holding forth on various topics. He said he had come to visit and see his daughter and grandson. But everyone knew Squire Song had come to seek advice.

The Song family was a prominent clan in Chengmai County. Song Zonghui, formerly the wealthiest man in Chengmai, was Song Zongmao's cousin. Although Song Zongmao wasn't as wealthy as this cousin, he was still a modest landlord, owning several thousand *mu* of land. All this land had originally been tenanted out. Since the Australians had defeated the government troops, established a "Post-War Bureau" in Chengmai County, and then established a "Chengmai County Office" and "Chengmai County Consultative Bureau," Chengmai too had been gradually undergoing changes like Lingao.

Bandit suppression, land surveying, population census, clarifying taxes, implementing new tax systems... step by step these had been carried out. Although Song Zongmao had some complaints about certain policies, Chengmai had at least taken on a new appearance. The area was peaceful; whether rich or poor, everyone's days were more stable than before.

But the Australians' recent actions had truly thrown him into a panic. The Agricultural Committee was reclaiming wasteland and establishing farms on a grand scale in Chengmai, aggressively recruiting farm workers with allegedly generous treatment. Not only had the hired hands—who used to come just for a full stomach—quit one after another, but even the tenants were demanding rent reductions. If rents weren't reduced, they threatened to give up their tenancies. As the tenants put it: now that the Australians had arrived, working as hired hands for them meant not only eating well but also having housing—much better than being tenant farmers who never got enough to eat all year round.

With all this commotion, Squire Song could no longer sit still. Since the land survey and the implementation of the new tax system, his tax burden had increased considerably compared to before. Moreover, with large quantities of Australian goods flowing into Chengmai, consumption expenditures in this area had increased dramatically. Squire Song had originally planned to raise rents, but now, far from raising rents, it was questionable whether he would have anyone to farm his land this year.

In his anxiety, Squire Song thought of his in-law, who was a committee member of the Lingao Consultative Bureau. Being a committee member, he surely had close relations with the Australians. And Lingao was the Australians' home base, so he came to seek advice.

"...Ah, who would have thought that fifty thousand imperial troops would be wiped out in just a few days. When the imperial forces came, I contributed quite a lot of money and grain from my estate—nearly emptied my stores. Truly harmful! That hole still hasn't been filled. I had hoped that with a few years of peace, I could slowly make it up, but the Australians have pulled this stunt! Are they going to leave us any way to survive? These troublemaking commoners! Back then, if I hadn't taken pity on them and leased them my lands, they'd have been corpses long ago. Now they dare say such disrespectful things to my face. Really, really..." Song Zongmao kept shaking his head as he spoke.

Under Council rule, the burden on rentier landlords was heavy. After the comprehensive land survey, they lost the benefits from their hidden fields. After the new tax system was implemented, not only were the Ming dynasty's overt tax exemptions abolished, but all the various cheating and tax-evasion tricks they used to play by colluding with petty officials were rendered null and void. This alone had landlords crying in distress. Moreover, they had to pay progressive agricultural taxes at higher rates based on the progressive scale. This had bankrupted many rentier landlords, forcing them to sell their land and move to the city to work in industry or commerce. Those who remained had to change their approach, either subcontracting their land to the Tiandihui or transforming to manage their land themselves.

Huang Shoutong offered consolation: "This is the trend of the times. Since tenanting out is so troublesome, why not simply contract it to the Tiandihui? No matter how troublesome the tenants are, let the Australians reason with them."

"Contracting to the Tiandihui would indeed be less troublesome. It's just that I've never dealt with them before and don't know if they can be trusted." Squire Song said. His worry was that the Tiandihui might act like certain large households—turning hostile after receiving a "donation" and swallowing his land.

Huang Shoutong immediately assured him that the Tiandihui was reliable. His own family's cooperation with the Australians had yielded good returns, so this year he planned to contract out all his consolidated lands along with the tenants on them to the Tiandihui for cultivation.

"The Australians can be trusted to keep their word. On this point, Squire Song need not worry excessively."

After Huang Shoutong's explanation, Squire Song's mind became more active. Rather than fighting with the tenants and having no one come out well, simply contracting to the Tiandihui was a way out.

Then he moved on to inquire about a second matter.

"I've heard the Australians have established an 'Australian Academy' in Lingao?"

"Indeed, it's been operating for several years now. It's called Fangcao Di."

"I've heard quite a few children of Lingao gentry and prominent families have enrolled there?"

"Quite a few."

Song Zongmao hemmed and hawed, explaining that some time ago he had heard that his cousin Song Zonghui had sent a son to Lingao to attend school. This gave Song Zongmao a sense of crisis. Song Zonghui was already a committee member of the County Consultative Bureau, a favorite of the Australians. If he also sent a son to study in Lingao, it was obviously sending a "hostage" as a pledge of loyalty. His own family hadn't managed to become a committee member; if he fell behind in this respect too, would he have any say in county affairs in the future? Although they were of the same clan, they were after all distantly related branches.
