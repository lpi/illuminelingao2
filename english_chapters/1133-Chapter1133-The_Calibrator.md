# Chapter 1133 - The Calibrator

Dr. Zhong turned on his desk lamp and set to work on his "Complete Intellectual Property" calibrator. All components of this calibrator were things Lingao's industry could currently self-produce or would be able to produce in the near future.

The amplifier on this "Complete Independent Intellectual Property" calibrator was a vacuum tube—Lingao's industrial system couldn't yet produce such things. Dr. Zhong's vacuum tube had been requisitioned from the Planning Committee's warehouse. Wude had solemnly told him to use it carefully, as their stockpile of vacuum tubes wasn't large.

As for the paper tape used in traditional calibrators, he'd substituted a frosted glass drum for paper, with a drip head marking water drops on the frosted glass drum. For this, he'd specially ordered a batch of high-precision frosted glass drums from Xiao Bailang. The principle was simple, but assembly wasn't easy. Dr. Zhong wasn't a skilled fitter by training, so his ability to fit and grind was quite amateurish. Wastage was high, and he had to prepare considerable spare parts for prototyping.

While he worked, Zhong Xiaoying quietly began grinding tools at her own workbench. As a clocksmith, though complete tool sets could be purchased ready-made, one still needed to do one's own grinding and modification. Knowing how to grind tweezers, screwdrivers, and other basic tools was fundamental for clocksmiths.

Tweezers had to be ground smooth and sharp so that picking up components wouldn't cause them to fly away or damage them, or scratch baseplates and other parts.

Every watch movement's screws had different slot widths, requiring adjustment of the screwdriver width to avoid damaging screws. Screwdriver thickness varied with different screws; it had to be ground until the screwdriver fit tightly with the screw, inserted all the way to the bottom of the slot to meet requirements.

Zhong Xiaoying had quite a talent for this work, so now all of Dr. Zhong's tool grinding was delegated to her.

"You should go to bed. It's very late," Zhong Lishi said with his back turned. "There's a whole day's work tomorrow."

"Honorable Father hasn't rested; how dare your daughter rest? Your daughter isn't tired. I'm happy to do this small thing for Honorable Father."

Zhong Lishi smiled silently. "Very well. Come with me to the observatory later."

This wasn't a whim—Dr. Zhong had submitted this proposal some time ago. To facilitate his work, he needed to let his adopted daughter access the Committee's core equipment. For this, he'd specifically submitted an application, followed by a long wait—only a few days ago had he received the written approval.

Zhong Xiaoying's face flushed with excitement—the observatory had always been their "forbidden zone." She knew that besides Committee members, no naturalized citizen had ever set foot inside.

Honorable Father trusted her so much—he clearly saw her as a true daughter. A surge of warmth welled up in Zhong Xiaoying's chest. She set down her tools, walked to Zhong Lishi's side, dropped to her knees, and kowtowed heavily three times: "Thank you, Honorable Father!"

Dr. Zhong was startled, nearly dropping his tools. Though sudden, his heart also felt warm. He spoke gently: "Get up. We needn't stand on such ceremony between father and daughter."

Just as he spoke, the electronic timer on the desk began beeping. It was 23:45. He needed to reach the observatory before midnight to calibrate the time. Dr. Zhong stood up and pocketed a wooden box from the desk.

Zhong Xiaoying had already fetched their wind coats. A corridor connected the workshop to the observatory, but it wasn't fully enclosed. Wind and rain could intrude during storms.

Dr. Zhong silently put on his coat. "You put on your jacket too. It's windy outside."

"Yes. Thank you for Honorable Father's concern." Zhong Xiaoying also put on her wind coat, then took a lantern to light the way ahead—the corridor had no lighting.

Outside, wind and rain raged; it was dark and cold. The two groped their way through the corridor to the observatory. The observatory was a three-story red brick building. The brick-paved plaza before the main entrance had the "Primordial Meridian" inlaid in bronze—actually the 110-degree east longitude line passing through this location.

The corridor led to the observatory's back door. Dr. Zhong pulled out his keyring and, by touch, selected a key to open the steel security door.

The observatory's base was a space with a ceiling reaching to the third floor. The second floor was a gallery, with a spiral staircase leading directly to the rooftop on the third floor. The rooftop had a simple observation platform with a manually-opening roof. Installed on the platform was the best astronomical telescope the Committee possessed—of course, by astronomical standards, it was merely amateur-grade, but by this timeline's standards, it was a "divine artifact."

Dr. Zhong rarely tinkered with that divine artifact. What he usually focused on was the transit instrument precisely installed on the 110-degree east longitude line beside it. The transit instrument observed stars crossing the upper meridian (crossing the observatory's meridian circle) to precisely determine the moment of crossing, deriving the astronomical clock's error, thereby establishing universal time, stellar right ascension, and the longitude of fundamental astronomical points.

This device was invented in the seventeenth century, but at this point in time, Lingao's transit instrument was unique in the entire world—not to mention it had been manufactured in a twenty-first-century timeline.

One important purpose of astronomy in ancient societies was timekeeping. Using a transit instrument for timekeeping and longitude/latitude determination was a mature method. Under human-operated observation conditions at an observatory, second-level accuracy was achievable.

The Science Department possessed complete longitude and latitude data. Combined with astronomical software, they could produce accurate star charts. Paired with observations of sunrise and sunset times, they could provide timekeeping accurate to the second. Even in the twenty-first century with precise atomic time, astronomical time still had to be used for verification.

All this work, up to now, had been done by Dr. Zhong himself. Astronomical observation was extremely tedious and time-consuming. He couldn't spend all his time on this—otherwise, he'd have no time for anything else. He still had the radio project to tackle.

Xiaoying was a very meticulous girl who could also "sit still." He planned to gradually train her to conduct astronomical observations and teach her the principles of timekeeping—not just to be a clocksmith.

But today he didn't take her to the rooftop—the wind and rain outside were too fierce to observe celestial phenomena with the transit instrument. He turned on the electric lights, and illumination immediately filled the entire space.

The observatory had much high-precision equipment that required electricity, so the Planning Committee had generously installed a wind power and a solar power generation system here. Electric lights were installed throughout the building for fire prevention.

He led Zhong Xiaoying to the base of the stairs. There, hidden in shadow, was a door—also an original security door. Opening the security door, Dr. Zhong turned on the electric light, revealing a descending staircase.

"Honorable Father—"

"Go on down." Zhong Lishi spoke, then turned back to lock the door.

The two descended a dozen or so levels of stairs before Dr. Zhong turned on another light. They'd arrived at a spacious room—a semi-basement with sturdy reinforced concrete beams and columns. Thick thermal insulation and moisture-proofing materials lined the walls and ceiling.

In the room, various strange pieces of equipment sat on specially-made racks, all covered with glass cases. Some she recognized—clocks from the workshop. Others she'd never seen before, displaying blinking red characters.

Dr. Zhong walked to the wall and checked the temperature and humidity recorders—products from the old timeline, used to monitor the basement's constant temperature and humidity environment.

This basement housed the most critical items in the Committee's timekeeping system: the reference clocks.

There wasn't just one reference clock, but several. One was a backup clock from a PHS base station. Several others were backup marine chronometers from the *Fengcheng* ship. They precisely displayed Beijing time and Greenwich time from another timeline.

Because of the importance of the time they recorded, these clocks had always been kept in the Planning Committee's special warehouse on Gaoshan Ridge, meticulously maintained in a constant temperature and humidity environment, serving as the critical time standard. Until Taibai Observatory was formally established, all Committee timepieces were calibrated against these reference clocks.
