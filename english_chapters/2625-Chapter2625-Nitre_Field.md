# Chapter 2625: Nitre Field

At this moment, the image of the two Senators grew a few points taller in Chen Wuren's heart. In the Ming Dynasty, the concept of clans prevailed. The Yamen could only manage up to the county level. So-called imperial power did not go down to the countryside. Order in the countryside was mainly maintained by clan rules. Even if reported to officials, the County Magistrate wouldn't manage "domestic affairs."

But Chen Wuren still reminded kindly: "Chiefs have good hearts, but subordinate has a sentence not knowing whether proper to say or not."

"Speak without reserve."

"Since ancient times, honest officials find it hard to judge domestic affairs. If this case is judged improperly, fear it damages the Senate's reputation."

Zhang Xiao understood Chen Wuren's worry, turned to Zhang Jiayu, preparing to test him, asking: "Jiayu, what opinion do you have?"

Zhang Jiayu said: "Student accompanied Hening to the countryside, was at the scene then. Huang *Shi* and son are truly pitiful, hearers shed tears. However, truly as Section Chief Chen said, honest officials find it hard to judge domestic affairs. Student thinks two Chiefs shouldn't intervene in this matter."

"Oh? Implication is not managing it?" Zhang Xiao asked.

"No, no," Zhang Jiayu explained: "Student thinks, better let Hening manage this matter."

"Hey, this idea is good. Let me think," Zhang Xiao smiled: "Hening, now you are a person of the Women's Federation. First give you a title of Special Commissioner of Guangzhou Municipal Women's Federation. Later I'll find Prefect Liu to issue an appointment letter for you, the kind with official seal stamped. We not only want to manage, but also manage with justifiable reasons!"

Zhao Hening couldn't conceal excitement on her face, but said with her mouth: "For justice, I'll wrong myself a bit."

"Athlete is here, still lacking referee," Li Yao'er said, "Guangzhou Circuit Court people are now in Longshan's Dagang Market, not far from here. Tomorrow morning send a messenger rushing to Dagang Market, let Yuchi Gang and Wu Yixuan of the Circuit Court come to Jiujiang immediately."

Jiujiang Qiaonan Village, located about two kilometers northwest of Jiujiang Great Market. Jiujiang Zhu Clan lived here. In the Xianchun period of Southern Song, Zhu Clan ancestor Zhu Yuanlong took clansmen trekking over mountains and rivers migrating from Nanxiong to here, already spanning over three hundred years, deeply rooted locally. Talents came forth in large numbers in the clan. Chen Zizhuang's maternal grandfather Zhu Rang reached the official rank of Prefect of Kuizhou, awarded "Grand Master of the Palace," and also left a "Good Two Thousand *Shi* Memorial Arch" in the countryside.

Fish ponds surrounded outside the village. Inside the village, behind a real estate belonging to the Zhu clan, a large piece of land was enclosed. Among them, many dried Fish Flower Ponds were separated into smaller pits by newly built pond dikes. The periphery was a circle of tall enclosing walls. Inside the enclosing walls was a scene of busyness. Those working were all Zhu clan children. Some were pouring water and lime into pits. Heat produced by quicklime and water maintained the soil at a certain temperature. Some poured filthy things like human and livestock urine, silkworm feces into mature pits, waiting quietly for the harvest time. Others were digging mature soil from old pits to mix with plant ash and send to the processing room.

If European arms dealers of the same period saw this scene, they would definitely be surprised that in the distant East, someone actually learned the "Nitre Field Nitre Making Method" invented by the French. The earliest record of Nitre Field Nitre Making Method appeared in the 14th century. By the mid-15th century Europe, it was already a magnificent sight, becoming Europe's most important source of potassium nitrate. Not only making Europeans obtain potassium nitrate no longer relying on nitre ore, but also greatly improving the purity of potassium nitrate.

This kind of "Nitre Field Method," investigating its principle, is actually summarizing the phenomenon of potassium nitrate condensing on toilet pigsty earth walls, then engaging in large-scale reproduction deep layer environment for batch production.

This technology is not complex, but didn't develop in China. No other reason; it occupies large amounts of farmyard manure. Compared to European agriculture with developed animal husbandry, Chinese traditional agriculture planting industry was highly developed, occupying almost all arable land, making livestock breeding rate extremely low. Such nitre fields requiring massive livestock fertilizer naturally couldn't develop.

When the Senate was in Hainan initially, they also considered using the Nitre Field Method to self-produce potassium nitrate. But after calculating the input-output ratio, they found they couldn't collect enough raw materials to maintain operation at all. It ended up with nothing after obtaining natural nitre from India through the Portuguese.

Who would have thought, this place actually quietly built up a nitre field of such scale. As for the Portuguese who taught this method to the Zhu clan, presumably already merged with this nitre field, disposed of unconsciously by gods or ghosts.

Zhu residence courtyard was deep, with winding corridors. Detouring past the fake mountain in the courtyard, [one] arrived at the study. Zhu Shilian put down a thread-bound book in hand, somewhat emotional, saying to the guest: "Target He (*He Zhen*, He Rubin) was a hero of a generation. Governing army strictly but with grace, seeking not a hair of private profit. Summarizing various books, hooking their mysteries and essentials, achieving *Binglu* (Treatise on Arms). Especially discussing gunpowder and firearms incisively, also having original views on firearm tactics. Pity... if Brother Shimin assisted back then, exterminating Lingao thief bandits in one drum beat (effort), wouldn't result in today's disaster."

Zhu Shilian was nearly forty, grandson of Zhu Rang, younger brother of Zhu Bolian, and also cousin of Chen Zizhuang. Chen Zizhuang grew up in Jiujiang Zhu family since childhood. Zhu Shilian was similar in age to him. The two studied and grew up together; friendship was extraordinary. The *Binglu* Zhu Shilian mentioned was He Rubin's writing, completed in the 34th year of Wanli. Five people including Chen Zizhuang, Liu Feng, wrote prefaces for *Binglu*. Zhu clan naturally also had the collection.

The one called "Brother Shimin" by Zhu Shilian was no other than Mao Yuanyi. He once followed Sun Chengzong to supervise the army in Liaodong, dealing with Later Jin in Liaodong battlefield together with Yuan Chonghuan, Sun Yuanhua and others. Printing *Wubei Zhi* in the first year of Tianqi was compiled by him studying successive generations of military books and collecting materials for many years. Later he was squeezed out by the Eunuch Party, experiencing ups and downs in the sea of officialdom. In the second year of Chongzhen when Later Jin attacked the capital, he guarded Sun Chengzong breaking out from Dongbian Gate to Tongzhou, repelling Later Jin's attack, promoted to Vice General supervising Juehua Island navy. Later dismissed due to jealousy of Minister of War Liang Tingdong, also implicated by Liaodong soldier mutiny, exiled to Fujian Zhangpu to garrison. Afterwards Liaodong situation became more severe. Even though he requested to serve the king multiple times, he was obstructed by political enemies, having to drink in grief and indignation all day.

Mao Yuanyi covered his mouth with hand and coughed a few times, saying: "Target He was a descendant of a general family, having civil and military strategy. *Binglu* has many pioneer statements. My *Wubei Zhi·Method of Using Firearms* also examined and recorded achievements of *Binglu*. I also heard about the Great Battle of Chengmai in the past. The army supervised by Target He could fight fiercely with thief bandits for several days without collapsing, already worthy of the name Iron Army, not inferior to Guanning Iron Cavalry. However, thief bandits' military skills are one notch higher; this is truly an unexpected matter."

Zhu Shilian said: "Now Governor Xiong (Xiong Wencan) is defeated. Two Guangs have no Standing Army of the Court anymore. The mansion is about to tilt. Brother Shimin, with illness in body, still risks danger to go deep into tiger's den; truly worthy of being Great Ming's Solitary Loyalist. People say Brother 'Youth came out of West Wu, name became famous at North Palace (*Beique*). Lowering curtain called scholar, mounting horse immediately general.' With Brother's assistance, this matter gains a few more points of winning chance."

Mao Yuanyi said: "Dare not accept. Zijie's (Zhu Shilian's courtesy name) clan ruined family to relieve national crisis for the chaotic country; I admire sincerely from the bottom of heart. I am originally a person with crimes, wishing to serve the country but having no door, worried and depressed causing malignant disease. I know my days are not many. Fortunately assisted by noble people in court, only then could throw myself into Yue land to serve the country. I die without regret. Just that thief bandits' power is great, cannot be rivaled by force. Raising troops still needs to wait for opportunity quietly."

Due to years of depressed heavy drinking, Mao Yuanyi died in the 13th year of Chongzhen in history, aged only forty-six. Not only that, the *Wubei Zhi* which he spent fifteen years exhausting heart and blood, collecting listed generations of military books to write and compile, was banned and destroyed once in the Qing Dynasty, only re-published in the world in the Daoguang era.

Zhu Shilian nodded knowingly, "Troops and horses not moved, provisions and fodder go first. Matter of dispensing gunpowder, still please Brother worry."

After the two talked for a moment, they went to the workshop together.

Black gunpowder production technology was already very mature by the Ming Dynasty. In early Ming, the court controlled gunpowder and firearm production very strictly, having strict secrecy measures. By mid-to-late period, due to tight Liaodong affairs, people discussing military affairs in court and wilderness were numerous. Secrecy measures relaxed somewhat. Thus the number of Fire Attack books was the most in successive generations, forming popularization of gunpowder knowledge within the scholar class. Since Foshan iron frying industry was developed, being the court's important cannon production place, there were also many artisans familiar with gunpowder and firearm knowledge in the Pearl River Delta region. Now with expert Mao Yuanyi and the family soldiers he brought, it could be counted as adding wings to a tiger.

Ming Dynasty gunpowder theory was still TCM's "Monarch, Minister, Assistant, Guide." Black gunpowder took nitre as Monarch Medicine. The long-circulated simple formula was "One Nitre Two Sulfur Three Charcoal." The proportion of sulfur and charcoal combined did not exceed one quarter. For Jiujiang region, obtaining sulfur and charcoal was not a difficult thing. Local sericulture was developed, needing sulfur, lime mostly to drive away insects and ants. Since Pearl River Delta climate was humid, silkworm cocooning had one more process of baking cocoons than Jiangnan, so charcoal was also a common easy-to-buy item. Only nitre was hard to obtain, and always a strictly controlled item by the court.

Natural nitre mines were very rare in the wild. China's nitre mostly came from three places. Produced in Sichuan called Chuan Nitre, Shanxi called Salt Nitre, Shandong called Earth Nitre. These three production areas were currently not in the Senate's controlled area. Plus connected by war fire, foreign nitre import was even less. After the Senate occupied Two Guangs, control of nitre sales was also very strict due to military demand reasons.

To obtain large amounts of nitre without attracting outsiders' attention, the Zhu clan racked their brains, finally learning the European "Nitre Field Nitre Making Method" from a Portuguese from Macau. Since Nitre Field maturation needed as long as eight months, large numbers of fish ponds needed to be converted to Nitre Fields, and not just one place. Benefiting from the Zhu family's deep roots and huge property, plus funding from local gentry headed by Chen Zizhuang and Daoist Mu Shi, they managed to organize it barely.

Gunpowder production is a dangerous and high-tech content work. After Mao Yuanyi came, he established a set of operation systems according to Ming Dynasty official gunpowder factory standards. Rewards and punishments were clear, upgrading a level compared to Zhu clan's previous self-assumed operations, also reducing production accidents and avoiding exposure.
