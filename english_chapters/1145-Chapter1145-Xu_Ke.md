# Chapter 1145 - Xu Ke

Though before a peer of the same sex, undressing still made Cleadia slightly shy. She removed her stays, still wearing her chemise. Fortunately, Zhong Xiaoying didn't go "stark naked" either, wearing a nightgown.

"Come on," she whispered. "Let's be quiet; everyone else is asleep."

Cleadia's cheeks burned—she felt her heart racing, feeling doubly ambiguous. For a moment she even doubted if she should follow her to the bathroom.

The bathroom inside wasn't large, with over ten open-sided stalls along the wall. Walls and floor were tiled, with drainage troughs on the floor. Along the wall were long wooden benches for scrubbing. People used this daily, so there were water stains on the floor.

"Come on, take off your clothes and rinse first." Zhong Xiaoying handed her the small rattan basket.

"This is a towel, this is soap—infused with lavender essential oil, special supply for Committee members. And this glass bottle is for washing hair, also lavender scented. It makes hair soft and clean." Zhong Xiaoying looked at her curly blonde hair. "Your hair is so beautiful!"

"Your long black hair is also very pretty," Cleadia said, but hesitated to undress.

Zhong Xiaoying knew she was embarrassed and turned away. "I'll wait over here. Rinse off, then come sit down; I'll help scrub your back."

Face burning, Cleadia stripped off her chemise like a thief, hurriedly hid in a stall, turned on the tap, and quickly started washing.

She washed several times in succession before bracing herself to lie on the wooden bench in front of Zhong Xiaoying, letting Zhong Xiaoying scrub her body.

"I'm using a loofah; it hurts a little."

"It's okay, I can bear it," Cleadia whispered.

Zhong Xiaoying scrubbed and rubbed with the loofah, soaping and rinsing. With great difficulty, she scrubbed off the grime accumulated on Cleadia over months, rubbing her whole body red. Under the alternating rub of loofah and soap, Cleadia's body tensed and relaxed intermittently. Her face flushed, eyes tight shut, teeth clenched, she let herself be manipulated. Yet occasionally she couldn't help emitting "mm-mm ah-ah" sounds.

Only when another scoop of clear water rinsed over her did she hear Zhong Xiaoying's slightly tired voice: "Alright, get up."

Cleadia hurriedly sat up, wet blonde hair draped over her chest, cheeks crimson, blue eyes misty as if veiled in vapor. Lips bright as blood, her curved body white tinged with pink—Zhong Xiaoying stared blankly for a moment, throat dry, and quickly looked away.

Zhong Xiaoying secretly felt it a pity. Although white women with blue eyes, blonde hair, and snow-white skin had a different charm compared to Han women, their skin felt rough to the touch, with many bumps and unevenness. After washing away the body odor and grime, there was still a faint fox-like smell—even lavender soap couldn't mask it.

"Alright, let's go get dressed." Zhong Xiaoying feigned calm, helping her up. The soap slipped from her hand; she hurriedly bent to pick it up. In her haste, her foot slipped, and she felt her cheek pressed tightly against a firm, elastic object. Her face flushed scarlet.

Stabilizing herself, she saw Cleadia's face was also full of shyness. Without a word, the two went into the changing room.

With Zhong Xiaoying's help, Cleadia changed clothes. These were specially chosen by Zhong Xiaoying, new clothes Dr. Zhong had bought for her. Their figures were similar in height and build, only Cleadia was fuller than Zhong Xiaoying, so it was somewhat tight.

Some clothes Cleadia had never seen—she'd never worn a brassiere. As Zhong Xiaoying helped her dress, she taught the method: leaning forward to fit breasts into cups, then fastening, adjusting straps. During accidental touches of tender, sensitive skin, Cleadia couldn't help a few soft gasps.

Early next morning, Dr. Zhong got up and found his daughter, usually up earlier than him, still in deep sleep. He washed up and went to the kitchen to make breakfast, encountering Westerly in the hallway.

"Morning, Westerly."

---

"Morning, Dr. Zhong," Westerly said. "Has Miss Zhong gone to the kitchen?"

"She's still resting; perhaps too tired these days," Zhong Lishi said.

"Oh, Cleadia is sleeping too," Westerly said. "We'll go to the construction site after breakfast."

At this time, less than three hundred meters from Customs, stood a prefabricated wooden building. Sentries stood guard at the door, but no sign hung there. The louvers on this building's glass windows were always closed; every night, light always shone through the cracks.

This was the Kaohsiung Office of the Political Security Bureau and the Kaohsiung Office of the Foreign Intelligence Bureau. The two agencies each occupied half the building, with stairs in the middle.

At 7:00 AM, the harbor time whistle blew. Staff inside the office building were working intensely—these two departments operated partially day and night. Operation Engine was running, and Zheng Zhilong's movements in the Taiwan Strait needed constant monitoring. Massive amounts of intelligence and material poured in, keeping everyone busy.

Xu Ke came out of his office—as the Foreign Intelligence Bureau's dedicated naval intelligence officer, he had been stationed here since Kaohsiung D-Day. The biggest maritime dangers—the Dutch and Zheng Zhilong—were active in the Taiwan Strait, and the Navy urgently needed intelligence on their activities. Xu Ke had come to Kaohsiung with this mission.

He had worked all night reading intelligence sent from various coastal locations in Fujian to provide weekly intelligence assessments to the Committee, Military Order Department, and First and Second Fleets. This was a heavy responsibility. Xu Ke had to give it his full attention. Intelligence Bureau agents were scattered across Zheng Zhilong's main operating areas, collecting news on trade goods flow, recruitment, and shipbuilding. Reporting daily dynamic changes of ships in ports.

From the current situation, Zheng Zhilong showed no abnormal movements. As he was calculating how to write the report, a guard in the hallway stopped him: "Chief, there's a sailor at the door wanting to see you. He says he's from First Fleet Headquarters, delivering a message to you. Here are his orders credentials."

"No need, I'll go to the lobby." Xu Ke wanted fresh air and to let the smoke in his office dissipate.

In the lobby, a Navy Seaman Apprentice was waiting. Seeing an unfamiliar Chief approach, he immediately stood at attention and saluted.

The guard introduced, "This is Chief Xu Ke."

"Seaman, business with me?" Xu Ke asked.

The messenger conveyed a written order from Navy People's Commissar Ming Qiu: Ordering Xu Ke to report to First Fleet Headquarters immediately.

"Go back and report; I'll come right away." Xu Ke dismissed the messenger, secretly wondering. If there was something, Ming Qiu could just call; why send someone specifically with an oral message?

Puzzled as he was, although he worked at the Foreign Intelligence Bureau now, his billet was still in the Navy. Ming Qiu was his bona fide department head.

He hurried to the washroom to wash up. Returning to the office, he was about to put on a cool cotton-linen blend shirt when he suddenly remembered he was seeing Navy leadership. He opened the wardrobe again and took out his tropical Navy Lieutenant uniform. Since being seconded to the Foreign Intelligence Bureau, he hadn't worn the uniform in a long time.

First Fleet Headquarters was located in an ordinary barracks building at Cijin Base. A naturalized Navy female Chief Petty Officer wearing clerical insignia was waiting for him at the door: "Lieutenant, I'll take you up; please follow me."

To foster a spirit of unity, inside the military, whether Committee member or naturalized citizen, formal occasions required addressing each other by rank or position. Here, the distinction between Chief and naturalized citizen didn't exist.

Arriving before the Commissar's office, the Chief Petty Officer said, "Lieutenant, you may go right in. Comrade People's Commissar is waiting for you."

"Thank you," Xu Ke replied politely.

Facing the door, Xu Ke adjusted his attire, then knocked.

"Come in." The office's occupant spoke.

"Reporting to the Commissar, Navy Lieutenant Xu Ke, reporting as ordered."

Ming Qiu sat in his chair, looking up. He wore a tropical Navy uniform with nothing but branch insignia and rank, looking neat and trim.
