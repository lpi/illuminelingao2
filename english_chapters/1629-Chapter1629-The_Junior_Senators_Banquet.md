# Chapter 1629 - The Junior Senators' Banquet

"Sigh, arguing face to face is not good!" Liu Xiang sighed in his heart and decided to be a peacemaker.

"Is our little sailor back!" Liu Xiang deliberately shouted loudly, having already arrived at the gangway of the deck. Sure enough, hearing the guest's voice, both Qian Shuixie and Qian Duoduo shut their mouths.

Then Liu Xiang saw Qian Shuixie, who looked unhappy and was still fuming, and Qian Duoduo, who had a "can't explain it to you" expression. It seemed that the uncle and niece were still holding back their anger. Just as he was about to speak to ease the atmosphere—

"Hello, Teacher Liu!" Several people followed up from behind. It was Lin Ziqi, Zhang Yunmi, and their "Girls' Sailor Team." When Liu Xiang was still an otaku in Lingao a few years ago, he also went to Fangcaodi to teach. Little Lin, Little Zhang, and these underage first-generation students had attended the comprehensive liberal arts class he taught—yes, you read that right, an engineering Ph.D. teaching a big comprehensive class of literature, history, geography, and politics, and 96 periods were arranged for one semester... Liu Xiang applying for an external post was also largely due to this reason. After all, waking up earlier than a chicken for morning study; getting off work later than a dog for evening study; and being more energetic than a cat staying up late to correct homework—continuing such a life was a terrifying thing.

Hearing Little Zhang and Little Lin greet Liu Xiang, Qian Duoduo also pouted and greeted, "Hello, Uncle Liu." When Liu Xiang was teaching, Duoduo was still the king of the children in the senior class of kindergarten. She definitely couldn't call him Teacher Liu. Besides, Liu Xiang used to run to the *Feiyun* often to participate in activities, so Duoduo's impression of him was naturally "the weird uncle who often comes to play at home."

"Good, good, good! Everyone is good!" Liu Xiang responded enthusiastically while welcoming everyone onto the deck.

"Oh my, haven't seen you for a few years, you've all grown up!" Liu Xiang's eyes swept back and forth on Zhang Yunmi several times. "Especially our Duoduo, is already a wise and mighty captain!" He exaggeratedly took a step back and saluted: "Salute to you! Senator Captain Qian Duoduo! One small step you take is a giant leap for the younger generation of the Senate!"

Unexpectedly, Qian Duoduo returned a salute very seriously: "Salute to you! Senator... Liu!"

Hearing Liu Xiang's words, Qian Shuixie curled his lips to express his dissatisfaction, but didn't say anything more. He walked towards the communication equipment on his own, preparing to report safety to Qian Shuiting and the others.

Liu Xiang also knew the two following in behind: Zhong Xiaoying, Dr. Zhong's "daughter," was a household name in the Senator circle. Everyone was waiting for the day when the sanctimonious Dr. Zhong would extend his evil hand... Sonia, well, Liu Xiang had also attended that auction, so he naturally recognized her. Qian Shuixie had just said that after the Girls' Sailor Team went out to sea once a week, they would have a dinner gathering on the *Feiyun*. Liu Xiang also greeted these two to sit down.

Zhong Xiaoying fidgeted for a while before sitting down properly—after all, she had received maid education. Although she was the adopted daughter of a Senator, she always felt inferior in front of the Chiefs. As soon as Sonia heard the greeting, she immediately sat down and started organizing the documents in her hand. Heaven knew what this naturalist had recorded again.

As soon as she sat down, Qian Duoduo, who felt "recognized" just now, began to talk about her "distant voyage feat" today with a face full of excitement. Starting from how she had a brain wave thinking of going to the opposite side of the strait, how the temporary Senator meeting was held, and how she commanded with composure, continuing all the way to how she cautiously navigated in the Juhua Islet waters full of shoals and hidden branches during the return voyage and incidentally paid respects to the naval battle site. Of course, she sensibly didn't mention a word about being severely criticized by Qian Shuixie after returning. Liu Xiang broke into a sweat while listening: *The bear child's ability to court death is indeed linearly correlated with the resources she can control to court death...*

When Qian Duoduo was narrating, Zhong Xiaoying constantly helped her make excuses, saying things like there were a huge number of patrol boats in the strait recently, the sea conditions were very good recently, and they specially called the radar station to ask about the weather. Little Lin constantly played the straight man, making the atmosphere more lively. Sonia occasionally supplemented details, such as passing a certain position where what appeared on the starboard side was a hidden sandbar emerging from the water rather than an island, or what kind of seabirds inhabited the sandbar at the entrance of Juhua Islet. Only Little Zhang sat in the sofa with a smile, gently sipping Limu Mountain Oolong tea, not interrupting, as if she was the one here to listen to the story.

When Qian Duoduo was almost at the end of her story, Qian Xuanhuang came over and said that Master had a "temporary enlarged meeting" today and couldn't come back for dinner, and Madam also had to attend the meeting... In short, Qian Shuiting and his wife were both working overtime today. The Zhou Weisen family had gone on business trips with their respective tasks a few days ago. Zheng Shangjie was of course far away in Guangzhou. Today's welcome banquet was only hosted by Qian Shuixie. To express his apology, Qian Shuixie had already gone to the kitchen personally. Secondly, Liu Xiang's little baby had woken up, and Guo Ling'er asked if she should bring the child over for the Little Chiefs to see.

It was really not easy to sort out the relationships from Qian Xuanhuang's various forms of address. Because she was a maid shared by three families, she had her own way of addressing the six masters. She called Qian Shuiting "Master," Qian Shuixie "Sir," and Zhou Weisen was specially approved to be called "Big Brother Zhou." The two wives were addressed with their surnames: Big Master and Second Master were hard to call, and Big Madam and Second Madam were easier to cause misunderstanding—later, since Zheng Shangjie was away from Lingao for a long time, Ai Beibei was directly called "Madam." As for Mendoza, according to Mendoza's own insistence, she should be called "Miss," but firstly, several masters strongly opposed it, and secondly, Qian Xuanhuang herself felt that Duoduo was the Eldest Miss. Finally, a compromise was reached to call Mendoza directly by her name. When they first came to the Feiyun Society to participate in activities, everyone lamented that Qian Xuanhuang's level of addressing was already up to the standard of the head maid of the Jia Manor.

Qian Shuixie cooked personally. Liu Xiang felt that the bigger reason was that he didn't want to watch Qian Duoduo bragging in the living room. Maybe he would get furious listening to it, so he might as well go to the kitchen and vent his anger on the ingredients. As for the baby, as soon as Qian Duoduo heard that there was a baby to hold and pinch, she immediately said excitedly that she must see it right now, immediately, at once. Liu Xiang smiled and nodded, letting Qian Xuanhuang go call Guo Ling'er.

The little baby wasn't afraid of strangers and didn't cry no matter who held her. Several girls, including Sonia, took turns holding and teasing her. It was just that Zhong Xiaoying had a look of envy—speaking of which, Zhong Xiaoying and Guo Ling'er were from the same class—holding the baby and looking at her intently. Sonia, on the other hand, swept her eyes over the baby with a look of "researching what is different about a yellow race infant," making Liu Xiang feel very unhappy. Little Lin really liked teasing children, managing to make the baby, who had been smiling sweetly and shallowly at strangers, laugh out loud. Zhang Yunmi took the baby, but for some reason, the baby was particularly affectionate towards her, first patting Little Zhang's shoulder hard, then squinting and giggling at Little Zhang for a long time about who knows what, making Zhang Yunmi stunned. Finally, the baby stayed on Zhang Yunmi and refused to get down. Qian Duoduo tried to snatch the person several times, but the baby burrowed into Zhang Yunmi's arms and refused to let go, making Qian Duoduo pout very high. Finally, Liu Xiang had to intervene to tear the baby off Zhang Yunmi and coaxed her for half a day before she agreed to let Duoduo hold her.

"Uncle Liu, I want to kiss her, why does she keep dodging!" Duoduo seemed determined to regain a bit of dignity.

"Of course! My little treasure has been taught since childhood not to let people kiss her casually!" Liu Xiang teased Duoduo deliberately.

"I want to kiss, I want to kiss, I want to kiss!" Qian Duoduo suddenly threw a childish tantrum. "Be good, give sister a kiss! Just one kiss!"

"Uncle Liu! Make the baby stop struggling, I want to kiss her little mouth!"

*The kid thinks you are playing crazy with her! How can this stop!* Liu Xiang was pestered until he had no choice but to give Qian Duoduo a trick, telling her to pout and blink at the little baby. Sure enough, the baby looked at Duoduo for a while, thought that this small lump of bright red meat was for her to eat, and bit onto Qian Duoduo's lips herself. This made Qian Duoduo overjoyed.

Qian Xuanhuang had become the de facto "First Secretary of the Feiyun Club" over the years. Setting up the plates and such was completed inadvertently, and she pushed out a high chair from somewhere for the little baby to sit—probably an original accessory of the yacht. After settling the baby, everyone sat down to eat together.

Qian Shuixie came over carrying the last main dish, Lamb Chops Boiled in Red Wine. This was a rare enjoyment here—the area currently controlled by the Senate did not produce grapes for winemaking, and 99% of the wine shipped from Europe turned into wine vinegar. And the main ingredient of this dish, lamb chops, was something that had to be pre-ordered. Leaving aside the taste, just the preparation of ingredients showed the importance attached to Liu Xiang.

"This is a rare item. Where did this wine come from? One in ten thousand?" Liu Xiang asked in surprise.

"It's a long story! Come!" Qian Shuixie poured a glass of wine for Liu Xiang and himself first. Qian Duoduo took over and filled the glasses for Little Zhang and Little Lin, and then Zhong Xiaoying poured a glass for herself and Sonia. With Sonia, the English-understanding foreign mare, present, saying "For The Senatus!" would feel all kinds of awkward. Qian Shuixie's brain turned countless circles during the time he stood up with the wine glass, and the final toast became: "For our common ideal!"

This toast came naturally to the several Senators and Junior Senators. Zhong Xiaoying, as an "adopted daughter," naturally followed suit. Sonia, however, remained silent, just standing up and raising her glass to signal. However, once the wine went down, Sonia's eyes lit up. "There is actually such mellow and sweet wine! In New Spain... no, even in Iberia, there is no good wine with such taste!" Sonia almost screamed.

"Of course! We possess the best brewing technology in the world!" Qian Duoduo was very proud.

Liu Xiang took a sip. It was indeed a very good sweet wine, and it had a very refreshing taste even without chilling. *Wait, this taste is a bit familiar!*
