# Chapter 2380: Financing (Part 11)

Zhou Wei found it very strange—the telegram calling him back was urgent. He couldn't figure out what had happened. The next day, at the crack of dawn, he hurriedly wrapped up whatever could be concluded in Foshan. Before noon, he departed on a returning patrol boat. He didn't delay along the way; even lunch was making do with military rations gnawed on the patrol boat. The forty to fifty li distance, rushing frantically, he arrived back at the Great World before dark. If it weren't for the fact that he disembarked at the Great World pier, which was a stone's throw from the office, he would have wanted to change clothes before going. He was probably going to charge straight into Guangzhou Prefecture. How come now that I've rushed to the city and contacted you, you're not in a hurry, asking me to come tomorrow? If I came back too late, you should have sent an extra-urgent marker yesterday! If it really wasn't urgent, why send an urgent telegram? Do you, Mr. Liu, have an issue with me?

Zhou Wei was full of thoughts, and his mood had soured. The planned "reward" for the two seconded guards was not given. With a cold face, he entered his "Zhou Family Fortress."

"Has there been anything these days?" Zhou Wei was about to sign the reimbursement receipts for the two guards when he routinely asked Secretary Zhou.

"Nothing major." Secretary Zhou paused, brewing her emotions, and said: "Just yesterday, some Senator I'd never heard of didn't see you, Chief, and lost his temper. He also grabbed several files from the document basket."

Zhou Wei's signing pen suddenly stopped. His arm hung in the air for more than ten seconds, trembling uncontrollably.

"Yesterday?" Zhou Wei coldly looked up at Secretary Zhou: "What time yesterday?"

Secretary Zhou, who had been putting on an act, finally managed to squeeze out a few tears and responded: "Around two o'clock, not yet three."

Zhou Wei's mouth twitched. The brass-shelled cartridge fountain pen from the old spacetime in his hand was being gripped so hard it seemed about to deform.

Snap—Zhou Wei threw his beloved pen aside. The signature wasn't signed; he'd probably have to continue borrowing those people for a while.

Zhou Wei took a deep breath, walked to the chair at the main desk in the entrance hall and sat down, then slowly exhaled. "Tell me, what happened!"

The tone was a bit heavy, and he seemed a bit angry just now, but Secretary Zhou was pleased in her heart, thinking this was Zhou Wei's anger upon hearing that she had been humiliated by some unknown Senator. Since the Chief was inquiring, she immediately deleted what should be deleted and added what she wanted to add, "recounting" yesterday's events. According to her version, it was simply some rogue of unknown origin ruining the dignity of the Nanyang Company. Anyone hearing it would think this guy claiming to be a Senator should chop off his own file-grabbing hand to show repentance, reflect well, and drink some mouse tail juice.

After hearing it, Zhou Wei's heart went cold halfway, and half his body went numb. He took another breath, exhaled and inhaled properly, before composing his expression.

Document basket?

Zhou Wei looked around. In the back left, there was a bamboo-woven basket with a cloth lining, with a rattan-woven lid on top, with several thick books weighing down the lid.

"Is it this basket?" Zhou Wei pointed at this thing he previously thought was a wastepaper basket and asked Secretary Zhou.

"Reporting to Chief, yes, this is it. To prevent anyone from grabbing things again, I specially added some heavy objects to weigh it down."

How wonderful of you!!!

Zhou Wei really wanted to personally see what deadly things were in that basket, but he found that his coordination seemed to have problems; he couldn't stand up.

"I'm not paralyzed, am I!" Zhou Wei roared in his heart. He moved his hands from his knees and placed them on the table—okay, at least no hemiplegia. Raise the foot and stomp? The thigh could be forcibly lifted, but the calf muscles were a bit stiff, and when the sole landed on the ground, it felt like thousands of silver needles were pricking—it seemed he wasn't half-paralyzed either.

Steadying his emotions, Zhou Wei ordered: "Then take everything out. What is there?"

"Quite a lot. When the Chief just came to Guangzhou, the second day you met the mayor, the third day you went to Danzhou for inspection. You told me to keep whatever came. You really predicted it well; starting from the fifth day, people kept coming. Some people just left a business card. Some left messages, all saying to meet when you're free. I've recorded them all. Some left thick stacks of documents, each saying it's very important, but I didn't see anything on the seal, so I kept them all together."

Secretary Zhou spoke while pulling things out of the document basket in handfuls. If you said she didn't do any work, everything was very well sorted, and for those who left messages, she even separately recorded them on paper. If you said she did work...

"Didn't I come back from Danzhou about ten days ago? Why didn't you show them to me then?" Zhou Wei held a "Brief Summary of Renangiang Crude Oil Development Plan in Myanmar" from seventeen days ago, his hands trembling so much that the thick envelope rustled.

Before coming to Guangzhou, he anticipated that many Senators would come to visit, promote their plans, or intend to "get involved," so he specifically instructed the secretary to record all these materials and messages well. He would look at them when he returned—even if these memoranda were just a pile of garbage, he had to show "importance."

"That day you got off the boat at the Great World, took a carriage back, went straight to sleep without even showering, and just before sleeping, you informed me to arrange another meeting with Mayor Liu the next morning. These things weren't official documents and had no confidential or urgent markings. When would you have time to look at them!"

Well thank you so much!

But that's not right. If he had never seen any private letters or memoranda sent by other Senators, Zhou Wei should have been suspicious long ago. Since these things were treated differently, then...

Zhou Wei carefully examined the various small accessories of Secretary Zhou that he hadn't paid much attention to before. He already had suspicions in his heart. Everything looked wrong, but he just couldn't precisely point out where the problem was. How about, testing her?

"The new trinkets on you are nice, quite good." Zhou Wei pinched out a pleasant expression and suddenly gave praise.

Secretary Zhou was suddenly caught off guard by this test and subconsciously pressed her hand to her chest—did he notice? Was it that special underwired bra from Store 82, or this gold chain cat's eye necklace? That shouldn't be right; the Chief shouldn't be able to see the necklace! Then it must be the bra. Does this thing really prop things up? Does the Chief really like perky ones?

"Alright, go, call Little Xu and Little Du in. I'll sign their receipt slips here."

"Yes, Chief." Secretary Zhou deliberately drew out a long note and turned around with coquettish eyes.

"Hello, Chief!" Little Xu and Little Du had just finished placing the luggage in the back hall when they heard Secretary Zhou calling and immediately came over.

"Mm, your receipt slips are signed." Zhou Wei held a slip in each hand, making a gesture to hand them over. Little Xu and Little Du stepped forward to reach out to receive them. Zhou Wei suddenly withdrew the slips, placed them on the desk and pressed down, raised his chin, and said to the two National Army soldiers: "I order: arrest Secretary Zhou!"

All three except Zhou Wei were stunned at the same time, but the two National Army soldiers were well-trained after all and quickly reacted. They turned around with a big grappling move, not caring about being gentle with the fairer sex, one person per arm, one person hooking a leg, quickly pressing Secretary Zhou to the ground.

Little Xu pulled Secretary Zhou's left arm back. Secretary Zhou screamed in pain. Little Du took the opportunity to free one hand to take over this trembling left arm, crossed it and pressed it on Secretary Zhou's back, then used his left knee to press on her waist, single-handedly controlling Secretary Zhou. Little Xu took the opportunity to straighten up, took the rope for packing luggage from his belt, first tied up Secretary Zhou's feet that were kicking wildly everywhere, then pulled the rope end and tied her hands as well.

The two quickly subdued Secretary Zhou. After completing the binding control, Little Du stood up and saluted: "Reporting to Chief! She has been controlled!"

Zhou Wei took another deep breath, looked up at the ceiling and exhaled, having sorted out his thoughts. "Thank you! But please help a bit more and act as messengers."

"We guarantee to complete the mission!" The two responded in unison.

Secretary Zhou was first stunned by the sudden attack, then with the arm pulling and the hand and foot binding, her brain had been confused the whole time. By the time Zhou Wei was talking to the two guards, she had just come to her senses—this... I'm tied up already?

In an instant, experiences and knowledge from years past surged up, scaring snot and tears to pour out together.

"Chief, spare my life! Chief! Chief, spare my life! This slave made a mistake! This slave made a mistake!"

But Zhou Wei ignored her, only finding her noisy.

"First gag her!"

"Yes, Chief!" Little Du responded and walked to Secretary Zhou lying on the ground. Zhou Wei thought he would use some cloth strips or socks to stuff her mouth, after all, that's how it's done in movies and TV shows. But Little Du skillfully took out a hard pear-shaped object from his waist pouch, pinched Secretary Zhou's jaw with his hand, and while she opened her mouth in pain, quickly stuffed it in. Secretary Zhou's mouth was stuffed full with this hard thing, and she could only make "wu wu" sounds from her nasal cavity, unable to speak anymore.

"What is this thing?" Zhou Wei was afraid this thing was some kind of dangerous item and asked.

Little Xu turned his head to look, also took one out and gave it to Zhou Wei, saying: "It's just Grass Field No. 7 emergency rations. When the special forces came to exchange, they said this thing is better carved into a pear shape. Carry it around normally, and when you catch a prisoner and need to shut them up, just stuff it in. It's more useful than temporarily finding other things. Our company carves these things with knives when resting normally. Basically everyone has one. I heard our company commander even submitted a report to the General Logistics, to see if future emergency rations could be made directly in this shape, saving us the trouble of carving."

"Interesting." Zhou Wei just looked at something novel and didn't delve into it. He wasn't in the mood.

That Secretary Zhou knew she couldn't say anything anymore. She could only lie on her side on the ground, crying and whimpering while trying hard to make a kowtowing gesture. Zhou Wei's heart stirred with a trace of pity again. But just as he had this thought and wanted to stand up to say something, he found that his calves still had no strength and still couldn't stand up. That just-kindled pity went with the wind. No longer caring about the "we don't do this" rhetoric, he just ignored her.
