# Chapter 32: The Oriole Society

Guangzhou's South City faced the Pearl River and was the mooring place for sea merchants and foreign vessels. By the Song dynasty, South City had become a commercial center, protected by the East and West Yanchi walls, which were destroyed during the Yuan dynasty's military turmoil. After the founding of the Ming, commerce flourished here again. But following the Tuolin mutiny, when South City residents were victimized, the authorities built new walls along the old Yanchi foundations. As the *Guangdong Gazetteer* noted: "In the forty-second year of Jiajing [1563], Governor Wu Guifang, in response to the Tuolin mutiny's trampling of residents outside the walls, constructed new walls from the southwest corner tower to Fifth Sheep Relay Station, encircling to the southeast corner tower, for defense."

With the protection of walls, the New South City—though facing the Pearl River with moats on three sides and the smallest area of Guangzhou's three walled districts—concentrated the foreign-vessel zone, wharf zone, commercial zone, and wealthy residences within its bounds, making it the city's commercial-economic heart.

At this moment, on the Pearl River embankment outside South City's Jinghai Gate, stood several men wearing rain capes and bamboo hats, apparently surveying something.

The sky was overcast and close; misty rain blurred everything. On the river, a dozen or so sailing ships lay at anchor, their black silhouettes barely visible in the thick water-fog. Gazing far toward Shicui Islet and White Goose Pool, all was lost in the deep haze, as if merged with sky and clouds.

"Damn it—where's any Australian ship?" One of them spat and cursed.

"Boss Wang, we've been searching for over ten days. We've examined every kind of sea vessel along the river—there's no strange big ship."

The one called Boss Wang didn't answer, gazing out for a long while in silence. In midstream, ripples spread in circles as old fish blew bubbles. Below the embankment, jagged rocks jutted; turbid waves slapped against them. Not far away, a foreign ship was unloading cargo; a gang of porters shouldered goods from the gangway to the wharf warehouse.

"Brother Wang, I really don't understand. The master's doing fine in Zhongzuo Garrison—why this sudden whim to send us looking for some Australian merchants? I've followed the master all these years, sailed the Eastern and Western seas—I've never heard of any such 'Australia'!"

Boss Wang snorted coldly: "What are you lot babbling about? Do you know where we are?! Want to lose your heads?"

Everyone fell silent.

After a long pause, Boss Wang said: "Australia may be a place we've never heard of, but the goods sold at the Gao family shop on Haopan Street didn't fall from the sky, did they? The whole city of Guangzhou is going mad—who doesn't know about Australian rarities? Such a profitable trade, coming by sea—how can we brothers not make a killing?" He smiled grimly. "This time, we must get to the bottom of these sea merchants."

These men were subordinates of Zheng Zhilong, the "great pirate" currently ravaging Fujian and shaking both Fujian and Guangdong provinces. At present, allied with Li Kuiqi, they had gathered over thirty thousand men and occupied a string of key coastal islands and harbors in southern Fujian—Zhongzuo, Gulangyu, Da Dan, Lieyu, Gaopu. Whether plundering merchant ships, extorting "protection water" money, or raiding inland to burn, kill, and kidnap—they had become the dominant power on Fujian's southern coast.

The group walked along the wharf toward the city, passing more and more pedestrians and peddlers. Past the Dragon King Temple, the tower of Jinghai Gate came into view. Once inside the walls, they followed the road toward the Fifth Sheep Gate. Ahead stood a magnificent temple—the Tianfei Temple, built during the Hongwu reign. This was South City's transportation hub, a cosmopolitan crossroads where all kinds of people mingled with sedan chairs and mule carts, merchants gathered, markets bustled—voices clamoring, stalls stretching on and on, a scene of thriving commerce.

Boss Wang was evidently very cautious, walking along the wall. Turning a corner, they entered an alley. At the base of the city wall was a small tavern, its dingy bamboo half-curtain hanging dark with grease. The group slipped into the shop. Inside, a few oil lamps hung; even by day it was quite dim. Customers made a noisy crowd; the floor was wet and slippery, the air thick with a strange mix of cooking smells, wine, oil smoke, and body odor.

The waiter saw customers enter and hurried to greet them. Boss Wang requested a private booth and ordered some food and wine. The curtain wasn't fully lowered—half-raised—so the man seated at the doorway could survey the entire shop.

After a while, a street-loafer type entered: a smooth-faced, middle-aged man. Their eyes met, and the newcomer came to sit with them. No pleasantries—everyone just ate and drank. Boss Wang, seeing no plainclothes constables or Depot agents in the shop, asked quietly: "Any news from the brothers on Haopan Street?"

"We've been tailing for nearly half a month. Nothing useful. We've watched load after load of goods carried out of the Gao mansion and sent to the shop—but no special goods going in, and no peculiar people."

"What the hell!" Boss Wang had no appetite for the food. He stared at a steaming, fragrant plate of stir-fried snake shreds. "How do all those goods get in there?" Could it be misdirection? Perhaps the Australian goods weren't coming from the Gao mansion at all—this was just a cover?

"What about Gao family's wharf warehouse?"

"We checked that too," the man shook his head. "The Gao shop keeps very strict rules; we couldn't pry out anything. It took the brothers many days just to learn that the warehouse manager has a mistress who's a part-time prostitute. We spent some silver and got a bit of information from her." He stopped there and took a drink.

Boss Wang knew this local rat was squeezing for money. He cursed inwardly but just said: "Silver's no problem. What did you find out?"

"The manager says Australian goods never go through the warehouse. They're all sent out from Gao Ju's private storage at his residence. Each shipment isn't much—just a few crates. But every piece is valuable." The middle-aged man's eyes gleamed with greed.

"How often do they ship?"

"No set schedule—roughly every ten days or so."

So the goods did come from the Gao residence—but how did they get in? The Gao mansion wasn't on the seashore; no ship could sail in. Did they fall from the sky?

"Have you investigated what the Gao family brings into the mansion?"

"For that, we got help from Flying-Foot Third from the porters' guild. He charged quite a bit..."

"No problem." Boss Wang said this but touched the short blade in his sleeve.

"He wanted ten taels of silver." The middle-aged man squinted at Boss Wang, testing his reaction. Boss Wang smiled dully, not answering. Glancing around at the others, all were smirking coldly. The man suddenly remembered whose subordinates sat before him. He quickly continued: "Flying-Foot Third had people secretly check what the Gao family was bringing in—and there *is* something strange!"

"Oh? The goods are being smuggled in?"

"No, no—it's what goes in and out that's odd."

They had bribed people throughout the porters' guild to secretly examine a month's worth of bulk cargo going into and out of the Gao residence. What went in used to be mainly porcelain and ironware; what came out was similar. But this month was different. Besides those, they were also bringing in musk, ambergris, red sandalwood—and strangest of all, nothing was ever shipped back out. It was as if everything vanished into the sea the moment it entered.

After all the investigation, they still couldn't determine where the goods came from. Boss Wang sighed in disappointment. If even the local rats couldn't find out, relying on themselves would be even harder.

He paid out a dozen or so foreign coins and sent the man off. The group found it all hard to believe. In the month since they'd infiltrated Guangzhou, through countless difficulties, they'd investigated up to this point. Though they roughly knew where the sea merchants were staying, where their ship was moored and how goods were transported remained mysteries. For now, they could only wait for the report from the men sent to infiltrate the Gao residence a few days earlier.

They waited a long time. Finally, the two men who had been prepared to infiltrate the Gao residence returned. One had a scrape on his face. Boss Wang saw his expression shift—he knew things had gone wrong.

"The back streets over there all have barriers—hard to enter. So we went over the city wall in a roundabout way and lay in wait for several days before spotting something odd." These two had been famous flying thieves and bandits before fleeing murder charges and wanted posters drove them to join the pirates. The Zheng family had promised them a hefty sum for this dangerous Guangzhou mission.

From the city wall, they had observed people and cargo entering and exiting the Gao mansion's back gate. They discovered everything came and went from another compound's rear courtyard. They managed to get inside for a look—and saw the Australian sea merchants.

"Four people in all. Dressed in Ming attire, but with shaved heads—like monks."

Knowing this courtyard held secrets, they observed two more days and determined it was a secret Gao property, now serving as the Australian merchants' quarters. All goods were transported from this safe house to the Gao mansion; the Gao mansion also sent goods here.

So the question circled back: they still hadn't discovered where the sea merchants' goods came from.

"We wanted to listen in on their conversation, but—damn it!" The one with the bruise spoke viciously. "There's a trained fighter among them. The moment we got close, he spotted us and threw a rock—fast and vicious."

"I say we go all in." Someone spoke in a low voice. "Just 'raid the blankets.' Grab the Gao family's Steward Yan—or even Gao Ju himself—and we'll get the whole story!"

Boss Wang snorted: "Grab them? Which merchant on Haopan Street isn't well-connected? Setting aside their reach into high places—just the household guards they keep would be enough to drink you dry."

"Then grab one of the sea merchants." The man chuckled. "Even if we don't touch the Gao family, these rootless sea merchants are no problem, right? Brother He says there's only one fighter among them, and no Gao household guards. Even if he were made of iron, how many nails could he forge? We gather a few more skilled brothers, go in, and grab one. Take him aboard our ship—then whether he's from Australia or Kunlun Mountain, he'll have to explain everything. Besides,"—he grinned greedily—"to get him back, won't they have to hand over some good stuff?"

The others roared approval, all looking at Boss Wang. Boss Wang thought this was indeed an option. Kidnapping a sea merchant wasn't a big deal; Gao Ju was unlikely to be furious over it, leaving room for future dealings.

With that thought, they huddled together and began plotting.
