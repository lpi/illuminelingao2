# Chapter 32: The Oriole Society

Guangzhou's South City faced the Pearl River and was the mooring place for sea merchants and foreign vessels. By the Song dynasty, South City had become a commercial center, protected by the East and West Yanchi walls, which were destroyed during Yuan dynasty military turmoil. After the Ming's founding, commerce flourished here again. But following the Tuolin mutiny, when South City residents were victimized, the authorities built new walls along the old Yanchi foundations. As the *Guangdong Gazetteer* noted: "In the forty-second year of Jiajing [1563], Governor Wu Guifang, in response to the Tuolin mutiny's trampling of residents outside the walls, constructed new walls from the southwest corner tower to Fifth Sheep Relay Station, encircling to the southeast corner tower, for defense."

With these walls, New South City—though facing the Pearl River with moats on three sides and the smallest of Guangzhou's three walled districts—concentrated the foreign-vessel zone, wharf zone, commercial zone, and wealthy residences within its bounds, making it the city's commercial heart.

At this moment, on the Pearl River embankment outside South City's Jinghai Gate, several men in rain capes and bamboo hats stood surveying the river.

The sky was overcast and close; misty rain blurred everything. On the river, a dozen sailing ships lay at anchor, their black silhouettes barely visible in the thick water-fog. Gazing toward Shicui Islet and White Goose Pool, all was lost in deep haze, merged with sky and clouds.

"Damn it—where's any Australian ship?" One spat and cursed.

"Boss Wang, we've searched over ten days. We've examined every sea vessel along the river—there's no strange big ship."

Boss Wang didn't answer, gazing out in silence. In midstream, ripples spread as old fish blew bubbles. Below the embankment, jagged rocks jutted; turbid waves slapped against them. Not far away, a foreign ship was unloading cargo; porters shouldered goods from the gangway to the wharf warehouse.

"Brother Wang, I don't understand. The master's doing fine in Zhongzuo Garrison—why this sudden whim to send us looking for Australian merchants? I've followed the master all these years, sailed the Eastern and Western seas—I've never heard of any 'Australia'!"

Boss Wang snorted: "What are you babbling about? Do you know where we are?! Want to lose your heads?"

Everyone fell silent.

After a pause, Boss Wang said: "Australia may be a place we've never heard of, but the goods sold at the Gao family shop on Haopan Street didn't fall from the sky, did they? The whole city is going mad—who doesn't know about Australian rarities? Such a profitable trade, coming by sea—how can we brothers not make a killing?" He smiled grimly. "This time, we must get to the bottom of these sea merchants."

These men were subordinates of Zheng Zhilong, the "great pirate" currently ravaging Fujian and shaking both Fujian and Guangdong provinces. Allied with Li Kuiqi, they had gathered over thirty thousand men and occupied key coastal islands and harbors in southern Fujian—Zhongzuo, Gulangyu, Da Dan, Lieyu, Gaopu. Whether plundering merchant ships, extorting "protection water" money, or raiding inland to burn, kill, and kidnap—they had become the dominant power on Fujian's southern coast.

The group walked along the wharf toward the city, passing more pedestrians and peddlers. Past the Dragon King Temple, Jinghai Gate's tower came into view. Inside the walls, they followed the road toward Fifth Sheep Gate. Ahead stood a magnificent temple—Tianfei Temple, built during the Hongwu reign. This was South City's transportation hub, a cosmopolitan crossroads where all kinds mingled with sedan chairs and mule carts, merchants gathered, markets bustled—voices clamoring, stalls stretching on, thriving commerce.

Boss Wang was cautious, walking along the wall. Turning a corner, they entered an alley. At the base of the city wall was a small tavern, its dingy bamboo half-curtain dark with grease. The group slipped inside. A few oil lamps hung; even by day it was dim. Customers made a noisy crowd; the floor was wet and slippery, the air thick with cooking smells, wine, oil smoke, and body odor.

The waiter hurried to greet them. Boss Wang requested a private booth and ordered food and wine. The curtain was half-raised so the man at the doorway could survey the entire shop.

After a while, a street-loafer type entered: a smooth-faced, middle-aged man. Their eyes met; the newcomer sat with them. No pleasantries—everyone just ate and drank. Boss Wang, seeing no plainclothes constables or Depot agents, asked quietly: "Any news from the brothers on Haopan Street?"

"We've been tailing nearly half a month. Nothing useful. We've watched loads of goods carried out of the Gao mansion and sent to the shop—but no special goods going in, and no peculiar people."

"What the hell!" Boss Wang had no appetite. He stared at a steaming plate of stir-fried snake shreds. "How do those goods get in there?" Could it be misdirection? Perhaps the Australian goods weren't coming from the Gao mansion at all—just a cover?

"What about Gao family's wharf warehouse?"

"Checked that too," the man shook his head. "The Gao shop keeps strict rules; we couldn't pry out anything. It took days just to learn the warehouse manager has a mistress who's a part-time prostitute. We spent silver and got a bit of information from her." He stopped and took a drink.

Boss Wang knew this local rat was squeezing for money. He cursed inwardly but said: "Silver's no problem. What did you find out?"

"The manager says Australian goods never go through the warehouse. They're all sent from Gao Ju's private storage at his residence. Each shipment isn't much—just a few crates. But every piece is valuable." The middle-aged man's eyes gleamed with greed.

"How often do they ship?"

"No set schedule—roughly every ten days."

So the goods came from the Gao residence—but how did they get in? The mansion wasn't on the seashore; no ship could sail in. Did they fall from the sky?

"Have you investigated what the Gao family brings in?"

"For that, we got help from Flying-Foot Third from the porters' guild. He charged quite a bit..."

"No problem." Boss Wang said this but touched the short blade in his sleeve.

"He wanted ten taels." The middle-aged man squinted, testing his reaction. Boss Wang smiled dully. Glancing at the others, all smirked coldly. The man suddenly remembered whose subordinates sat before him. He quickly continued: "Flying-Foot Third had people secretly check what the Gao family was bringing in—and there *is* something strange!"

"Oh? The goods are being smuggled in?"

"No—it's what goes in and out that's odd."

They had bribed people throughout the porters' guild to examine a month's worth of cargo going into and out of the Gao residence. What went in used to be mainly porcelain and ironware; what came out was similar. But this month was different. Besides those, they were bringing in musk, ambergris, red sandalwood—and strangest of all, nothing was shipped back out. Everything vanished into the sea the moment it entered.

After all the investigation, they still couldn't determine where the goods came from. Boss Wang sighed. If even the local rats couldn't find out, relying on themselves would be harder.

He paid out a dozen foreign coins and sent the man off. The group found it hard to believe. In the month since they'd infiltrated Guangzhou, through countless difficulties, they'd investigated this far. Though they roughly knew where the sea merchants stayed, where their ship moored and how goods were transported remained mysteries. For now, they could only wait for the report from the men sent to infiltrate the Gao residence days earlier.

They waited a long time. Finally, the two men prepared to infiltrate the Gao residence returned. One had a scrape on his face. Boss Wang saw his expression shift—he knew things had gone wrong.

"The back streets all have barriers—hard to enter. So we went over the city wall and lay in wait for several days before spotting something odd." These two had been famous flying thieves before murder charges and wanted posters drove them to join the pirates. The Zheng family had promised them a hefty sum for this dangerous Guangzhou mission.

From the city wall, they had observed people and cargo at the Gao mansion's back gate. They discovered everything came and went from another compound's rear courtyard. They managed to get inside—and saw the Australian sea merchants.

"Four people. Dressed in Ming attire, but with shaved heads—like monks."

Knowing this courtyard held secrets, they observed two more days and determined it was a secret Gao property, now serving as the Australian merchants' quarters. All goods were transported from this safe house to the Gao mansion; the Gao mansion also sent goods here.

The question circled back: they still hadn't discovered where the sea merchants' goods came from.

"We wanted to listen in, but—damn it!" The one with the bruise spoke viciously. "There's a trained fighter among them. The moment we got close, he spotted us and threw a rock—fast and vicious."

"I say we go all in." Someone spoke in a low voice. "Just 'raid the blankets.' Grab Steward Yan—or even Gao Ju himself—and we'll get the whole story!"

Boss Wang snorted: "Grab them? Which merchant on Haopan Street isn't well-connected? Setting aside their reach into high places—just the household guards would be enough to drink you dry."

"Then grab one of the sea merchants." The man chuckled. "Even if we don't touch the Gao family, these rootless sea merchants are no problem, right? Brother He says there's only one fighter among them, and no Gao household guards. Even if he were made of iron, how many nails could he forge? We gather skilled brothers, go in, and grab one. Take him aboard our ship—then whether he's from Australia or Kunlun Mountain, he'll have to explain everything. Besides,"—he grinned greedily—"to get him back, won't they have to hand over some good stuff?"

The others roared approval, all looking at Boss Wang. Boss Wang thought this was an option. Kidnapping a sea merchant wasn't a big deal; Gao Ju was unlikely to be furious over it, leaving room for future dealings.

With that thought, they huddled together and began plotting.
