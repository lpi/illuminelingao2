# Chapter 156: A Certain Man

Late night.

Ma Qianzhu drafted documents under lamplight:

Planning Committee 1628 Document No. 31: Regarding Military Formation Requirements, Ordnance Production, and Material Allocation.

Classification: Confidential

I. Order Ordnance-Department to immediately estimate material and manpower requirements for the following projects:

1. Begin training 500 New Army soldiers within one week. Including 30 transmigrators. Therefore immediately assemble existing Minié-rifle components into finished-weapons—estimated first-batch 350 rifles. Additionally, Ordnance-Department to provide: 5 × 6-pounder smoothbores, 4 × 12-pounder howitzers.

During training: each cannon fires 2 rounds daily; each rifle fires 10 rounds daily. Estimate ammunition-consumption; produce 6-months' training-ammunition.

2. After 6 months, expand to 1,000 troops—training-intensity unchanged. Full rifle/cannon equipment with ammunition. Active inventory: 1,000 rifles, 100 cannons (including naval-ships and land/sea fortress-guns), plus 100% reserve-stock in warehouses. Arrange personnel for weapon-repair.

3. Estimated single-battle consumption: 60 rounds per-cannon, 50 rounds per-rifle. Beyond training, stockpile minimum 2-battles' ammunition in production-plan.

4. Need 1,000 uniform-sets (with underwear) and equipment. Fabric and leather from stockpile. Need transmigrators with pattern-making or clothing-production experience. Batch-processing can be assigned to Commune-garment-factory.

5. Estimate 1,000 New Army soldiers' combat-rations.

II. Establish Military-Political Cadre School

1. Divide into Classes A and B. Class-A: local-adults with educational-foundation. Class-B: youth-class. Personnel from quarantine-cleared youth and children. Meals at transmigrator-level. Logistics-Department to specify additional grain, meat, salt requirements.

2. Construction-Department to consider school-site and estimate project-materials and labor.

III. Chemistry-Department Progress

1. Chemistry-Department to report completion-schedules for three major plants: coal-tar factory, 800-ton synthetic-ammonia plant, and salt-electrolysis plant.

2. If factory-methods unavailable, what substitute-processes can manufacture acids/bases? List required materials, equipment, and energy.

3. Report on which explosives and pyrotechnics can be scaled. Priority: black-powder, nitrocellulose, mercury-fulminate, and nitroglycerin.

IV. Trade

1. Focus on glassware. Industrial-Committee should establish Light-Industry Department for this. First-batch products: glass-mirrors, wine-bottles (Guangzhou order).

2. Guangzhou has purchased resale-tobacco. Can manufacture cigarettes. Industrial-Department to quickly develop cigarette-paper.

3. Guangzhou Forward-Station repeatedly reports insufficient transportation—purchased materials piling-up. Original plan: buy 2–3 ships locally with hired crews. But recently authorities are sealing ocean-vessels, preparing for naval-war—all shipyards stopped building. Request Executive-Committee urgently acquire 1–2 ships.

...

Ma Qianzhu wrote until deep-night. All departments' myriad-threads ultimately converged at Planning-Committee for coordination. As operations expanded, ideas and plans multiplied—originally streamlined institutions now clearly needed adjustment.

He pondered. First: Intelligence and Security departments needed integration. Current Intelligence-Department mostly searched archives—insufficient real-world collection. Long-Range Recon—limited by conditions—had only extended reconnaissance to neighboring-counties. Prefectural-capital's situation remained unclear. Recon-Team resembled resource-survey-team—often mixed with various specialists—limiting capability. Military-political intelligence was under-collected. General-Staff establishing Military-Intelligence-Department was a good-start. Future: separate Recon-Teams from Survey-Teams. As Guangzhou opened up, Leizhou intelligence-commerce system needed establishment, then penetration into Qiongzhou-Prefect-city. Other counties—Ma Qianzhu considered irrelevant. Once conflict with Ming erupted—just seize them directly. No pre-infiltration needed.

He brewed tea—captured from Gou Manor. Lingao produced no tea; in a timespace without soda, tea-demand increased greatly. Actually, soda wasn't difficult. Ma Qianzhu's childhood was in a large state-enterprise residential-compound—those enterprises managed everything from birth to death except graves. Even soda was self-made. Young Ma Qianzhu had worshipped that magical-machine. Growing-up, research revealed minimal technical-content.

"I can even make cola." Remembering Nanhai Farm's coca-trees, he murmured. Cola was just caramel, coca-extract, and soda mixed together.

"Cola? You didn't bet on that?" A man's voice came from doorway.

"With painful-lessons before, who dares bet on cola? Sit—tea?" Ma Qianzhu rose to pour water. A cadre-privilege: thermos in office. Though this aluminum-thermos was approximately Ma Qianzhu's age—red-painted "*Fengcheng*" still visible.

Visitor: early-thirties to late-thirties. Broad and heavyset. Movements seemingly-sluggish but actually-agile. Completely unremarkable face—someone you'd never remember from one-meeting.

"Rare visitor. Haven't seen you since D-Day."

Visitor impassively: "You're Executive-Committee. Why would I frequently visit? Must avoid-suspicion."

"Cut it—honestly: what's your angle with this avoidance?"

"I hear you're preparing war against Zhu Cailao?" The man changed-topic.

"Not war—preparation. Must guard against attacks. Operations have expanded—can't do without military."

"Zhu Cailao is merely a declining sunset-power. Transmigrator-group's greatest threats—" the man said, "First: Ming dynasty. Already past *lidong*; autumn-taxes collected. Guangdong Ming-forces aside—Tianqi-era depleted provincial-treasury. But Qiongzhou garrison has territorial-responsibility—will likely come once. Second: Zheng Zhilong—now pacified, made *youji*-rank—preparing to eliminate former-comrades, monopolizing southeastern sea-trade."

"Your meaning?"

"Zhu Cailao is a potential ally."

"Ally with pirates?"

"Correct." The man spoke leisurely. "Transmigrator-group's maritime-strength is weak. Fishing-boats—however formidable—only four. Without local maritime-allies, soon you'll face a choice: pay protection-fees obediently, or fight all maritime-powers. You've wanted contact with Liu Xiang—actually Zhu Cailao's forces aren't bad. He's weaker than Liu Xiang; Zheng Zhilong wants to destroy him. Besieged on all sides—easier cooperation. By the way, historically he'll be knocked-out by Zheng Zhilong at Min'an next August."

"Executive-Committee considered this. But we destroyed his fence, seized 100,000+ *liang* of goods—cooperation seems difficult."

The man smiled confidently: "Zhu Cailao's current situation—he can't demand much. You have rare-goods to offer. Give him exclusive-distribution rights—he'll agree."

Ma Qianzhu pondered. He'd considered this proposal—but felt uncertain. Rob someone's money, kill his people, now suddenly ally? Would Zhu Cailao be so agreeable?

"However disagreeable—urgent problems take priority."

"Fine, I'll try. Failed negotiations cost nothing."

"With Poland—Stalin and Hitler could shake hands." The man slowly stood, gradually walking out.

"You really won't serve on Executive-Committee?" Ma Qianzhu felt regretful. "Intelligence-Department desperately needs personnel."

"Not yet time." The man gazed at Lingao's night-sky as he left.

Ma Qianzhu had nothing more that night. Next day, he convened Executive-Committee—presenting the idea. Opinions varied. Most didn't oppose peace-talks with Zhu Cailao—after all, combat meant risking lives. Rather, they doubted feasibility, fearing excessive-concessions harming transmigrator-group's prestige and interests. After repeated-discussion, they decided to attempt it. Regardless of peace-talk outcomes—military-buildup would continue. "Speak softly, carry a big stick."

Ma Qianzhu had Dugu Qiuhun bring the captured pirate-leader currently doing labor-reform at East Gate Market's road-construction. Shortly, Dugu returned with two prisoners. They were terrified seeing short-hair leaders—thinking execution imminent. Ma Qianzhu hastily reassured them.

One leader's alias was Black-Face Dragon Shi Fourteen—a ship-captain-level boss. After capture, he'd been cooperative—confessing everything he knew. Ma Qianzhu knew from interrogation-records: this man kept faith with comrades, had some reputation among the pirates.

Ma Qianzhu said: "We are overseas-descendants of Great Song, returning to Ming dynasty. Resting at Lingao. Living peacefully with your group. Yet you attacked our people, killed our men—what justification?"

Shi Fourteen heard Ma Qianzhu's words seemed not death-threatening—secretly-pleased. He hastened to say: "A misunderstanding! We had business-relations with Gou family. Recently, Gou-family's trusted-man came weeping—his master was murdered without reason by you, claiming you commit murder and robbery. Hearing this injustice, I rashly took initiative—unrelated to our Great-Boss. Now clearly that scoundrel was spreading rumors. When I return, I'll slice him to pieces to vent my fury."

This "Gou-family trusted-man weeping" story was naturally fabricated—but Black-Face Dragon just wanted to deflect-blame by agreeing with Ma Qianzhu.

Ma Qianzhu heard "murder and robbery" and secretly-laughed: you dare accuse us? But he said: "So it was a misunderstanding. Let me prepare modest-gifts as apology, then escort you home. Your three ships all sank—perhaps we should buy a small-boat to send you?"

Shi Fourteen heard he could leave—felt days like years. Fu Youdi's torments weren't gentle—they'd barely eaten, received countless beatings. He'd happily left immediately: "Since it's a misunderstanding—I also wronged your group—let's skip gifts. I'm healthy—without boats, walking works, fishing-boats work. Family has urgent-business—can't delay."

Ma Qianzhu smiled slightly: "Brother, don't rush. We've long heard Great-Boss Zhu's reputation—generous, righteous. Always wanted to pay respects. Let me prepare substantial-gifts for the Great-Boss. Please introduce me—don't refuse. Please wait momentarily—I'll return shortly." He signaled Dugu Qiuhun to watch this man, then went to report to Executive-Committee.

Executive-Committee prepared gifts for Zhu Cailao as goodwill-gesture—seeking maritime-trade cooperation. Initially they prepared plastic-flowers and glass-crafts. Nearby guard Hu Hou advised: "Flashing wealth to bandits invites wolves—endless trouble." Everyone agreed—prepared only common-items: 2 glass-mirrors, 10 bolts of silk. Also gave Shi Fourteen 10 *liang* silver as consolation.

Ma Qianzhu remembered glass-sales—told Industrial-Department to prepare samples. Zhan Wuya spread his hands: "My report's been submitted for days—furnace still not built. Where do I get samples? Just break off a piece from the Holy-Ship."

Ma Qianzhu had someone retrieve a large shard from the Holy-Ship, gave it to Shi Fourteen: "We manufacture this. Please tell Great-Boss—see if he'll distribute for us. Everything's negotiable." Shi Fourteen only wanted to board ship quickly—agreed repeatedly.
