# Chapter 162: Winning Hearts and Minds (Part 1)

The New Army had been in training for half a month. Ma Qianzhu noticed that Wei Aiwen showed no sign of starting political training and became anxious. "Little Wei, when will you start the political training? You've been with your company for two weeks. The other companies have already started. You're the Training Battalion's demonstration company—you need to lead by example!"

Wei Aiwen smiled confidently. "Chief of Staff Ma, relax! Tonight we're holding a meeting. Satisfaction guaranteed!"

"Really? You'd better do it well!" Ma Qianzhu was skeptical but didn't press further.

Actually, Wei Aiwen hadn't been idle. To ensure good results, he had racked his brains. Besides integrating deeply with the company and understanding the soldiers' situations, he had done "reconnaissance" by observing the political training of other companies. He found that political training mostly consisted of dry lectures—leaders' speeches, political reports—classes, and heavy-handed literacy campaigns. Wei Aiwen had a sudden inspiration: why not try some "retro-innovation"?

Darkness fell, and stars sparkled on the canopy of the night. Unlike in 21st-century cities, where streetlights and home lights washed out the sky so that only the brightest stars were visible, here there was no light pollution and no smog. The camp had no lights because nobody dared waste precious electricity. There was little to do, and the farmers slept early. Complete darkness covered everything. A half-moon rising in the east cast a silver radiance. Overhead, the Milky Way stretched from east to west as a brilliant band. Countless stars clustered densely—especially in the Milky Way—with a visible three-dimensional depth. Wei Aiwen gazed up, star-struck. City-raised kids had never seen such sights!

The recruits had assembled, shivering in an open-air circle. Lingao's subtropical climate kept the winter temperature above 20°C, so bonfires were too warm. A single kerosene lamp sat in the center. A red flame danced on the cotton wick, sending up gray-black smoke that blackened the brass handle.

The firelight reflected on the soldiers' faces. Everyone was curious about the "political training" notice from the new company commander, "Chief" Wei—what would the content be?

Wei Aiwen stood and surveyed his surroundings. "Everyone has gathered here for political training, a themed company meeting. The theme is: 'Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow.' Please speak honestly and freely—discuss your past experiences, your current situations, and imagine your futures."

Everyone exchanged glances—what was this? Nobody knew what to do. Nobody spoke. The atmosphere was suddenly cold and very quiet.

Wei Aiwen had anticipated this. New things needed an acceptance process. He began, "I'll start then." Wei Aiwen had a plan: he would use this opportunity to fabricate a tragic past. Sharing such a story would help break down the barriers between him and the soldiers.

"Let me sing first!" Wei Aiwen tilted his head slightly, gazing at the eastern moon. He took a deep breath, gathered his emotions, and softly sang:

*Stars fill the sky, the crescent moon gleaming bright.*
*Our company holds a meeting—pouring out our plight.*
*The evil landlord owes the poor a debt of blood,*
*Countless threads of sorrow surge like a flood.*
*Endless bitter tears hang heavy in the heart,*
*Never forget that year—when the north wind tore us apart.*
*The landlord invaded my home—thugs in a gang,*
*Said we owed him debts—with a cruel fang.*
*The landlord collecting debts—like a living King of Hell,*
*Never forget that year—when father fell ill.*
*Landlord forced labor—he coughed up blood,*
*Skin and bones thin—face like yellow mud.*
*Black-hearted landlord killed my parents dear,*
*Never forget that year—endless suffering and fear.*
*Desperate, I entered the tiger's den—herding his cattle,*
*Rising at midnight—fighting a losing battle.*
*Pitiful orphan—where to cry?*

His low voice, with its crying inflection and trembling notes, sounded like a truly plaintive wail. The soldiers felt a resonance with it. Some, remembering their own pasts, had eyes that reddened. Some softly sobbed.

Wei Aiwen himself felt a spiritual shock. This scene, this mood—it filled him with a suppressed heaviness. Originally, finding this song online, he had thought the lyrics amusing and had learned to sing it for fun. He hadn't expected it to be so powerful now. Singing it back then, he hadn't felt the bleakness, bitterness, and resentment. Seeing the reactions, he thought, *These brothers have learned their Mandarin well.*

Someone grasped Wei Aiwen's hand—it was fellow transmigrator Wang Tao. A northerner, tall and imposing, he stood out among the shorter natives. He was a former corporate trainer—an excellent storyteller and bullshitter. He had been deliberately placed in the ranks to help coordinate exactly this kind of thing. He whispered, "Captain, don't be sad. Our company is your family. Everyone here is your brother, your family."

Wang Tao choked up and couldn't continue. He sniffled, then began his tale: "My family had about ten *mu* of land. It was good land—the harvest was enough for a family of four for a year. That Zhang-*juren* coveted our land—he insisted on buying it. My father absolutely refused. That was the whole family's lifeline! So the landlord constantly sought opportunities to seize it. One year, our ox escaped and nibbled grass in the landlord's graveyard. The landlord claimed it ruined the *feng shui*. He had my father arrested and severely beaten. Father was old—he couldn't withstand it. He was carried home, and three days later—" Wang Tao's throat seemed blocked, and he couldn't continue. His expression was sorrowful, his eyes seemingly tearing up. After a long pause, he recovered. "Mother was already frail. With this shock—within days, she followed father!" Finally, he broke—tears rolled down his soot-stained cheeks. Wei Aiwen stared, amazed: *Brother, are you from the Beijing Film Academy or the Central Drama Academy?*

"Shortly after, our house caught fire. They accused me of arson—wanted me arrested for trial. Poor families can't win lawsuits against landlords! Panicked, we fled overnight. Reaching the county seat, I later sent someone to check on our home. Found our land seized by Zhang-*juren*. My little sister was captured—made a servant. He called it compensation for his losses. Later, she was sold to some unknown place. My little sister, she..." Wang Tao sobbed uncontrollably.

*Brilliant!* Watching Wang Tao's performance, Wei Aiwen secretly admired him.

A young soldier couldn't hold back. "Absolutely unconscionable!"

"I worked for local Chen Yunkai as a farmhand—herding ducks. That black-hearted bastard! When a weasel snatched one duckling, he whipped me hard and then recorded into his ledger the loss of an adult duck. Normally I ate his family's leftovers and spoiled food—I was never full—yet he recorded good meals. When it was cold, if I got sick and couldn't work, he pretended generosity by giving me worn rags—then recorded the price of new clothes. Sometimes, sick with fever and clenching my teeth, I still herded—but he recorded sick absences! At year-end, he showed the accounts—I actually owed him! I argued, but he ignored me. I cried bitterly, and he offered fake sympathy: 'Can't bear leaving me? Keep working next year.' Infuriating!" The young soldier gritted his teeth, his eyes reflecting the lamplight like shooting flames.

With that opening, the soldiers unleashed their pent-up emotions—standing up and pouring forth their bitterness. Each story outdid the last in misery.

"I'm from a military household. My ancestors were of *xiaoqi* rank. But for generations, we were just the officers' unpaid servants! Forget brotherhood—slow work meant being beaten half-dead. Those beaten to death were just dragged out—nobody asked, nobody dared ask. Outside, one death meant an official report. Inside the garrison, we were the same as dead dogs. People say county magistrates are black, but the darkness of the garrison is countless times worse!"

Wei Aiwen knew he was from a military household. Wanting to reduce the soldiers' fear of regular troops, he deliberately asked, "Wasn't combat dangerous?"

"Combat?" The military household soldier smiled bitterly. "Us military households—with pants showing our buttocks—fight who? We're worse off than commoners. When provincial commanders recruit, commoners get settlement money and grain. For military households, everything is stolen by the *baihu* and *qianhu* commanders. Joining the garrison just means eating meals. Non-favorites, not even relatives—some starve to death." He spat. "Only fools die for officials!"

Gaining momentum, he continued, "Regular troops—'official' sounds nice—but they're worse than bandits. They terrorize commoners worse than anyone. When fighting, they are more cowardly than anyone."

"Right, right—I fled from the north." Wang Tao quickly added fuel to the fire. "I heard that in Liaodong, thousands couldn't defeat a few hundred Tartars. Worst of all: a dozen Tartars chased hundreds of regulars—escapees literally died from exhaustion. Under these conditions, what's the point of fighting? One kinsman couldn't survive anymore—he joined the Liao garrison. Don't know if he's alive or dead." He wiped his tears.

"Sigh—every family is the same. If officials didn't push so hard, forcing poor people to desperation, who'd risk this? Our family traveled thousands of *li* to Qiongzhou. We thought wasteland was plentiful—we could scrape by. Didn't know farming here was harder—no irrigation, buying landlord's water. Suffering countless times worse than in the homeland! Living deaths for the whole family—now I'm alone!"

"These masters here are good." Wang Tao exploited the opportunity. "I fled here as a laborer—well-fed, well-clothed. The Masters even pay wages. The commune's best workers live in multi-story buildings!"

"Buildings? Like the short-hair masters' brick buildings? Nonsense." Someone doubted.

"Nonsense? Come with me to the Commune tomorrow!"

"If it's really true—I don't need buildings. Just a leak-proof shack—I'd be satisfied." One recruit spoke wistfully.

"It's true." A commune-enlisted soldier confirmed. "But you need worker status. That's why I enlisted—soldiers become workers."

"Also get private plots for farming." The commune soldiers especially valued plots.

"Can we have these too?" Someone timidly asked.
