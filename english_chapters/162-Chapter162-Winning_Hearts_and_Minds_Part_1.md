# Chapter 162: Winning Hearts and Minds (Part 1)

New Army had trained for half-a-month. Ma Qianzhu saw Wei Aiwen showing no-sign of starting political-training—got anxious: "Little Wei, when will you do political-training? You've been with your company two-weeks. Other companies already-started. You're the Training-Battalion's reference-company—lead by example!"

Wei Aiwen smiled confidently: "Chief-of-Staff Ma, relax! Tonight we hold meeting. Guaranteed satisfaction!"

"Really? You better do it well!" Ma Qianzhu was half-skeptical—didn't press further.

Actually, Wei Aiwen hadn't been idle. For good-work, he'd racked-brains. Besides integrating deeply with company understanding soldiers' situations, he'd done "reconnaissance"—observing other-companies' political-training. He found political-training was: lectures (leaders' speeches, political-reports), classes, literacy-campaigns... Wei Aiwen had brainstorm: why not try retro-innovation?

Darkness fell. Stars sparkled on night-canopy. Here—unlike 21st-century cities with streetlights and home-lights washing sky-white, only brightest-stars visible—no smog either. Camp had no-lights—nobody wasted precious-electricity. Nothing to do except watch-AVs. Farmers slept early. Complete-darkness everywhere. Half-moon rising east—silver radiance. Overhead, east-west Milky-Way was brilliant-band. Countless-stars clustered densely—mostly in Milky-Way—three-dimensional depth visible. Wei Aiwen gazed star-struck. City-raised kids never saw such sights!

Recruits had assembled—shivering in open-air circle. Lingao's subtropical-climate kept winter above 20°C—bonfires were too-warm. Just one kerosene-lamp in center. Red-flame danced on cotton-wick; gray-black smoke rose; brass-handle grew ever-shinier-black.

Firelight reflected on soldiers' faces. Everyone curious—tonight's "political-training" notice from new-company-commander "Chief"—what content?

Wei Aiwen stood, surveyed surroundings: "Everyone gathered here for political-training, themed-company-meeting. Theme: Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow. Please speak honestly, freely—discuss past-experiences, current-situations, imagine futures."

Everyone exchanged-glances—what was this? Nobody knew what to do. Nobody spoke. Atmosphere suddenly-cold, very-quiet.

Wei Aiwen anticipated this. New-things need acceptance-processes. He began: "I'll start then." Wei Aiwen had planned: using this opportunity, fabricate past-experiences. Spread the story to eliminate soldier-barriers.

"Let me sing first!" Wei Aiwen slightly-tilted head, gazing at eastern-moon. Deep-breath, gathered-emotion, softly-sang:

"Stars fill sky, crescent-moon gleaming bright. Our company holds meeting—pouring-out grievances. Evil-landlord owes poor-people blood-debt. Countless-threads, countless-threads surge to heart. Endless bitter-tears hang in heart. Never forget that year—north-wind piercing bone. Landlord invaded my home—thugs in gang. Said we owed him debts—owed him grain. Landlord collecting debts—like living King-of-Hell. Never forget that year—father sick in bed. Landlord forced labor—coughed-up blood. Skin-and-bones thin—face sickly-yellow. Blackheart-landlord killed my parents. Never forget that year—endless suffering. Desperate, entered tiger-den—herding landlord's cattle. Rising midnight—returning sunset. Pitiful orphan—where to cry?"

Low-voice with crying-inflection, trembling-singing—truly plaintive-wailing. Soldiers felt resonance. Some remembering their-pasts, eyes-reddened. Some softly-sobbed.

Wei Aiwen himself felt spiritual-shock. This scene, this mood—filled him with suppressed-heaviness. Originally, finding this song online, he'd thought lyrics amusing, learned to sing. Didn't expect it'd be useful now. Singing then—he hadn't felt the bleakness, bitterness, resentment. Seeing reactions—these brothers had learned their Mandarin well.

Someone grasped Wei Aiwen's hand—fellow-transmigrator Wang Tao. Northerner, tall-and-big, standing imposingly among short-natives. Former corporate-trainer—excellent storyteller-bullshitter. Deliberately placed in ranks for coordination. He whispered: "Captain, don't be sad. Our company is your family. Everyone are your brothers, your family."

Wang Tao choked-up, couldn't continue. Sniffled, then began his tale: "My family had about 10-*mu* land. Good-land—harvest enough for four-person-family for a year. That Zhang-*juren* coveted our land—insisted on buying. My father absolutely-refused. That was whole-family's lifeline! So landlord constantly-sought opportunities to seize it. One-year, our ox escaped—nibbled grass in landlord's graveyard. Landlord claimed ruined-fengshui. Had father arrested, severely-beaten. Father was old—couldn't withstand. Carried-home, three-days later—" Wang Tao's throat seemed-blocked, couldn't continue. Sorrowful-expression, eyes seemingly-tearing. Long-pause before recovery. "Mother was already-frail. This shock—within days, followed father!" Finally-broke—tears rolled down blackened-cheeks. Wei Aiwen stared-amazed: Brother, are you from Beijing-Film or Central-Drama Academy?

"Shortly-after, their-house caught fire. Accused me of arson—wanted me arrested for trial. Poor-families can't out-litigate landlords! Panicked—fled overnight. Reaching county-seat, later sent-someone checking home. Found our-land seized by Zhang-*juren*. My little-sister captured—made servant. Called compensation for his-losses. Later—sold somewhere unknown. My little sister, she..." Wang Tao sobbed-uncontrollably.

Brilliant! Watching Wang Tao's performance—Wei Aiwen secretly-admired.

A young-soldier couldn't-hold-back: "Absolutely unconscionable!"

"I worked for local Chen-Yunkai as farmhand—herding ducks. That blackheart-bastard! One duckling was snatched by weasel—he whipped me hard, then recorded losing one adult-duck. Normally I ate his-family's leftovers and spoiled-food—never full—yet he recorded good-meals. When cold, if I got-sick I couldn't work—he pretended-generosity giving worn-rags—then recorded new-clothes. Sometimes sick with fever, clenching-teeth I still herded—he recorded sick-absences! Year-end, he showed accounts—I actually owed him! I argued—he ignored. I cried-bitterly—he fake-sympathized: 'Can't bear leaving me? Keep working next-year.' Infuriating!" Young-soldier gritted-teeth, eyes reflecting lamplight like shooting-flames.

With opening, soldiers unleashed—standing-up, pouring-forth bitterness. Each outdoing others.

"I'm military-household. Ancestors were *xiaoqi*-rank. But generations just were officers' unpaid-servants! Forget brotherhood—slow-work meant beaten-half-dead. Beaten-to-death just dragged-out—nobody asked, nobody dared-ask. Outside, one-death meant official-report. Inside garrison—same as dead-dogs. People say county-magistrates are black—garrison's darkness is countless-times worse!"

Wei Aiwen knew he was military-household. Wanting to reduce soldiers' fear of regular-troops, he deliberately-asked: "Wasn't combat dangerous?"

"Combat?" Military-household smiled-bitterly. "Us military-households—pants showing-buttocks—fight who? We're worse than commoners. Provincial-commander recruits—commoners get settling-money/grain. Military-households—everything stolen by *baihu*/*qianhu*. Joining-garrison means eating-meals. Non-favorites not even relatives—some starve-to-death." He spat. "Only fools die for officials!"

Getting momentum: "Regular-troops—'official' sounds nice—worse than bandits. Terrorizing commoners worse than anyone. Fighting—more cowardly than anyone."

"Right right—I fled from north." Wang Tao quickly-poisoned: "Heard Liaodong fought Tartars—thousands couldn't defeat few-hundred Tartars. Worst: dozen-Tartars chased hundreds of regulars—escapees literally-died from exhaustion. Like this—what's the point of fighting? One kinsman couldn't survive anymore—joined Liao-garrison. Don't know if alive or dead." Wiped-tears.

"Sigh—every-family the same. If officials didn't push so-hard, forcing poor-people to desperation, who'd risk this? Our-family traveled thousands-of-*li* to Qiongzhou. Thought wasteland was plentiful—could scrape-by. Didn't know farming here was harder—no irrigation, buying landlord's water. Suffering countless-times worse than homeland! Living-deaths for whole-family—now I'm alone!"

"These masters here are good." Wang Tao exploited-opportunity: "I fled here as laborer—well-fed, well-clothed. Masters even pay wages. Commune's best-workers live in multi-story buildings!"

"Buildings? Like short-hair-masters' brick-buildings? Nonsense." Someone doubted.

"Nonsense? Come with me to Commune tomorrow!"

"If really-true—I don't need buildings. Just a leak-proof shack—I'd be satisfied." One recruit spoke-wistfully.

"It's true." A Commune-enlisted soldier: "But need worker-status. That's why I enlisted—soldiers become workers."

"Also get private-plots for farming." Commune-soldiers especially-valued plots.

"Can we have these too?" Someone timidly-asked.
