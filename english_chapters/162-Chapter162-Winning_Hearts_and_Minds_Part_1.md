# Chapter 162: Winning Hearts and Minds (Part 1)

The New Army had trained for half a month. Ma Qianzhu saw Wei Aiwen showing no sign of starting political training and got anxious: "Little Wei, when will you do political training? You've been with your company two weeks. Other companies already started. You're the Training Battalion's reference company—lead by example!"

Wei Aiwen smiled confidently: "Chief of Staff Ma, relax! Tonight we hold a meeting. Guaranteed satisfaction!"

"Really? You better do it well!" Ma Qianzhu was half-skeptical but didn't press further.

Actually, Wei Aiwen hadn't been idle. For good results, he'd racked his brains. Besides integrating deeply with the company and understanding soldiers' situations, he'd done "reconnaissance"—observing other companies' political training. He found that political training consisted of lectures (leaders' speeches, political reports), classes, literacy campaigns... Wei Aiwen had a brainstorm: why not try retro-innovation?

Darkness fell. Stars sparkled on the night canopy. Here—unlike 21st-century cities with streetlights and home lights washing the sky white, only the brightest stars visible—there was no smog either. Camp had no lights because nobody wasted precious electricity. There was nothing to do except watch AVs. Farmers slept early. Complete darkness was everywhere. The half-moon rising in the east cast silver radiance. Overhead, an east-west Milky Way was a brilliant band. Countless stars clustered densely—mostly in the Milky Way—with three-dimensional depth visible. Wei Aiwen gazed star-struck. City-raised kids never saw such sights!

Recruits had assembled, shivering in an open-air circle. Lingao's subtropical climate kept winter above 20°C—bonfires were too warm. Just one kerosene lamp sat in the center. A red flame danced on the cotton wick; gray-black smoke rose; the brass handle grew ever shinier-black.

Firelight reflected on soldiers' faces. Everyone was curious—tonight's "political training" notice from the new company commander "Chief"—what content?

Wei Aiwen stood and surveyed his surroundings: "Everyone gathered here for political training, a themed company meeting. Theme: Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow. Please speak honestly, freely—discuss past experiences, current situations, imagine futures."

Everyone exchanged glances—what was this? Nobody knew what to do. Nobody spoke. The atmosphere was suddenly cold, very quiet.

Wei Aiwen had anticipated this. New things needed acceptance processes. He began: "I'll start then." Wei Aiwen had planned: using this opportunity, he'd fabricate past experiences. Spreading the story would eliminate soldier barriers.

"Let me sing first!" Wei Aiwen slightly tilted his head, gazing at the eastern moon. He took a deep breath, gathered emotion, and softly sang:

"Stars fill sky, crescent moon gleaming bright. Our company holds meeting—pouring out grievances. Evil landlord owes poor people blood debt. Countless threads, countless threads surge to heart. Endless bitter tears hang in heart. Never forget that year—north wind piercing bone. Landlord invaded my home—thugs in gang. Said we owed him debts—owed him grain. Landlord collecting debts—like living King of Hell. Never forget that year—father sick in bed. Landlord forced labor—coughed up blood. Skin and bones thin—face sickly yellow. Blackheart landlord killed my parents. Never forget that year—endless suffering. Desperate, entered tiger's den—herding landlord's cattle. Rising midnight—returning sunset. Pitiful orphan—where to cry?"

His low voice with crying inflection, his trembling singing—it was truly plaintive wailing. Soldiers felt resonance. Some, remembering their pasts, had eyes that reddened. Some softly sobbed.

Wei Aiwen himself felt spiritual shock. This scene, this mood—it filled him with suppressed heaviness. Originally, finding this song online, he'd thought the lyrics amusing and had learned to sing. He hadn't expected it'd be useful now. Singing then, he hadn't felt the bleakness, bitterness, resentment. Seeing reactions, he thought: these brothers had learned their Mandarin well.

Someone grasped Wei Aiwen's hand—fellow transmigrator Wang Tao. A northerner, tall and big, he stood imposingly among short natives. He was a former corporate trainer—an excellent storyteller and bullshitter. He'd been deliberately placed in the ranks for coordination. He whispered: "Captain, don't be sad. Our company is your family. Everyone are your brothers, your family."

Wang Tao choked up and couldn't continue. He sniffled, then began his tale: "My family had about 10-*mu* land. Good land—harvest enough for a four-person family for a year. That Zhang-*juren* coveted our land—insisted on buying. My father absolutely refused. That was the whole family's lifeline! So the landlord constantly sought opportunities to seize it. One year, our ox escaped—nibbled grass in the landlord's graveyard. The landlord claimed ruined fengshui. Had father arrested, severely beaten. Father was old—couldn't withstand. Carried home, three days later—" Wang Tao's throat seemed blocked, and he couldn't continue. His expression was sorrowful, his eyes seemingly tearing. After a long pause he recovered. "Mother was already frail. This shock—within days, followed father!" Finally he broke—tears rolled down blackened cheeks. Wei Aiwen stared amazed: *Brother, are you from Beijing Film or Central Drama Academy?*

"Shortly after, their house caught fire. Accused me of arson—wanted me arrested for trial. Poor families can't out-litigate landlords! Panicked—fled overnight. Reaching the county seat, later sent someone to check home. Found our land seized by Zhang-*juren*. My little sister captured—made servant. Called compensation for his losses. Later—sold somewhere unknown. My little sister, she..." Wang Tao sobbed uncontrollably.

*Brilliant!* Watching Wang Tao's performance, Wei Aiwen secretly admired.

A young soldier couldn't hold back: "Absolutely unconscionable!"

"I worked for local Chen Yunkai as farmhand—herding ducks. That blackheart bastard! One duckling was snatched by a weasel—he whipped me hard, then recorded losing one adult duck. Normally I ate his family's leftovers and spoiled food—never full—yet he recorded good meals. When cold, if I got sick I couldn't work—he pretended generosity giving worn rags—then recorded new clothes. Sometimes sick with fever, clenching teeth I still herded—he recorded sick absences! Year-end, he showed accounts—I actually owed him! I argued—he ignored. I cried bitterly—he fake-sympathized: 'Can't bear leaving me? Keep working next year.' Infuriating!" The young soldier gritted his teeth, his eyes reflecting lamplight like shooting flames.

With the opening, soldiers unleashed—standing up, pouring forth bitterness. Each outdid the other.

"I'm a military household. Ancestors were *xiaoqi* rank. But for generations we just were officers' unpaid servants! Forget brotherhood—slow work meant beaten half-dead. Beaten to death just dragged out—nobody asked, nobody dared ask. Outside, one death meant an official report. Inside the garrison—same as dead dogs. People say county magistrates are black—garrison's darkness is countless times worse!"

Wei Aiwen knew he was a military household. Wanting to reduce soldiers' fear of regular troops, he deliberately asked: "Wasn't combat dangerous?"

"Combat?" The military household smiled bitterly. "Us military households—pants showing buttocks—fight who? We're worse than commoners. Provincial commanders recruit—commoners get settling money and grain. Military households—everything stolen by *baihu* and *qianhu*. Joining garrison means eating meals. Non-favorites not even relatives—some starve to death." He spat. "Only fools die for officials!"

Getting momentum: "Regular troops—'official' sounds nice—worse than bandits. Terrorizing commoners worse than anyone. Fighting—more cowardly than anyone."

"Right right—I fled from the north." Wang Tao quickly poisoned the well: "Heard Liaodong fought Tartars—thousands couldn't defeat a few hundred Tartars. Worst: a dozen Tartars chased hundreds of regulars—escapees literally died from exhaustion. Like this—what's the point of fighting? One kinsman couldn't survive anymore—joined Liao garrison. Don't know if alive or dead." He wiped tears.

"Sigh—every family the same. If officials didn't push so hard, forcing poor people to desperation, who'd risk this? Our family traveled thousands of *li* to Qiongzhou. Thought wasteland was plentiful—could scrape by. Didn't know farming here was harder—no irrigation, buying landlord's water. Suffering countless times worse than homeland! Living deaths for the whole family—now I'm alone!"

"These masters here are good." Wang Tao exploited the opportunity: "I fled here as a laborer—well-fed, well-clothed. Masters even pay wages. The commune's best workers live in multi-story buildings!"

"Buildings? Like short-hair masters' brick buildings? Nonsense." Someone doubted.

"Nonsense? Come with me to the Commune tomorrow!"

"If really true—I don't need buildings. Just a leak-proof shack—I'd be satisfied." One recruit spoke wistfully.

"It's true." A commune-enlisted soldier confirmed: "But need worker status. That's why I enlisted—soldiers become workers."

"Also get private plots for farming." The commune soldiers especially valued plots.

"Can we have these too?" Someone timidly asked.
