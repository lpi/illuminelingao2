# Chapter 1348 Etiquette

He had not failed to consider the consequences. Perhaps the Later Jin side would fly into a rage out of humiliation and behead him to establish their authority, or they might simply drive him back if he didn't kowtow. However, after analyzing it repeatedly with the people in the Great Library, he believed the possibility was not very high. The Later Jin had not yet established the concept of the absolute supremacy of imperial power. Huang Taiji's sitting alone facing south had just been implemented in 1633, so the Emperor's "face" issue was far less significant than it would be later.

Furthermore, the current Huang Taiji was "thirsting for talent". In order to win over Lamaism, when the envoy of the Living Buddha of Tibet arrived, Huang Taiji also gave him extremely high courteous reception. In the old timeline, when Kong Youde and Shang Kexi surrendered, he personally went out of the city for ten li to welcome them and even performed the "hugging courtesy". It can be seen that he was a monarch who was very willing to use ultra-high specifications of courteous reception to recruit hearts.

The last point was that at this moment, the Manchus had not yet usurped the Divine Land. The Khan of Heaven's Mandate could not say things like "possessing the four seas". On the contrary, he was very eager for trade.

Combining these three points, the possibility of Huang Taiji killing or expelling Huang Hua for not kowtowing was extremely small. The possibility of successfully making the deal was very high.

Having said that, Huang Hua's mood was also very depressed—what he had to face was the biggest BUG in East Asia of this era, Huang Taiji, whose existence suspected of being a solo transmigrator. The psychological pressure could be imagined.

Huang Hua was a daring man. He started as a small merchant doing border trade in the Northeast. Without considerable courage and insight, he couldn't survive in this industry at all. But now he had to face the strongman of this time and space.

Apart from the advantage of hundreds of years of knowledge, compared with a formidable person like Huang Taiji, he was really like dust. If not for the Senate and the entire industrial system of Lingao behind him, he would probably have pissed his pants in fear long ago.

Looking forward from the horse's head, although it was still freezing cold, the color of spring had arrived slightly. River ice began to melt, the soil became moist, wild grass in the sunny places by the roadside began to wake up and send out tender buds, and willows everywhere also bore yellow buds on their soft and fine branches. Huang Hua took a deep breath. The road ahead was long, and he didn't know whether this trip would be auspicious or ominous.

The group walked for seven or eight days. Relay stations along the way tried their best to supply them, and the common people along the way avoided them when they saw this procession. On this day, the team came to the Hun River, not far from Shenyang. The welcome from Manchu and Han officials such as Sahalian of the Ministry of Rites sent by Huang Taiji was not only solemn in ceremony but also included bestowed banquets and gifts. Huang Hua stuck to his own rules. Whether it was a bestowed banquet or a reward, he bowed to the direction of Shengjing to express thanks, but absolutely did not perform the kneeling and kowtowing ceremony. Sahalian and others did not think it strange.

That night, the group stayed at the Hun River Relay Station. Sahalian came to visit in person—because they would enter the city tomorrow, the etiquette of both sides during the audience must be agreed upon. Sure enough, the etiquette of meeting the Khan of Heaven's Mandate became the focus of discussion between the two sides.

The Later Jin side naturally hoped that this "Great Australia" from unknown parts would meet according to the etiquette of foreign vassals: such as the Mongol tribes and Joseon. The Khan of Heaven's Mandate could give special courteous reception—such as giving Huang Hua the "hugging courtesy". But Huang Hua gritted his teeth and refused to let go, saying that he was only willing to perform a three-bow ceremony. Apart from that, let alone kowtowing, even half-kneeling or the most commonly used "dadian" (bending one knee) ceremony of the Later Jin would not do.

According to the news reporting mode of the old timeline, the two sides conducted repeated consultations focusing on this issue. Seeing that Huang Hua refused to relent, Sahalian dared not make the decision on his own, so he had to send someone to ask Huang Taiji himself to decide.

Huang Taiji himself was also a bit hesitant about this. He was originally prepared to give "Great Australia" special courteous reception—a few days ago, the Ministry of Rites officials who went ahead had already sent a few "gifts" from the Great Australian envoy by fast horse. Although things like crystal mirrors amazed him, what moved his heart more was a suit of full-body armor.

This suit of full-body armor was not only tightly protected but also allowed free movement of joints. He chose the strongest archer among his White Armored Bayara to test fire, and the protective effect was surprisingly good—better than the carefully crafted double armor worn by the Bayara. The key was that the flexibility wearing this armor was much better than double armor, the soldiers' burden was also small, and they were not easily fatigued on the battlefield.

If all Bayara could wear such armor, wouldn't it be adding wings to a tiger!

So he was quite eager to see the envoy as soon as possible to clarify the other party's purpose and "asking price".

Now hearing the Ministry of Rites report that the other party was unwilling to perform the kneeling and kowtowing ceremony, he couldn't help but hesitate.

As for empty ceremonies, he didn't originally value them much, but he was quite influenced by some Han officials, believing that as the supreme ruler, he must have considerable ceremonial honor, otherwise it would cause subordinates, princes, and foreign vassals to be disrespectful. He had been concentrating royal power all these years and attached great importance to authority, so he dared not make a decision easily.

But he didn't want to miss this excellent opportunity. Under hesitation, he decided to consult Fan Wencheng's opinion. So he called him into the Qingning Palace overnight.

After hearing that the other party strictly refused to perform the kneeling and kowtowing ceremony, Fan Wencheng thought for a moment. He knew about "Great Australia" coming to pay tribute from the beginning. He was a veteran of two reigns, having served Nurhaci like a dog and horse in his youth. Having experienced ups and downs for many years, he had long figured out the minds of the Eight Banners nobles and Gioros clearly.

He knew the Khan of Heaven's Mandate's character and style very well, knowing that he valued the goods brought by this group of people very much, and at the same time urgently wanted to open a new trade route to alleviate the current desperate situation of lack of national expenditure. Therefore, he couldn't bear to reject the other party just like this.

As a high official of the imperial court, he certainly knew what state the economy of "Great Jin" was in right now—even though he was a respected Grand Secretary, he still had to eat barnyard grass rice from time to time on weekdays, and could only "receive a reward" of some rice when the Li Dynasty paid tribute. Daily necessities on the market were all lacking, even the paper for various ministries' official business was not enough, so that official documents could only be written on the back of old files and waste paper left by the Ming Dynasty. If Great Australia could supply various goods, it would be no small help to the situation.

Huang Taiji asked: "The envoy refuses both soft and hard tactics, just refusing to kowtow to Us—would kowtowing to Us make them lose a piece of meat?"

Fan Wencheng said: "The Great Australian envoy refusing to perform the ceremony is certainly arrogant, but they are after all people from overseas, frogs in the well, not knowing the majesty of the Great Khan."

Huang Taiji asked: "In your opinion, Minister, should we make them see the majesty of the Great Khan?"

Fan Wencheng said: "Your Majesty, in this subject's view, Great Australia is a distant country overseas. Since they are willing to sail thousands of miles to pay tribute, it shows their heart of admiring the Imperial Court. There is no harm to the great principle."

Huang Taiji smiled and said: "So you think we can allow them not to perform the kneeling and kowtowing ceremony?"

"This subject believes: show them majesty, cherish them with grace."

Huang Taiji laughed loudly and said: "Good, this is well said!" Thinking about it, he said again: "In that case, give them this grace!"

"The Emperor's breadth of mind is like the sea."

Fan Wencheng knew his speculation was completely accurate. Since this was the case, he had another move to suit his fancy. He immediately proposed that since they were allowed not to use the kneeling and kowtowing ceremony, it would be inconvenient to hold an audience ceremony in the palace. It would be better to invite the Emperor to set up a tent in a certain place outside the city in the name of hunting, and then bring the envoy for an audience.

In hunting, all etiquette rituals were simplified, and it had an "informal" meaning. The adverse effect of the other party not performing the kneeling and kowtowing ceremony could be reduced to the minimum.

So the next day, hunting was announced. The location of the hunt was not far from the Hun River. Huang Taiji and others intended to show the prestige of the Eight Banners, so they drew one thousand cavalry from the Eight Banners, plus another two hundred Red Armored and White Armored Bayara to guard the front and back of the Emperor. The Princes, Beiles, Beizes, Dukes, and Gusa Ejen (Banner Commanders) and other nobles as well as Bayaras accompanied them. At the same time, Sahalian was ordered to bring the mission to the hunting ground.

Huang Hua didn't know that the other party had already played a "discussion of etiquette" twist. Seeing Sahalian coming again, he didn't mention making him kowtow anymore, indicating that the Emperor's "Heavenly Grace is vast" and allowed him to have an audience with "foreign vassal etiquette". Huang Hua finally let out a sigh of relief—at least he wouldn't return without success.

The group then went to the hunting ground under the leadership of Manchu and Han officials—although called a hunting ground, it was actually near Shenyang. It took less than half a day to arrive. Approximately near noon, the business group arrived at the hunting ground.

This temporary hunting ground was located by the Taizi River. Huang Taiji's tent was set up on a hillside by the river. A huge yellow tent palace was in the center. Simple ceremonial guards were arranged outside the tent palace. Particularly awe-inspiring was a yellow umbrella representing imperial power standing there. There was another small tent outside the tent palace where officials were on duty, and rows of Bayara soldiers stood solemnly outside the door.

On the riverbank, more than a thousand elite Eight Banners soldiers lined up to welcome them. As the business group arrived, deep horns blew one after another, spreading far along the riverbank.

Huang Hua had been asked to get off the mule litter five li away. There was a rest tent here. The Ministry of Rites officials responsible for welcoming him asked him to rest and wash up a bit here, and change into formal wear to prepare for the audience. Then they sent hot water and food.

Huang Hua rested here for a while and ate something. Then he changed into formal attire—the Fubo Army wool winter uniform, with a black woolen coat belted at the waist, long boots on his feet, and a cotton-padded warm hat.

The twenty attendants he brought were also dressed in uniform, except their coats were gray. Everyone carried two newly improved 1632 model revolvers in a cross draw on their backs, and a machete at their waist. They were all elite soldiers selected from the Lingao Garrison Battalion, each looking heroic. when they walked out of the tent after changing clothes, they immediately caused a small commotion among the surrounding Manchu and Han officials and soldiers.

"Prepare a horse for the Lord!"

With an order, a bondservant led over an iron-gray steed. Huang Hua had run through Inner and Outer Mongolia, and knew at a glance that this was a good Mongolian horse appearing vigorous. He had practiced horseback riding hard in Lingao and was not unfamiliar with it. He immediately mounted the horse, and his subordinates also mounted together.

"Let's go." With Huang Hua's words, a leading *Janggin* raised a flag. Two hundred cavalry of the two Yellow Banners guarding in the distance immediately urged their horses to surround them. Each one fully armored, they galloped quickly past the mission, then immediately divided into two columns left and right, sandwiching the group in the middle, and headed towards the Imperial Tent.
