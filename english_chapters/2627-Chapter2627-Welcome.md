# Chapter 2627: Welcome

"Set tea for me in the pavilion."

The person speaking was named Li Guangyuan, about fifty years old, wearing a black gauze Dongpo towel on his head, dressed in a cloud-water pattern silk Taoist robe, leaving a wisp of clear beard under his chin. One look and [one] knew he was a local powerful gentry and big household.

Servant boys set down a folding-leg table in the pavilion, placing a whole set of tea sets. The bamboo-framed wind stove was stewing boiling water. someone else fetched a rattan chair produced in Qiongzhou.

Li Guangyuan sat down on the rattan chair, looking at the river surface. This pavilion was built on his family's private residence wharf, for welcoming and sending off noble guests. Sheltering from wind and rain.

The noble guest he wanted to welcome today, speaking of which, didn't count as how prominent. But the arrival of this person concerned the future fortune of his family. This couldn't help but make him anxious inside, calculating over and over in his heart whether this step he took was right or wrong.

Li Guangyuan's family was the biggest grain household in Li Family Enclosure, and also the patriarch of the Li surname in this village and several nearby villages. Besides industries in Li Family Enclosure, he also had business names in neighboring markets and Dongguan County. Although not counting as some ringing character in this county, in this area, he could count as a local tyrant standing like a tripod leg.

Servant boy lit tea water for him. Li Guangyuan held the tea cup tasting slowly—he was not thirsty, nor did he have any special appreciation ability for tea leaves. Drinking tea was just to conceal the anxiety in his heart, incidentally passing the boredom of waiting for people.

The person he wanted to wait for was named Luo Heying. Speaking of which, not an outsider. He lived in Wuxian Village, born with wide shoulders and round waist. Since childhood loved knight-errantry, traveled around Guangzhou Prefecture, having abundant knowledge. Luo Heying was zealous for public interests and justice, and had assets at home. Good fellows of both water and dry roads in the Guangzhou area had to give a face. His wife's family was a branch of Master Li's family within five mourning grades.

When thief bandits went upstream against the current to attack Sanliang back then, Wuxian Village was one of the joint guarantees. Luo Heying was also a clansman nephew of Luo Tianqiu family in Sanliang Market. When Luo Tianqiu was the Vice Regiment Commander of Dongguan County Regiment Training Bureau, he recommended this nephew to the county, acting the responsibility of "Leading Braves on Behalf."

This recommendation let Luo Heying escape with his life. When Sanliang was besieged, he was serving duty in the county. Hearing thief bandits besieged Sanliang, he hurriedly led hundreds of regiment braves back to rescue. However, the village braves gathered in the county were not his family's children soldiers. Hearing thief bandits were formidable, they were extremely afraid of war; no one was willing to go back to send themselves to death. Until hearing thief bandits withdrew troops, Luo Heying led family soldiers to rush back to Sanliang, seeing only devastation everywhere. Arriving at the Luo residence, inside was already looted empty long ago. Not one out of ten gentry and big households in the whole Sanliang Market survived. Finding Monk Daole who maintained order in the market to ask, only then knew the masters in the town were mostly killed or committed suicide. Family dependents also committed suicide in large numbers. The remaining were all abducted by thief bandits, whereabouts unknown.

Finally Monk Daole had collected and encoffined the corpses of these killed big households and dependents, temporarily stopping coffins in the temple. Luo Heying cried loudly in front of a crowd of coffins, swearing to take revenge and wipe out hatred.

However, thief bandits were already trace-less. Fortunately, one of the two principals of the Rehabilitation Bureau, Li Cunfa, was his wife's clan brother. From his mouth, Luo Heying roughly knew various things before and after the fall of Sanliang.

Hearing the clan uncle cursed thief bandits and would rather die than submit after being captured, finally being strangled by thief bandits on the threshing ground, Luo Heying's tears fell like rain. Hearing about Sai Qingxia's matter again, he immediately said: "Unexpectedly this girl was a strange woman! Body humble, actions had style of chivalry, like Nie Yinniang, Hong Xian and the like. Where is her corpse?"

"Already encoffined and buried." Li Cunfa said.

"Good, good. Burn incense and paper for me." After speaking, Luo Heying gave Li Cunfa one tael of silver, and asked clearly about various scenes after the fall of Sanliang one by one, so as to settle accounts after autumn in the future.

However, thief bandits were active frequently in this area. Luo Heying stayed in Sanliang for less than a day, family soldiers patrolling outside warned several times. Luo Heying helpless, could only return to Wuxian Village first, hiding to make plans later.

Unexpectedly staying in the village for not long, because Wuxian was Sanliang's joint guarantee, the thief bandit army moved towards Wuxian Village again. Rumors flew in the village for a time, saying Master Luo injured a thief bandit Director's life when leading braves outside. Thief bandits came to slaughter the village to vent anger. Under the instigation of a few weeds (bad people), foolish people in the village rushed into the Lin (Luo?) family wanting to seize the Lin family old and young to offer to thief bandits. Luo's wife was already seven months pregnant then. Under shock, she miscarried, finally actually two lives in one corpse. The Luo family full house was also abducted to Qiongzhou after thief bandits arrived. Real estate and land deeds at home were even sold cheaply to an evil gentry named Yuan Laoyuan. Luo Heying secretly reburied his wife in the Lin family ancestral grave, opened a cellar hiding money, and went to Foshan.

Foshan was a place where people from all directions mixed then. He had money in hand, so he lived tolerably in Foshan. He inquired about news of thief bandits from time to time, originally wanting to petition the Prefect after thief bandits retreated, return to Wuxian and Sanliang, punish those weeds and foolish men well, and seize back family property. Hard to wait until thief bandits retreated, before he went back to "counterattack and settle accounts," instead waited for family soldierssent by "Yuan Laoyuan" to collect rent.

This "Yuan Laoyuan" was said to be a local gentry, actually no one had seen him. But that gang of family soldiers under him were all extremely vicious. Twice a year in summer and autumn, all like government collecting taxes, coming to Wuxian to urge collection of "Burden." Money obtained naturally was handed to thief bandits. Regarding the matter of thief bandits wantonly collecting "Reasonable Burden" here, he either submitted petitions or through his own teacher and friend relationships, constantly offering words to presiding officials. Unexpectedly all sank into the sea like stones. Officials of Guangzhou Prefecture were either colluding with thief bandits, or shrank back avoiding seeing documents accusing bandits. Instead, cases involving "Anti-Bandit" were handled as urgent as star fire. The family soldiers he sent to catch "Bad people communicating with bandits," handled people just sent to the county were released, instead the two family soldiers he sent were beaten forty boards each before being released back.

On the land of Great Ming, thief bandits not only openly stole and sold his land, but also dignifiedly sent people to levy "Burden." The government still pretended to be deaf and dumb, even helping the tyrant to do evil. Luo Heying's eyes cracked with anger. Henceforth never believing the Court and government again, only thinking of taking revenge and wiping out hatred by himself.

He didn't return to Wuxian either, only hibernating in the Foshan area, wandering around from time to time, widely making friends with people of exceptional ability from various roads, taking the opportunity to raise death-sworn soldiers, preparing to assassinate a few True Kun to repay the revenge of destroyed family.

Staying for several years, during which he got to know many capable people and strangers active in Foshan, among whom were members of the Eight Immortals Society (*Baxian Hui*).

Eight Immortals Society was a branch of Tianmen Dao God Society. Originally Luo Heying was too lazy to pay attention to such bottom-society secret societies. But under contact with Eight Immortals Society, he felt this was a force quite utilizable.

Since the Court, this "Gentleman," was unreliable, had to rely on "Small People." Luo Heying joined the society. With his talent and ability, not long after joining he climbed to the Third Road Master of Eight Immortals Society. Also at this time thief bandits made a comeback—this time not just besieging Guangzhou and plundering four countrysides, but directly taking down Guangzhou, monkeys wearing hats (parvenus) founding a state and establishing systems.

Foshan originally had Loyalty Battalion, and many clan big households. Luo Heying originally thought there would be a battle. Didn't expect local gentry surrendered to thief bandits cleanly and neatly. Loyalty Battalion also changed body instantly, becoming Australians' "National Army."

When Luo Heying hesitated with nowhere to go, he got to know a good fellow at a ritual gathering of Eight Immortals Society. Henceforth, he threw himself into the "Anti-Bandit Great Cause."

Just that Foshan became some "Model County," coming a group of "Little Thief Bandits" with milk smell not dry yet. Luo Heying and Eight Immortals Society people couldn't keep footing in the county, having to split up and flee to Nanhai, Xiangshan, Sanshui and other places. Hibernating to wait for opportunity.

Ten days ago, he received a letter from Li Guangyuan. Master Li had made up his mind to join the "Great Cause." Immediately invited several good fellows to bring his name card to go first. He himself waited for several days, gathering another two companions before taking a boat straight to Li Family Enclosure.

Getting off the boat, Li family servants welcomed early. Coming all the way to the tea pavilion, Li Guangyuan welcomed out immediately. Two sides exchanged greetings.

"Brother Lin's expression is as old (spirited)." Li Guangyuan held wrists before chest bowing, "Don't know who the two behind Brother Lin are?"

"This is my clan younger brother, Luo Hetu. Fought out of Sanliang Market with me back then." Luo Heying pointed to a young man behind him carrying a long strip parcel obliquely, saying.

Regarding the Battle of Sanliang Market, neither he himself nor Luo Hetu participated at all. However, these years Luo Heying constantly bragged about his "Past Events" in Sanliang Market: what personally leading village braves killing until blood flowed into rivers; thief bandits couldn't advance an inch into Sanliang. Later thief bandits urgently transferred all cannons, shelling Sanliang. For a time sky shook earth moved, sun and moon dull. He fought a bloody road out of ten thousand horses and armies to escape alive, etc.

Fortunately, the current principal of Sanliang, Li Cunfa, was his wife's clan younger brother. He mostly knew various things of Sanliang offense and defense before and after. This also gave Luo Heying capital to brag.

"Indeed hero tiger might, majestic and awe-inspiring."

Luo Heying turned to another side, introducing a monk wearing monk robes in a low voice: "This is Master Haixiang. Originally a person of Lingao County, Qiongzhou Prefecture. Fought thief bandits when thief bandit iron ships landed back then. Later traveled to learn to Guangzhou Prefecture. Can be called Great Ming's number one person understanding bandit affairs. This time originally intended to go to capital to meet the Emperor to present thief bandit details directly, to prepare strategies. I specially kept Mister to linger for a few days, first tell us the details of thief bandits."

Gou Xunli drifted for many years, already trained a face of Diamond Indestructible (thick skin). Hearing Luo Heying bragging about him like this, face didn't change heart didn't beat, only making a posture of an expert outside the world, holding wrists to bow to Li Guangyuan.

Li Guangyuan heard the origin, couldn't help looking a few more times. Seeing this person body dry and thin, movements sonorous, looking like a scene person experienced wind and rain at first glance. This so-called "Monk," nine out of ten was also a "Wild Fox Zen" (fake monk) without ordination certificate (*Dudie*), presumably shaving hair to become a monk to avoid thief bandits. Immediately returned greeting: "So it is Master Haixiang. Please Master delay a few more days at the manor. This time thief bandits come ferociously; what intention exactly, still please Mister teach." Then faced everyone saying, "Please everyone go to home first. Li has prepared wine banquet to wash dust for everyone."
