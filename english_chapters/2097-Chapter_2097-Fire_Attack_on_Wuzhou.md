# Chapter 2097 - Fire Attack on Wuzhou

Before long, a shop hand came to report: "The Brother-in-law is here."

"Show him in."

This "brother-in-law" wasn't his wife's sibling but the brother of the concubine he'd taken in Wuzhou—a minor boss among the dock porters, a local tough. Luo Yangming had taken his sister as a concubine partly to exploit this sort of "man who could get things done anywhere."

The "brother-in-law" was surnamed Wen, nicknamed "Iron Head." Supposedly, during a dock turf war, he'd taken a blade to the skull—blood streaming—and kept swinging his cudgel anyway. That earned him his reputation. Now he commanded over thirty porters and was one of Wuzhou's somewhat notable "hard men."

Wen Tietou was small in stature but had developed a powerful physique from years of dock work. He'd arrived in a hurry; his short jacket was covered in dust and straw.

Luo Yangming invited him to sit. Wen Tietou waved dismissively and just asked for tea.

"A-Chun, bring tea!" Luo Yangming quickly ordered.

"No need!" Wen Tietou shook his head. "I'm parched—can't drink hot tea. You've got lukewarm tea for the servants—just bring me a big bowl of that."

They brought a large bowl of tea. Wen Tietou grabbed it and drained it clean, then looked around. Seeing no one else in the room, he whispered:

"Brother-in-law—there's trouble!"

Luo Yangming was startled: "What?!"

Wen Tietou lowered his voice to barely a murmur: "Brother-in-law, do you know what's been shipped out of the docks these past few days? They say besides the official granaries, it's the officials' private property?"

Luo Yangming nodded: "I know. They say it's all going to Guilin Prefecture..."

Wen Tietou shook his head: "Ah, but you don't know the whole story. The officials' property is going to Guilin, true—but the government granaries' grain and cloth are being shipped to Teng County."

Luo Yangming was puzzled. Teng County was a subordinate county of Wuzhou, just upstream on the West River—hardly a defensible position. If Xiong Wenchan planned to abandon Wuzhou and flee to Teng County, what could he hope to accomplish? If he didn't intend to defend Teng County, why ship the treasury's grain and cloth there?

Wen Tietou said: "I've been wondering too—what's Governor Xiong's game?" He slapped his thigh. "Only today did I figure it out!"

"What game?" Luo Yangming pressed.

"Burning Wuzhou to the ground!"

"What?!" Luo Yangming nearly cried out.

Like most seventeenth-century cities, Wuzhou's buildings were primarily wood. Roofs—except for wealthy homes and government offices—were mostly thatch. Partition walls often used bamboo strips. Everything was combustible. Once a fire started, it spread. A single blaze destroying ten or a hundred homes was not unusual. Fire prevention was normally paramount.

Now Xiong Wenchan was actually planning to burn Wuzhou?! In an instant, Luo Yangming went cold all over. This was a prefectural city with over ten thousand households! One fire—how many would die? How many families would be made homeless? Property losses would be beyond reckoning...

"Is this true?!" He stared tensely at his "brother-in-law."

"True!" Wen Tietou whispered. "You're my brother-in-law—why would I lie? Truth is, I only found out this morning."

These past days, while the government shipped grain and treasure out, they'd simultaneously been moving straw and pottery jars into the city. The dock porters all found it strange—what was Xiong Wenchan up to?

"I made quiet inquiries and discovered the jars are filled with gunpowder and sulfur—siege materials, nothing unusual. But the soldiers have the look of men about to flee. They've already shipped out several cannons. Why bring in these supplies now? Add all those boatloads of straw coming in—damn me if this isn't preparation for arson!"

Luo Yangming nodded. Wen Tietou's deduction made sense—no wonder people said hardened men had sharp minds.

"...Because of all this, I got curious. You know I'm friendly with Liu the Clerk from the county office's Military Room. So I went to find out from him. At first the old bastard hemmed and hawed, but when I pressed him he finally dropped a hint: 'The wise man doesn't stand beneath a crumbling wall.' Then I poked around the alley behind the yamen and found out: plenty of minor officials and clerks have taken their whole families and run! Damn them—they've kept the common folk completely in the dark!" He paused for breath. "I came to tell you: while the gates are still open, get your family out to the countryside to wait it out. Otherwise you'll be trapped in the city—once they light it up, you can cry to heaven or earth and no one will answer!"

After Wen Tietou left, Luo Yangming paced the counting room in circles. No doubt about it—Xiong Wenchan was plotting something big. From his "brother-in-law's" account, Xiong very likely planned to use Wuzhou as a trap, luring the Fubo Army into the city, then setting it ablaze.

This tactic was ancient; that Xiong Wenchan, cornered, might resort to it wasn't surprising.

But this put the Fubo Army in serious danger!

He had to get this intelligence out immediately!

His intelligence transmissions went through a courier. Because Wuzhou wasn't a priority collection area, in the past couriers had come only once a month; after the Guangdong offensive, that had increased to once a week.

Only three days had passed since the last courier visit. Once the main force reached the walls, the gates would certainly close, and the courier couldn't get in. He wasn't even sure the courier would come in four days.

His only option now was as Wen Tietou suggested—leave the city immediately. Once outside, he'd have a chance to go directly to the Fubo Army camp and report his intelligence to the officers in person.

But leaving required somewhere to go. Luo Yangming had no farm outside the walls. Wen Tietou's home was outside the city, but right at the docks—also a danger zone. After much thought, he recalled that his warehouse manager's home was in the mountains twenty *li* north of the city. He'd already temporarily dismissed all local workers a few days ago. Better to take his family and seek refuge there.

His mind made up, he immediately opened the door to call someone. Suddenly the street outside erupted in noisy footsteps and panicked screams—as if a pot had suddenly boiled over.

Before he could summon anyone to ask, a shop hand came stumbling in, shouting: "Disaster! The pirates are attacking!"

Atop the Nanxun Gate tower of Wuzhou, Yang Yi was standing guard.

Yang Yi was an ordinary soldier of the Wuzhou Guard Battalion. Though Guard soldiers spent more time farming than drilling or fighting, and he held his spear like a hoe, he had at least seen action, raiding mountain settlements—if only as a baggage carrier trailing behind the combat troops.

The spear wasn't very handy, and it was too old! Yang Yi looked at his weapon: the shaft was new, but the blade was rusted—obviously old stock from years ago. Whether it would hold up in battle was anyone's guess.

Of course, whether it held up hardly mattered to him. Yang Yi had already made up his mind: the moment the officers disappeared, he'd bolt. Whoever wanted to "die loyally for the nation" could do it—he wasn't about to. After a year of labor, he'd barely received a few coins of pay and grain, worked to exhaustion yet never getting enough to eat. Only a fool would fight and die for that!

*Damned pirates!* Looking out at the pitch-black night beyond the walls, he cursed silently. If not for their attack, he'd be sleeping at home right now. Tomorrow morning he'd pick up his hoe and tend his own fields—instead of being dragged here to fight and stand watch in the middle of the night.

Though Yang Yi had accompanied units on raids against various "Yao and Dong" tribes, he'd only tagged along at the rear waving banners and shouting—couldn't wield weapons, never killed anyone. Being pressed into defending Wuzhou was purely to fill numbers.

He'd been assigned to night watch atop Nanxun Gate tower for several consecutive days now. No one had come to relieve them.

Looking at his fellow unlucky watchmen—*damned officers!*—Yang Yi cursed again in his heart.

Yang Yi was desperately sleepy; his eyelids felt weighted with lead. Several other night-watch soldiers had given up and leaned against the battlements, propped on their spears, fast asleep. Yang Yi didn't quite dare sleep—because last midnight the *baihu* had suddenly come to inspect and caught him dozing. They'd said he was to be beheaded on the spot. Terrified, the whole group had dropped to their knees, kowtowing and begging until the punishment was reduced to forty strokes of the rod. Even now his buttocks still stung as if burned.

*Damned officers!*—Yang Yi cursed once more in his heart.
