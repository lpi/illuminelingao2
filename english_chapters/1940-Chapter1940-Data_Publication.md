# Chapter 1940 - Data Publication

The reason was simple. After deciding to go to the new world in the old timeline, due to his long-term engagement in the medical system informatization business, Senator Xu used his connections to secure a lot of medical instruments and equipment for the Transmigration Group, and at the same time funded the targeted donation of a large amount of medical supplies. Whether this was out of public spirit or merely considering personal well-being after transmigration, or just the nature of a tycoon, the result of all this was: opening the list of equity conversion for the Transmigration Group, Senator Xu's name ranked within the top ten. Since Senator Xu was already thirty-five when he transmigrated, and was single, he could already be classified into the ranks of middle-aged uncles among the team of Senators who were generally in their early twenties. Thus, he earned the nickname "Xu Laowu" (Xu the Fifth) within the circle of familiar Senators.

The post and the replies hyping it up repeatedly emphasized the so-called unfairness brought about by this. It was nothing more than questioning: just because one had money in the original timeline, should they also control a large amount of wealth in the new timeline? For instance, should a military Senator who came from a loser background in the old timeline and braved death on the front lines endure seeing most of the world he fought hard to conquer distributed to these old-timeline tycoons sitting in offices, while he only received the returns of a mere 100,000 basic shares? Take this Xu Laowu as an example. He had a few coins in the original timeline, so he could lord it over others in this new world? Although because the issue was sensitive and involved personal attacks on Senators, this series of posts was deleted by the admin not long after, Senator Xu knew that this could only be the beginning of the next political storm.

When he first saw it, Senator Xu was shocked, and then inevitably filled with indignation. Leaving aside the agreed spirit of contract and so on, just being singled out as an example in this post, fiercely criticized as a negative model merely based on good office working conditions without knowing or understanding the hardship and value of his work at all, Senator Xu was a million times unconvinced in his heart. Being chosen as an example was really just the poster picking a soft persimmon to squeeze.

If one opened the roster, besides CEO Wen mentioned earlier and the North American Gang of Three as the core of the Otaku Party, listed in the top ten were also the incumbent Chairman Wang of the Senate, Minister of Economy and Industry Zhan Wuya, and Landu who paid a high boat ticket price, etc. Even Secretary of State Ma, known as the spokesperson of the proletariat, and Director Xiao who usually didn't show off, were actually ranked within the top 50. It was just that these people were either high-ranking and powerful, held guns in their hands, or had a large interest group supporting them behind their backs. A post meant to test the waters naturally wasn't suitable for poking these hornet's nests. He, a "decadent and degenerate element" from the old timeline, a technical worker who only knew how to bury his head in work in this new world, undoubtedly became the best scapegoat and stepping stone.

However, thinking about it again, Senator Xu's anger subsided a bit. In the end, wasn't this similar to the common conflict between venture capital and employee stock ownership in the old timeline? In the beginning, capital was undoubtedly urgent and necessary. When you provided help in someone's hour of need, it was easy to get a larger share. But as the business continuously developed and grew, employees who became more confident would inevitably be dissatisfied with the distribution of interests; they naturally hoped to get more. So, there is never anything new under the sun. What he was encountering now was just the struggle between VC and employees in the new timeline. What's more, in this company, the management itself was the largest shareholding shareholder. Even if the sky fell, the tall ones would hold it up, so what was he anxious about?

Subsequent developments confirmed his judgment. The admin quickly deleted the posts and silenced users, and related remarks did not appear again. No trace was seen in any public meetings or paper records. Obviously, the current those in power did not want to open this jar. But Senator Xu's intuition told him that this matter was not simple. An undercurrent or several undercurrents had already fixed their eyes on this topic, and consequently, he had also entered the scope of attention of certain people or forces. Perhaps in the not-so-distant future, a bigger storm would fall on his head. An obvious piece of evidence was that although everyone pretended this post didn't exist, his nickname "Xu Laowu" had already spread widely.

Apart from checking the BBS situation from time to time, Senator Xu handled some routine official documents of "waiting for this and that," and then began the final heavyweight task of the day: checking and approving this week's data statistics report. This work originated from the Second Plenary Session, where Senators expressed that as the plate became larger and larger, everyone usually knew very little about the progress of work outside their own turf, especially lacking authoritative statistical data. They believed this situation affected the Senators' due right to know and right to participate in and deliberate on state affairs, and even triggered a group of "soy sauce" Senators to verbally attack the ruling class for data deception. In response to the criticism, the newly established cabinet tasked the Planning Agency to take the lead, with the Data Center specifically responsible, to establish a data reporting system open to all Senators.

According to the requirements, the Data Center would submit a report on the latest data for the week every week, and a report on the overall situation every quarter. Simply put, the weekly data report was relatively simple, mainly including summaries of some business progress, such as the number of people purified this week, imports and exports and inventory changes of important materials, output of major products in the industrial sector, sales volume in the commercial sector, and so on. The quarterly report covered many more aspects, including changes in the effectively controlled area dealing with the quarter, currency issuance and tax revenue, population changes in the quarter, progress of important projects in the quarter, etc. Currently, the weekly data report was only released in network form, while the quarterly report had a paper version issued as needed, mainly provided to Senators stationed outside who could not access the internet.

"Data publication, data publication—useless. Everyone just slaps their head to find evidence. When you bring out figures, they say you're forging them!" Xu Laowu complained.

As the specific person in charge of this work, Senator Xu's biggest bellyful of complaints was: just how many people actually read these reports that took countless time and energy to summarize and organize. The effect of the paper version was unclear, but judging from the page views of the web version, the situation was really not optimistic. Naturally, professional departments needed these data, but those Senators who took Senatorial power very seriously and often wanted to "sit and talk about the Dao" to reflect their "Senators participating in state affairs," mostly used "I feel" or "I think" or simply fabrications during certain discussions, completely ignoring serious data.

"You complain every day that the Ming Dynasty lacked digital management, but you yourselves act like Ming bureaucrats!" Xu Laowu continued to complain in his heart looking at these dense data—he knew very well how much manpower and material resources it took to collect and generate these data. It could be said that this was the most important basis for a country and a regime to formulate policies and laws, worthy of being called a huge fortune.

However, for future historians and economists, these reports would become the most important authoritative source of information, and quite a few Ph.D. dogs would dig out the core material for their dissertations from them. Of course, all this had nothing to do with Senator Xu.

By the time he finished checking the data in the report, confirmed it met the release format and standards, and submitted it to his direct superior, Minister of Planning Wu De, via the internal workflow, the hour hand on the wall had already passed 8 PM.

Normally, Xu Yicheng should have gone home to rest by now. But there was still a lot of work to complete on the night shift today. Feng Nuo in the "backend" hadn't left either, so he decided to stay here and work overtime. Firstly to keep an eye on the inputters—although the Four Heavenly Kings had got off work, in the night shift there were still the "Three Noble Families" whose input error rates were barely passing, so he had to keep a close watch. Secondly, both the Secretary of State's Office and the Planning Agency had greeted him: a second Data and Computing Center would soon be established in Guangzhou, and he needed to prepare relevant plans and proposals.

One obvious thing was that due to the critical state of the Senate's electronic equipment reserves, the Data Computing Center in Lingao would be the most powerful data computing center in their lifetime—these already built facilities and operational equipment would not be considered for dismantling or relocation.

In this way, how to configure equipment and arrange personnel for the Data Center in Guangzhou became a rather complicated issue. It was necessary to consider maintaining the original scale and capacity of this computing center in Lingao, while also enhancing the computing capacity of the new center in Guangzhou as much as possible, and also considering the opening of a third computing center and the issue of spare parts in the future.

If only the reserve issue needed to be considered, things would be easier to solve. Ever since Feng Nuo took the lead and the Ministry of Science and Technology started that mechanical computer project, the design of the new computing center had to consider how to "fully utilize" the efficacy of these devices that were currently still on paper.

"This is a tough nut to crack." Xu Laowu was a bit troubled. He wasn't clear to what extent the so-called mechanical computer Feng Nuo bragged about could actually achieve, and to what extent it could replace the currently used equipment. So he couldn't estimate the related equipment needs.

He decided to think it over carefully in the office tonight—he couldn't get anything done at home.

Here he could think about problems and formulate plans quietly. Home wasn't so peaceful. Xu Laowu had two "Living Secretaries" at home, one Chinese and one Western, who had each given birth to a child for him recently. It was said to be a complete family with a son and a daughter, but a family of five squeezed into a two-bedroom apartment, with two infants who couldn't walk crying and shouting at night, was not a pleasant taste. Xu Laowu often complained about this—running to the 17th century to be a master, only to become a household with extreme housing difficulties.

Naturally, under such an environment, if Xu Laowu could sleep peacefully at home, it would be considered extremely lucky. So his going home now was basically just for eating and sleeping. Even discussing matters with people required going out to the Nanhai Coffee House—or simply sitting on a bench by the green space in the residential area.
