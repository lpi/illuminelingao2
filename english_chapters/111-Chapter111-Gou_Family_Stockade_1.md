# Chapter 111 - Gou Family Stockade (1)

While the work of the salt field work team was unfolding vigorously, the preparations for the hunting operation to eradicate Great Household Gou were also underway. Xi Yazhou demanded it to be as early as possible—there were still many people from the village locked up in the private jail of Gou Family Stockade. However, the Executive Committee was not in a hurry. Anyway, the people of Salt Field Village were not their relatives. Everything had to be investigated clearly first. After two or three days of investigation, the Executive Committee knew that this person was detested by everyone and hated by dogs. The title of local tyrant and evil gentry was not at all excessive for him. Getting rid of him would satisfy everyone in the county from top to bottom. Although Great Household Gou did not provoke this group of time-space bandits, at most using their banner to swindle, the transmigrators urgently needed to demonstrate their greatness, glory, and correctness, and incidentally improve their meals. Thus, Great Household Gou's fate was decided.

The direct reason for eliminating Great Household Gou was his attempt to control the salt field, but the Executive Committee did not hand the task directly to the work team. Instead, a separate group was established to be responsible for this matter. The person in charge was Comrade Wu De, who had been dealing with locals for a long time.

Some bachelors from Wu De's production team had returned. They had no attachments, so they went back to pack up their broken belongings. Those working as long-term laborers just went to resign from their masters. As for wages, the masters didn't dare say no—everyone knew that this group of poor barbarians went to work for the short-hairs. If they put in a bad word in front of the short-hairs, anyone would be in trouble.

Wu De selected a few from these people, disguised as peddlers and temporary workers, to scout for movements of Great Household Gou and the county government everywhere. He himself was not idle either; he got into a car and went directly to the county town.

At the south gate of the county, he met Inspector Fu. This inspector of Bopu Inspection Office became the only person dissatisfied with the status quo—his government office was gone, which he couldn't explain no matter what. So these days he had been going in and out of Zhang Youfu's place, begging him to go to Bairen Beach to mediate, return the government office to him, and in the future, the gray income of the Inspection Office would be split fifty-fifty.

How clever a person was Zhang Youfu? How could he get involved in such things? He kept making excuses about poor health and refused to go. Inspector Fu couldn't use force either, so he stood guard at the county gate every day with a sad face—this was a temporary job assigned to him by Magistrate Wu.

Seeing the short-hair leader suddenly visit, Inspector Fu was greatly surprised. Fortunately, his Mandarin could manage a few sentences. After gesturing back and forth, Inspector Fu realized that this person wanted to see the county magistrate.

The bandit leader wanted to see the magistrate; this shocked Inspector Fu. However, he dared not neglect it and hurried to the county office to report to Magistrate Wu. This scared Wu Mingjin so much that his hands and feet turned cold—these days he had already sent people to the provincial capital to seek a transfer. Before the matter was settled, the bandit came to the door. What should be done? Seeing him would inevitably arouse suspicion of colluding with bandits; not seeing him, the county's current state was like a girl without clothes. Not to mention the militia in the city, even the runners had gone to the countryside to urge the collection of autumn grain.

He hurried to call the private adviser. The adviser's idea was straightforward: it was inconvenient for official circles to appear, so it would be better for him as a private representative to meet and probe what the other party meant. After all, the adviser was only a private employee of the magistrate, and his status made it easier to maneuver.

Wu De's request was simple: to collect salt tax on behalf of the government and organize village braves. This matter made Advisor Wang a bit troubled. Salt Field Village wanting to organize braves was a small matter; there were village braves almost everywhere in the county. One more or one less was not a problem, and the petition was indeed written by the villagers of Salt Field Village. But the Gou family would not be happy about this.

The county knew clearly about the Gou family's actions, but the magistrate generally had no way to deal with such local tyrants. Moreover, in such a remote border county, it was good enough that the Gou family didn't openly rebel.

Collecting salt tax on behalf of the government and organizing braves in Salt Field Village—anyone with a slight knowledge of the county situation could see that this group of short-hairs was preparing to snatch meat from the Gou family's mouth.

The problem was that the county couldn't afford to offend either the Gou family or the short-hairs now. Comparatively speaking, the short-hairs were even less to be offended. After discussing with Magistrate Wu, Advisor Wang gave a flexible answer:

The salt tax silver is to be handed in on the first day of the eleventh lunar month. Whoever comes to hand it in first will be the one to monopolize it.

The implication was: you guys compete fairly; we, the government, won't interfere. Whoever is the champion gets the reward of this salt tax. As for organizing braves, the county doesn't object; just do it.

After reaching a tacit understanding on this issue, Wu De took his leave and went back to start preparations for attacking Gou Family Stockade.

Speaking of providing the most information about the Gou family, it was Zhang Xingjiao. He was from Gou Family Stockade himself. But the Executive Committee didn't fully trust his intelligence—people with grudges often exaggerated or downplayed certain content. Wu De still hoped to understand the basic situation himself.

After sending people to investigate and inquire everywhere, Gou Family Stockade was actually not called Gou Family Stockade; its real name was Damei Village. This Damei Village was located in the Gaosanling area northwest of Lingao. The Gou family were outsiders in the village, but these outsiders were not simple; they were remnants after the Japanese pirate turmoil in Zhejiang and Fujian was pacified—gentlemen, do not think the Gou family were descendants of Japanese. The Japanese pirate turmoil in the Ming Dynasty always had Chinese as BOSSes; Japanese were just working boys, and not very high-level working boys at that, basically belonging to those who charged as vanguards and covered the rear when retreating. The ancestors of the Gou family were at least chieftains, not so unbearable. Not only did his family flee here, but he also brought many accomplices and subordinates. Arriving at this village, they found that although it was close to the county town, it was located in a mountainous area and easy to defend. It was also close to the seaside. They simply settled down, killed or drove away the original landlords, and grandly became landlord masters. Their power expanded slowly, vaguely becoming a local tyrant in the county, and Damei Village also turned into Gou Family Stockade.

There were actually not many fields in the mountain village, and the Gou family had only a hundred mu or so. But the Gou family was powerful and overbearing. Although they had no official degrees, they forced people outside the stockade to bring land and submit to them through both soft and hard tactics. Gradually, the land under their name reached nearly a thousand mu. In these years, taxes became heavier daily, and many villagers voluntarily submitted to his name—although exploited severely, they could still scrape a living.

Relying on these fields, collecting a large amount of rent every year, and also engaging in usury, the Gou family accumulated considerable property. There were more than two hundred households in the stockade, with a population of men, women, old, and young over a thousand. The village was located on a small hillside, not steep, but there were many village braves and family guards, mostly desperate outlaws fleeing from the mainland, bachelors without family or property. The village stockade was heavily defended with two layers of earthen walls. The outer layer was inhabited by ordinary villagers, tenants, and farmhands, while the inner layer was the residence of more than ten households of the Gou family's main clan. It was guarded by specially kept family guards; no one could enter the inner stockade unless they were acquaintances of this village.

Even more awesome was that the Gou family continued the pirate tradition of their ancestors. Although they didn't do it themselves, they colluded with small groups of bandits on the sea—they couldn't cling to the thighs of figures like Liu Laoxiang (Liu Xiang), but small groups of pirates were as numerous as ox hairs on the sea. Although pirates made a living on the sea, they still had to come ashore to get water, dispose of stolen goods after robbery, and recuperate on shore when injured or sick—so regardless of scale, pirates had to have a harbor family on shore. The Gou family was such a harbor family—but they also had principles: never dispose of stolen goods locally in Lingao. Firstly, this place was small and didn't have such strong purchasing power; secondly, to avoid making a big fuss and provoking the government. According to mastered intelligence, the whereabouts of the stolen goods all went to Qiongshan. This local rich man, the Gou family, surprisingly had business in Qiongshan. Their awareness of commodity economy seemed very strong.

Although Qiongshan was richer and more prosperous than Lingao, it was only the head county of Qiongzhou Prefecture after all. The Intelligence and Information Group of the Executive Committee inferred that the Gou family's business in Qiongshan was merely a window for selling stolen goods to the mainland area.

To find out the specific situation and defense of Gou Family Stockade, Wu De requested to send a professional reconnaissance team to conduct reconnaissance. Bei Wei was not in Bairen City, but the reconnaissance team he trained single-handedly had begun to take shape. Recommended by Bei Wei, Xue Ziliang led the team to execute this reconnaissance mission—the Executive Committee received protests from some people again, saying that such important military affairs shouldn't be entrusted to this ABC. Fortunately, he was recommended by a heavyweight military leader like Bei Wei; otherwise, hats like colluding with foreign countries and worshiping foreign things would be indispensable.

For Xue Ziliang, such a reconnaissance operation was purely at a pediatric level. However, his attitude was still very correct. After all, it was the first time the organization let him be fully responsible; he could only do it well and make no mistakes. Ye Mengyan finally got his first real mission too. He immediately put on all kinds of private goods from his luggage: jungle BDU, US military individual equipment LC1, whether genuine or civilian version, real or fake, all piled on his body. For someone like Xue Ziliang who used genuine goods for a long time, this set of half-real half-fake outfit was amateurish to the extreme. Plus an 80-style helmet on his head and an SKS rifle in his hand, he looked just like a South American guerrilla.

"No need for so much equipment; our reconnaissance mission is very simple."

Although Xue Ziliang was not well-received by nationalists, he was very popular in Bei Wei's reconnaissance team—capable people can stand out anywhere. He was different from Bei Wei. Although Bei Wei had solid scout skills, his actual combat experience was zero. Xue Ziliang had at least mixed in the Middle East and executed quite a few missions with real swords and guns. In terms of combat experience, except for He Ming who had fought Vietnamese, there was really no second one. Young men who loved military affairs particularly liked this, so Xue Ziliang talked at length about his combat experiences and various anecdotes in the US military to cater to their tastes. He was sociable and grew up in the United States, inheriting the American tradition of chattering. Night life in Lingao was dull and boring, so listening to him brag became the only entertainment for the reconnaissance team at night.

"Then what to bring?" Little Ye was unwilling. Wouldn't it be in vain to bring this equipment without a chance to show off?

"Ordinary equipment is OK." Xue Ziliang knew other things didn't matter; the key was to find a guide. Damei Village couldn't be found on maps printed in the 21st century.
