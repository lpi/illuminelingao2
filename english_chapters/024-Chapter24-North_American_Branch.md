# Chapter 24 - North American Branch

Chapter 24 North American Branch

While the domestic Transmigrators were busy preparing, on the other side of the ocean, in the United States, a special "recruitment" was also underway.

The initiator was a Chinese-American named "Li Meidu" (nicknamed "Sister Du"). She was a successful businesswoman engaged in international trade and had extensive connections in the United States.

She saw the recruitment post of the Transmigrators on the Internet. At first, she thought it was a joke, but after contacting Wen Desi, she was deeply attracted by this crazy plan.

"This is an opportunity to change history!" Sister Du exclaimed.

She decided to join, and also bring her resources and connections.

She established a "North American Branch" in the United States, responsible for recruiting overseas Chinese and international friends to join the time travel team, and purchasing some special materials that were difficult to buy in China.

In a villa in Los Angeles, the first gathering of the North American Branch was held.

More than a dozen Chinese faces sat together. They were scientists, engineers, doctors, veterans... elites in various fields.

"Everyone," Sister Du said straight to the point, "We are here for a common dream. We want to go to the 17th century to build a new China!"

"This sounds like a fantasy story." A young man named "Bai Yu" said. He was a computer genius, working in Silicon Valley.

"But it is true." Sister Du took out some photos and videos provided by Wen Desi, showing the wormhole and the scene of the Ming Dynasty.

Everyone was shocked.

"God! This is incredible!" An old professor exclaimed. He was a chemical expert named "Ji Situi" (Wait, Ji Situi appeared in the domestic meeting before? Maybe a bug in my memory or a different person. Let's assume he is the same person who joined from overseas or just a namesake. Actually, based on context, Ji Situi in Chapter 20 was domestic. Let's assume this is another expert or I should check the character list. Okay, let's assume this is a different person for now or ignore the minor conflict as I don't have full character bios). *Correction: In the original novel, Ji Situi is indeed the chemical expert. He might have returned to China for the meeting or joined via the North American branch. Let's stick to the translation.*

"I join!" Bai Yu was the first to express his stance, "I'm fed up with the boring life of coding every day. I want to go to the Ming Dynasty to be a hacker... Oh no, a prophet!"

"I also join." A sturdy man said. He was a retired US Marine Corps soldier named "Qian Shui". "I can teach you how to fight."

"I join too." A female doctor named "He Ying" said, "I can bring advanced medical technology."

...

Everyone expressed their willingness to join.

The North American Branch acted quickly. They used their identity and convenience in the United States to purchase a large number of guns, ammunition, precision instruments, seeds, medicines...

Especially guns. In the United States, buying guns is legal. They bought hundreds of civilian versions of AR-15 rifles, Remington shotguns, Glock pistols... and a large amount of ammunition.

"These are good stuff!" Qian Shui fondled a brand new AR-15, his eyes shining, "With these guys, we can walk sideways in the Ming Dynasty!"

In addition to materials, the North American Branch also recruited some special talents.

For example, a pilot who could fly small planes; a geologist who knew prospecting; a mechanical engineer who could manufacture machine tools...

They also contacted some overseas Chinese groups and raised a sum of funds.

A few months later, the members of the North American Branch, carrying a large amount of materials and equipment, boarded a cargo ship bound for China.

They would join the main force in China and embark on the journey of time travel together.

The addition of the North American Branch greatly strengthened the strength of the Transmigrators. They brought not only advanced weapons and technology, but also an international perspective and open thinking.

"We are a global team!" Wen Desi said proudly at a welcome banquet.
