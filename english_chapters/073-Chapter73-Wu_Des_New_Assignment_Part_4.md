# Chapter 73: Wu De's New Assignment (Part 4)

"Ah De, isn't this a bit much?"

"You people—one more ruthless than the next when talking, but someone cries and you can't handle it?" Wu De said coldly to Yuan Qiushi. "Whoever cries gets beaten hard. Beat them until they stop."

Young Yuan was indeed young—merciless. The stick cracked down. Xiong Buyou bellowed: "No crying! Stand up straight!"

Wu De knew these five couldn't even make it to tenant farmer or long-term laborer status—they were the lowest rung of old China's rural hierarchy: day laborers. A tenant at least had a shelter and some land to work, even if not their own; a long-term laborer at least had a shed and enough coarse grain. These people truly had nothing—not a tile above nor a furrow below, never knowing where their next meal would come from. A flicker of pity rose in his heart. But he quickly suppressed it. Pity was a luxury the transmigrators couldn't afford. They'd arrived in a timespace not their own; everything had to be paved with others' blood and sweat. What did enslaving a few people matter now?

After the beating, the prisoners were completely cowed—heads lowered, not daring to look up. Each understood: this was their overseer now. Apparently they wouldn't be killed immediately; future days depended on this man's personal whims. These pirates weren't even afraid of the government—what were a few commoners to them? Killing someone was like squashing a fly.

"Today is our first meeting. From now on, you belong to us transmigrators." Wu De raised his voice. "Whatever I say, you do! Work hard, and you'll get two meals and clothes. Otherwise..." He snorted coldly. "From tomorrow, Overseer Xiong won't be translating for you. If you don't understand me once, twice—I'll forgive. The third time you don't understand—you get dragged out and beheaded! What use is such trash?" He spoke harshly; Xiong Buyou screamed along, apparently trying to accurately convey his spirit.

Language was the biggest obstacle between transmigrators and local laborers. Wu De obviously couldn't keep the team's only translator by his side constantly. For rapid learning, harsh brutality was more effective than gentle guidance.

The prisoners' faces showed unease, but under his sweeping gaze, all heads drooped.

Hippo whispered nearby: "Isn't constant death-threatening bad? What if they can't learn—actually kill them?"

Wu De glanced at him with displeasure, snorting: "Then we kill them."

Hippo's neck suddenly felt cold. He knew well how human brutality could escalate without constraints.

"Now roll call. When your name is called, answer 'Here!' That's the first rule you must remember. One missed call: 40 lashes of rattan. Two: 80 lashes. Three: 200."

"Wang Tian!" Wu De called the first name on the list.

"Huh?" came the response from a short man—maybe 150 centimeters—probably early twenties.

"Say 'Here!'" Young Yuan, perfectly coordinated, brought the lash down.

Wang Tian, corrected by the rod, quickly fixed his mistake.

"Lin Xing!"

The responder's voice was loud, but the pronunciation still unintelligible. This one looked taller, stronger. Though his head was lowered, Wu De still saw a trace of defiance.

"I can't understand." Wu De was determined to break that last bit of defiance. He waved—another beating—until the prisoner more or less correctly shouted "Here!"

Example sets everything—the next three managed reasonably correct "Here!" calls. Once basically acceptable, Wu De led them to work. He served as both guard and supervisor—two birds, one stone. The site didn't actually need these few workers.

He deliberately positioned them near the machinery. At such close range, watching construction equipment work was awe-inspiring even for modern people—let alone peasants who'd never left the county. Once they discovered the transmigrators possessed not just their lowly selves but irresistible overwhelming power, they would become loyal—eventually even proud of the strength of the organization enslaving them.

When the excavator roared and swung its arm toward them, all five bolted in terror—until Wu De stopped them.

"Running where? Work!"

The prisoners knelt, desperately pleading. Though they spoke incomprehensible gibberish, Wu De understood—they feared the giant machine, thinking it some monster. Only when he pointed to the transparent cab showing another pirate inside did they realize it was human-operated.

Excavators, bulldozers, small dump trucks racing back and forth—mechanized construction's impact was overwhelming. By comparison, shoveling soil by hand, carrying it bucket by bucket—they were hardly better than ants.

With Wu De this fearsome presence, plus Young Yuan as his vicious enforcer, no one dared slack. The prisoners worked zealously. After half a day together, they realized this Overseer Wu, despite his terrifying expression, was far better than the youth who enjoyed beating them.

At evening quitting time, Wu De led them to a separate shelter—within the watchtower's surveillance zone, the compound surrounded by barbed wire. No need to worry about escapes. Hippo waited there with a medical kit. Based on midday's examination, he needed to treat these laborers. After forcing them to bathe again and boil their clothes, all five stood naked before Hippo. Hippo took a ladle and poured slightly hot water over them, then scrubbed them hard with some unknown grass brush. The five didn't dare even whimper.

"What are you doing?"

"Treating scabies infection. This opens the infected areas for medication." Hippo explained, forcefully rubbing ointment onto the skin with gauze.

"Sulfur ointment—I'd forgotten about this until Director Wen reminded me." Hippo rubbed vigorously. "In the 21st century, scabies infection is rare."

"Also—" Hippo applied more ointments. "Don't let them bathe for a few days until this course is finished."

"Hard to treat?"

"Very easy, but this thing spreads by skin contact—annoying." Hippo himself was fully protected.

"Should I apply some too?" Wu De was a bit worried. This thing seemed very itchy—he'd seen these men scratching desperately all day.

"No need—just bathe and change clothes. Avoid skin contact with them. Oh, and the straw they sleep on—burn it every day."

After all this, Hippo made them swallow a bunch of small pills. Though suspicious of the small white tablets, under Wu De's pressure they swallowed everything.

"Pity I don't know traditional medicine or recognize herbs." Hippo shook his head. "I recall there were deworming prescriptions too."

"Fu Youdi."

"Here!" After an afternoon of conditioning, everyone responded quickly to roll call now—and understood a bit of what the pirate overseer said. The price was welted buttocks.

"You're team captain." Wu De's reasoning was simple—he wasn't suitable. This native-born farmer wasn't strong, wasn't clever, could barely speak coherently. As captain, he'd definitely lack respect. And that was exactly the effect Wu De wanted.

"Me?" Fu Youdi was still confused.

"Yes. From now on, you're responsible for meal distribution and work assignments. Any problems—you answer for them!"

Wu Nanhai had originally allocated portions according to transmigrator standards—200 grams of rice per main meal—about right for heavy labor. But Wu De didn't intend to let them eat their fill. In his view, being full should be a reward, not given lightly. He told Wu Nanhai to halve it.

"Will that be enough?..." Wu Nanhai said doubtfully.

"That's exactly the point—not enough is better. People who are full tend to overthink."

"Not really—when I'm full I just want to nap..."

"That's you. Add water. Yes, more water—make it seafood porridge."

When Young Yuan brought the porridge in a wooden bucket, the rice had become a bucketful of thin gruel. Yet even so, when the lid came off, the prisoners stared: snow-white rice porridge, with so much fish and shellfish floating in it, fragrant... Though Lingao was coastal, common folk rarely had fresh fish. At most, during the three busy farming seasons, a landlord might steam a morsel of stinking salted fish. If not thoroughly terrified by Wu De already, they'd have pounced.

They were issued rough wooden bowls and chopsticks from who-knows-where. Meal distribution was now the newly appointed captain's job.

"Anyone causes trouble during meals—not only no food that meal, but no food all the next day!" Wu De dropped this threat and walked off. He knew: even the most timid person, once given leadership's backing, would grow presumptuous—especially over something as vital as food.
