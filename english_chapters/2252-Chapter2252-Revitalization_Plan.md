# Chapter 2252: Revitalization Plan

In the courtyard of the Dragon Mother Temple, many baskets, straw bags, and carrying poles were piled up, and there were grains of grain in the cracks of the stone slabs. It looked no different from an ordinary courtyard for storing grain, except for several large pools of blood on the ground and steps, which were shocking to the eye.

Inside the various rooms of the temple, grain, cloth, and all sorts of wealth were piled up—a mishmash including everything from goods of the town's shops in the past to items he had looted or forcibly requisitioned. Bales and bundles were stacked in complete disorder.

"We've struck it rich this time," Luo Yiming said happily. "The county is poor and blank. Now that we have these spoils of war, it will be much more convenient to carry out work in the future."

At present, they were in such difficulty that even the grain and pay for the National Army squad had to be supplied by logistics; they couldn't even produce the money and grain to expand their forces locally. With Sun Dabiao’s things, many things they wanted to do but couldn't could be solved.

Bi Da was not as excited as he was. Sun Dabiao’s things seemed like a lot, but placed against the expenses of the entire county, it was actually not much. She still remembered what the teacher had said in class: temporary income like captured goods and confiscations, while able to bring sudden wealth and solve many problems, did not last long; local finance still had to rely on long-term income streams like taxation which flowed slowly but continuously.

Solving Sun Dabiao certainly removed a harm, consolidated the Yao area, and deterred the wealthy magnates in the county, but the public security in the county had not yet improved for the time being. Feng Haijiao and Yang Tianyi’s men were still active in the county. After this battle, the enemy’s vigilance would undoubtedly increase, and it was hard to say how long the Mountain Company could stay here.

Bi Da knew clearly that this complete victory relied entirely on the combat prowess of the Mountain Company. Without this sharp knife, even if she had three National Army squads, she would not dare to implement this plan.

Once the Mountain Company was transferred away, the military pressure on the county would increase steeply.

"Inventory and register the items first," Bi Da said. "Then slowly transport them into the county seat. Do not move ordinary commercial goods other than cloth—we still need to restore local commerce."

The last place to see was the "Ticket House." A side hall with two wings confined more than seventy "tickets," separated by gender, ranging in age from octogenarians to toddlers. They were all dressed in rags, with disheveled hair and dirty faces. Many had suffered torture and could only lie groaning on the filthy ground. Seeing "officials" approaching, anyone who could move knelt down.

"Old... Lord..." Although the leading elder was dressed in rags and looked listless, judging by the material of his clothes, he was a wealthy man. "This small one..."

"Alright, everyone get up," Bi Da said. "I am the County Magistrate of this county..."

At this, everyone in the Ticket House widened their eyes. Even those who couldn't get up raised their heads to look at the young woman before them.

"You have all suffered!" Bi Da said. "In a while, we will send everyone to the county seat first. Once inside the county seat, we will treat your injuries, then send you back to your respective homes one by one. For now, please rest here for a moment and do not walk around at will—the remnants of the bandits are still being cleared outside."

These few sentences were spoken clearly and plainly, without any out-of-tune "bureaucratic tone." The group of "tickets" was both surprised and overjoyed. Surprised that the Australians would send a young girl to be the magistrate, and overjoyed that they had finally escaped the sea of bitterness—some had been detained here for more than half a year. Most were local wealthy households; the poorest were owner-farmers. Once here, the men were used as slaves to do hard labor; for the women, the attractive ones were used by the bandits to vent their lust, while the ugly and old were driven to do hard work. To urge their families to send money sooner, they were tortured every few days. Some were tortured to death because their families couldn't produce the ransom, and there were also those who committed suicide unable to bear the torment. Although the others were still alive, they were all muddled, taking one day at a time.

"Many thanks, Old... Lord..." The leading old man was overjoyed and hurriedly kowtowed. "This small commoner will never forget the Lord's grace..."

This immediately drew a chorus of gratitude. The sound of kowtowing rose and fell.

"Alright, alright, you rest first. If you need anything, speak to the soldiers here," Bi Da said. "We will satisfy it if we can."

The battlefield cleanup did not declare a complete end until noon. In the entire Battle of Dalang Market, more than two hundred bandits were killed, and three hundred and thirty-eight bandits and bandit family members were captured. One hundred and twenty-seven commoners abducted by the bandits were rescued. The county government side only had five deaths in total, with another seventeen wounded; it could be called a complete victory.

Captured grain amounted to one thousand one hundred *shi*, salt four hundred *shi*, silk, satin, and various cloths two thousand bolts, various hides three hundred and fifty sheets, medicinal materials five thousand *jin*, and various sundries twenty thousand *jin*. One thousand three hundred taels of silver, eighty taels of gold, and three thousand strings of copper coins were recovered.

"This money is obviously not the entire wealth of Sun Dabiao and the others."

"Naturally," Bi Da said. "We will slowly force it out of him."

Just as they were speaking, someone came to report, "Magistrate, the battlefield cleanup inside Dalang Market is complete."

"How were the corpses handled?"

"Prisoners are being called to dig ditches."

"Don't dig ditches," Bi Da took a deep breath. "Pass on my order: bury these bandit corpses separately on both sides of the main road at the entrance of Dalang Market. The graves don't need to be too deep, but the mounds must be piled high—three meters, let's say."

Zhen Huan asked in confusion, "This... what's the use of building grave mounds..."

Luo Yiming didn't understand either. But since the Magistrate's order had been given, they would just execute it—he had originally been a bit worried, fearing a young woman couldn't shoulder this burden, but at this moment he was completely convinced by her.

This battle was fought crisply and neatly. Not only was Sun Dabiao’s gang totally annihilated, but Sun Dabiao’s entire family was also captured alive, and Zhang Tianbo was killed. Two of the Three Tyrants of Yangshan were declared destroyed. A large batch of bandit leaders and old bandits were either killed or captured alive. When the news was sent back to the county seat, the gray haze of low morale among the garrison and cadres was instantly swept away. You Ciren could not suppress the joy in his heart and immediately ordered the rear cannon on the city wall to fire three times. Peng Shou’an was so surprised he tugged straight at his beard: *This Li barbarian girl really has ability!* When he heard that Bi Da had buried the killed bandits on both sides of the road and piled up large earthen mounds to dispose of them, he was secretly even more startled: *This is piling up a Jingguan (Spectacle)! To think this Li barbarian woman actually knows of this!*

"Magistrate Zhen has further instructions," the messenger who returned gasped for breath. "One, have Pan Tianshun immediately return to Yonghua to recruit one hundred able-bodied men; Two, select four strong-squad yamen runners skilled in torture and the county executioner from the retained yamen personnel in the county, bring their tools, and rush to Dalang Market immediately for employment; Three, the county is to dispatch three hundred militia, bring plenty of carrying poles, baskets, and wheelbarrows, to arrive at Dalang Market tomorrow morning to transport war booty; Four, proclaim to the whole county: Dalang Market has been recovered. Original residents of the market or commoners willing to move to Dalang Market can all come to settle in Dalang Market. The county government will provide protection, issue settlement fees and free homesteads, and help them build houses. Merchants willing to come will be allocated shop homesteads for free. Exemption from all taxes."

"People are easy to talk about, but the county's strength is empty. Sending another three hundred militia on the road..." You Ciren hesitated a little because the militia still needed people to escort them. The county's military strength, counted fully, was only a few dozen men.

"The Magistrate has already sent a platoon of Mountain Company soldiers back first; they will arrive at the county seat before noon."

Hearing that the Li-Miao Company was returning, You Ciren’s worries vanished entirely. "Good, I will go arrange it right away!"

"Right,"

Because it was decided to stay here and work for some days, the National Army squad and the Mountain Company worked together to first renovate and reinforce three courtyards. The original mountain goods shop served as the "Agency" location. The Dragon Mother Temple continued to serve as the "Warehouse," and another building was converted into the garrison for the stationed National Army.

The debris around the three buildings was completely cleared away, partly to utilize building materials, and partly to clear the fields of fire between the various large compounds.

Bi Da instructed that the ground scorched by fire be leveled, the roads inside Dalang Market be paved with bricks and stones, and drainage ditches dug. She also sent people to clear all the water wells; any corpses or debris were fished out, and the water was bailed clean. She also ordered people to build sheds on both sides of the road using the remaining wood, reed mats, and other building materials from the fire.

"Magistrate, you are planning to..." Luo Yiming increasingly couldn't understand this magistrate.

"We are just setting up shop to do business here," Bi Da laughed. "Sun Dabiao said he would rather give his wife to Wang Chuyi than hand over this territory. Now that we occupy it, how can we let it go to waste in vain?"

Luo Yiming understood now and laughed too. He said, "I understand! The Magistrate truly has stratagems in her chest."

Zhen Huan saw them talking and laughing, yet treating him with icy frost, and felt very disappointed in his heart. He said, "Now the county is not peaceful. Who will come here to do business!"

"Exactly because the county is not peaceful, we can do exclusive business. These salt, cloth, and sundries are all urgently needed commodities in the Yao area—the Yao people of Yonghua, no matter how much they hated Sun Dabiao in the past, still had to come here to buy. We can do this business too," Bi Da said. "These several hundred *shi* of salt, plus this much miscellaneous goods, were originally commodities prepared for sale to the Yao area. There is no need for us to transport them back. Selling them on the spot can stabilize the hearts of the Yonghua Yao people and also acquire materials from the Yao area—transferring the materials to the rear can also lighten the Senate's war burden. Everyone is in difficulty right now."

"Truly considerate! Thinking of the Senate everywhere. Truly closer than a daughter..." Luo Yiming joked.

"I am the Senate's daughter," Bi Da said.

Luo Yiming was an old naturalized citizen and understood the burning emotion of "grace of reinvention" towards the Senate among many naturalized citizens, but they rarely expressed it so frankly and directly in front of outsiders alone.

On this side, the cadre responsible for screening and registering prisoner situations came to report: The prisoners had all been screened and registered. The commoners mixed in who had been forced to become bandits were also identified under the identification of the "tickets" and commoners; the rest were confirmed bandits. They were registered separately according to status and magnitude of crimes.
