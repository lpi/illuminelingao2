# Chapter 56: The Ribbon-Cutting

He had no good solution for the roof—no tiles, no planks. Though he'd requested tarpaulin, the Planning Committee rejected it. So back to waste utilization: woven branch lattice as covering. Fresh greenery crowned the building—pure natural style. It looked rather like something from a domestic eco-park. Of course, this all-natural-materials latrine had basically zero wind and rain resistance. Fortunately, after Mid-Autumn, Lingao entered dry season—little rain, no typhoons. It would suffice for now. The final step: painting large "MEN" and "WOMEN" signs on the doors.

The Building Group circled the newly completed latrine several times, genuinely moved. Though its structure was crude and its purpose humble—in the 21st century, even beggars might pass it by—it was the first building the transmigrators had created with their own hands. A milestone achievement. Even a floating drum dock got a monument; this building had greater significance—at minimum, a "Historic Site of Crossing Landing Base Latrine" stone was warranted. While they hotly debated the inscription, Mei Wan proposed: theoretically, such a public-welfare building deserved a Committee member to cut the ribbon and formally open it. Tian Jiujiu enthusiastically supported this—after all, the latrine was his work. So Mei Wan called the Committee, requesting a latrine completion ceremony: "It concerns livelihoods and the fundamental interests of the crossing masses. You figure it out."

After phoning from the beach telephone station, Mei Wan thought: if there's to be a ceremony, the latrine shouldn't stink to high heaven—that wouldn't do for leadership and media. On grounds of "holding a major public event," he requested two militiamen from Acting Military Group Leader He Ming for "guard duty"—specifying they needn't be elite, just regular militia. He Ming was an old soldier; hearing about a major public event with Committee leadership attending, he immediately assigned two young recruits to the Building Engineering Group. Thus Ye Mengyan and Wei Aiwen—neither actual military, but the most enthusiastic young trainees—received his order:

"Immediately present yourselves properly—rifles with bayonets fixed! Double-time to Red Beach Building Engineering Group, report for special guard duty!" This command thrilled the two young men who'd been standing guard tediously all day. They quickly washed up and reported.

Mei Wan was delighted to see these energetic young men with SKS rifles and gleaming bayonets. He posted them at the latrine entrance: no one allowed in to use it.

"Without Committee orders, no one enters!" he specially emphasized. "This is an important mission—execute conscientiously!"

Ye Mengyan and Wei Aiwen exchanged confused looks: guarding a latrine—what kind of important mission was this?

"Important mission my ass. A latrine you can't use—why build it?" Wei Aiwen was somewhat indignant. Before crossing, he'd played cards and hung out with many Committee members, assuming he'd get some minor position afterward. Instead, his first day was guard duty with a pimply-faced teenager—and now latrine guard!

"There's a ribbon-cutting ceremony soon. Can't have it reeking, can we?"

"What the—a latrine that doesn't reek, does it smell like flowers instead?" Wei Aiwen propped his rifle against the wall. "Does the Committee even control when people piss and shit? I'm going in first."

Ye Mengyan wore an impatient expression, already annoyed, and now these two were arguing. "What's all the fuss? Do it already. Guard duty there, guard duty here—what's the difference!"

"This young comrade has insight," Mei Wan praised. He also promised they could come to the Engineering tent that night to watch "good-boy movies"—only then was the work settled.

While they wrangled over the guard posting at the latrine, on the ship's poop deck the Committee was dodging responsibility for who'd attend. Everyone liked showing their face—but showing it this way felt awkwardly indescribable. Yet not going seemed too dismissive of the masses' interests. Finally, Xiao Zishan—who nominally oversaw internal affairs and livelihood—couldn't refuse and went.

A crowd had gathered at the latrine entrance. Clearly, this kind of practical project won popular support. Xiao Zishan had just smiled and waved at them when he was drowned out by cursing:

"F*** off! Acting all fancy—building a latrine and not letting people use it!"

"This is too damn bureaucratic! We can't piss until the big shots come?"

"I need to shit..." Someone moaned in agony.

...

Xiao Zishan's expression soured. Two guards with SKS rifles and gleaming bayonets stood at the latrine door—what kind of show was this?

"Commissioner Xiao, look this way!" Ding Ding held a DV camera, perched in the raised bucket of an excavator specially brought over, continuing his ongoing coverage. Clearly, this ribbon-cutting was up his alley. He'd rushed over the moment he heard. In his view, the guards and the vine-ribbon were nice but too plain—lacking liveliness, especially ribbon-presenting beauties. So ten minutes later, Li Xiaolü, returning from surveying, found herself inexplicably squeezed into an ill-fitting qipao alongside Panlin—Ding Ding's foreign girlfriend's full name—serving as ceremony hostesses.

The moment the curvaceous Panlin appeared in a tightly wrapped, high-slit qipao, the crowd's focus shifted. Those needing to relieve themselves rushed off to do so, then hurried back to reclaim their spots. If the Engineering Group hadn't intervened, someone would have climbed onto the latrine roof.

In Ding Ding's plan, Panlin served as both hostess and reporter—per his vision, all this footage would be collected to news-documentary standards as important future historical material.

Panlin spoke excellent Chinese, almost without the tonal-flattening common to foreigners. People were willing to cooperate when she held the recorder. Ding Ding himself operated the DV, first shooting several crowd interviews. People expressed that this project greatly facilitated their toilet needs and improved base sanitation. In the interview, Shao Zong from the Logging Group said emotionally: "Before, we had no latrines—we could only squat precariously on swaying decks. Dangerous and polluting. Now the Committee thinks what the masses think, worries what they worry, promptly building this project that warms the people's hearts. We broad crossing masses see it in our eyes, feel it in our hearts. On behalf of all masses, I thank the Committee and the Engineering Group comrades!"

Next, the recorder turned to Ye Mengyan at the entrance, asking his thoughts. Xiao Ye stared at the snowy cleavage in the qipao's open collar, head spinning, babbling incoherently. Ding Ding figured he'd have to dub this segment later. Besides his girlfriend, he couldn't get anyone else assigned—no one to hold cue cards. At this rate, interview quality wouldn't improve. He'd have to talk to the Committee.

Finally, the ribbon-cutting concluded harmoniously—though there was some trouble actually cutting the vine. The thing was remarkably tough; Xiao Zishan struggled quite a while to get through it.

Before leaving, the sweating Xiao Zishan suddenly remembered something. He instructed the Engineering Group to erect a large bulletin board at the latrine entrance for posting notices—walkie-talkies might run out of power, but people would always come to the latrine.

Near the beacon tower, in a clearing of sparse woods, the camp medical station had been established. The Medical Department had high priority; the clinic was built almost immediately after Landing Command. As soon as wired power came ashore, an independent power line was run here—though for now they didn't need electricity.

Several large canvas tents formed the outpatient department. For now, serious cases would still go back to the *Fengcheng*—conditions aboard were far better. Looking out the tent windows, the trees deliberately left uncut and the nearby stream made a beautiful scene—good for patients' morale!

At the outpatient entrance, a bamboo pole had been erected. Health Group Chief Shi Niaoren raised a Red Cross flag.

Other Health Group personnel were inventorying the daily supplies they'd received: mainly surgical instruments (orthopedic and general surgery), dressings, glucose solution, saline, and some common medications.

While inventorying, the clinic received: 4 heatstroke cases, 5 diarrhea cases, 2 upper respiratory infections. One was a lazy fellow who'd slept in a lifeboat overnight without a sleeping bag—now running a fever. Hema squatted nearby taking his temperature.

"39.4°C—that's fierce." Hema checked the thermometer. "Take him to the ship's infirmary."

"Upper respiratory?" Zhang Ziyi was filling out medical charts. She was the wife of Dr. Yang Baogui. Though Dr. Yang also belonged to the Health Department, he didn't work here—he was a veterinarian, currently busy tending the animals in the deck livestock containers, including the five dogs he'd brought himself.

"Just this one, luckily. Weather helped." Hema packed his medical kit. "What worries me are post-landing issues. I discussed this with Dr. Shi last night—he's an infectious-disease specialist. Hainan has quite a few infectious diseases: malaria, cholera are common, and there are parasites..."

The Health Group held a brief meeting to discuss future priorities. Afterward, Shi Niaoren drafted "Disease Prevention Recommendations" for the Committee:

1. Urgently identify traditional Chinese medicine talent (including potentially useful locals) to maintain transmigrators' health while conserving modern medications.

2. Modern drugs must be strictly conserved. Antibiotics should be reserved for post-surgical patients.

3. Establish health monitoring for the population; at the first sign of infectious disease, immediately quarantine.

4. Travelers must not casually eat wild game or fruit; such items must first go to the clinic for inspection.

5. Ensure water purification.

6. Survey local health conditions and gather firsthand statistics.

7. Establish enforceable Health Department regulations.

8. Strengthen camp sanitation management; all household waste must be buried deep.
