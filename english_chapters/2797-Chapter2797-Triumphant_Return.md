# Chapter 2797: Triumphant Return

When Tan Shuangxi finally stepped onto the land he thought of day and night, it was not excitement, joy, or any other agitated mood, but restlessness after being roasted under the sun for an hour.

Although Bopu was not a fine harbor, as the outer port of Lingao and convenient waterway directly connecting directly to Bairen and the County Seat, this better-than-nothing river mouth port had been greatly expanded compared to later generations.

 According to Ma Qianzhu's view, Bopu's current scale and the Senate's investment in it already belonged to "very uneconomic." In order to adapt to constantly expanding shipping requirements, two dredging ships were specially built to dredge the anchorage, and a grand artificial breakwater according to 17th-century standards was built. As for facilities constantly expanding in the port area, the cost was huge.

From a geographical perspective, limited to Lingao County locally, Hou Shui Bay located in the northwest of the county territory was the more suitable port. However, the inertia of development and the water shortage problem existing in the northwest of the county made Bopu still the busiest commercial port in Lingao locally up to now.

Thus, the congestion level of Bopu could be seen.

The fleet transporting a battalion back enjoyed "priority," having berths arranged early on. But because the unloading site was too small and accompanying military baggage too much, chaos was still caused, causing severe traffic congestion.

Sergeants shouted back and forth in the crowd to organize troops. With great difficulty, the whole battalion finished lining up and roll call at the wharf, only then proceeding to the "Temporary Transit Camp" under the lead of wharf staff.

The Temporary Transit Camp was the original "Quarantine Camp." Because Lingao's status became more and more important, immigrant quarantine from the mainland to Hainan had been uniformly changed to be conducted in Haikou. This huge camp only retained a small part as "Crew and Merchant Quarantine." The remaining part became a military transit camp, serving as a temporary station for military personnel and materials departing from and returning to Bopu.

Although the army wasn't satisfied with this place, and Qian Shuiting also had quite some complaints about the army occupying such a large piece of land in Bopu where inch of land was inch of gold, no more suitable location could be found nearby.

In the transit camp, soldiers carried out simple washing. Regardless of whether you washed your face on the ship, all washed again. Soldiers had haircut, bath, and shaved beard during the small rest and reorganization before boarding, but after drifting for several days, beards grew back. Especially individual soldiers with whiskers were all pulled out by Joint Logistics officers to shave beards.

Tan Shuangxi washed his face while cursing being sunned for half a day in vain. But the fresh water used openly and steaming tea still restored his spirit.

"Attention! All change to service uniform!"

With the Battalion Headquarters messenger delivering orders, soldiers hurriedly took off backpacks and took out service uniforms from inside.

The service uniform was still the set issued when they departed from Hainan. This set of service uniform, except for wearing once during the expedition, and wearing a few times when holding military reviews and other military ceremonies in Chaozhou, basically hadn't been moved, stored with large baggage in the Joint Logistics station in Chaoshan area all along. So preservation was quite good, unlike combat uniforms, namely old Year One Type, which had been changed for unknown how many sets.

After organizing appearance and changing into service uniforms, soldiers who were originally somewhat untidy one by one appeared mighty and capable again. What the General Staff wanted was this effect.

"Unfurl military flags!" With the order issued, battalion and company military flags were all taken out from protective covers and unfurled. Red Iron Fist Military Flags and Blue Morning Star Flags fluttered in the breeze.

"Whole battalion form two-column marching column, advance in sequence!"

As drummers and fifers played brisk marching tunes, the 1st Infantry Battalion lined up to walk out of the transit camp, leaving Bopu Port, walking along the highway towards the direction of Bairen.

Accompanied by the sound of military drums, soldiers marched on the highway with brisk steps. The weather was very good. Wenlan River waves sparkled. From time to time a train of barges towed by Daihatsu boats passed on the river surface. Sailors seeing the team sounded the steam whistle. Some active soldiers also took off military caps to wave at Daihatsu boats, often bringing longer steam whistles. Farmers working in fields straightened their waists, took off straw hats on heads to fan wind, watching the long queue. Some bold ones shouted at the team: "Are you coming back from the north?" Immediately someone in the team answered: "Yes, we fought to Guilin."

To Tan Shuangxi and comrades around, the scene before eyes was both familiar and strange. He liked the life of being a soldier, tense yet full, exciting and with a sense of achievement. But this time, he felt the beauty of peaceful life. Field labor that once disgusted him, looked as an onlooker, was so full of warmth.

Ahead, unknown which company started, singing the departure military song. Singing spread from the front of the team.

Tan Shuangxi and soldiers around him also started singing. The joy of returning home and love for this place turned into cheerful singing and spirited eyes.

The team got closer and closer to East Gate Market. A tall colorful arch emerged from the far end of the road. Thick wooden pillars supported a huge plaque, on which were three bright big characters: Arc de Triomphe (Gateway of Triumphant Return).

Under the Arc de Triomphe, welcoming crowds clustered. With their arrival, countless firecrackers sounded on both sides. Then from big loudspeakers sounded the cheerful "When Soldiers Stride Back Home." People lining the street waved flags and fresh flowers. Colored paper scraps and streamers drifted down from roofs on both sides of the road, like a joyous heavy snow.

"Salute!" With a command, officers raised hands to salute, sergeants and soldiers turned heads in unison to perform eyes right.

Police and temporarily seconded National Army soldiers maintained order on both sides of the road, returning salute with the order. Several children in the crowd followed the leading child's shout: "Salute... to... Officers!" Saluting military salutes in various twisted postures together, receiving a burst of cheerful laughter from soldiers.

Why do we fight? For noble titles for wife and protection for children? No. For glory to ancestors? No. For the glory of the Senate? No. It is to protect the life we love, to let more common folks live such a life, to let everyone under heaven live such a life. Tan Shuangxi couldn't understand this complex reasoning before. Now, having experienced life and death on the battlefield, suddenly returning to normal life, he suddenly understood.

On this section of road in the urban area, the team walked very slowly because the crowd was really too large. If not for food safety and order considerations prohibiting crowds from giving food to soldiers, the march would probably be even slower. But even so, there were still many women, children, and elderly crossing the cordon to surge into the team, stuffing handkerchiefs, letters, and various small gifts to them.

Squeezing to Tan Shuangxi's side was an old farmer, grabbing the soldier next to Tan Shuangxi, asking with a tone mixed with anxiety and expectation: "My son is a soldier of the 8th Battalion. Have they withdrawn?"

The 8th Battalion was formed in Lingao. New recruits supplemented during formation mainly came from Danzhou and Lingao. Seeing the 1st Battalion also departing from Lingao returned, naturally thought of the 8th Battalion.

The soldier was dumbfounded; he didn't know where the 8th Battalion was at all.

Tan Shuangxi went forward to relieve the soldier: "Old man, we are troops of the 3rd Mixed Brigade. The 8th Battalion belongs to the 1st Mixed Brigade. Now all battalions are arranging rest and reorganization; estimate they will come back very soon too. You rest assured, the 1st Brigade was in Guangzhou direction. They took Guangzhou almost without firing a shot. Your son definitely can come back safely. You just rest assured waiting for him at home."

The old farmer seemed to have taken a reassurance pill. Anxiety in eyes turned into relief, continuously holding Tan Shuangxi's hand saying thanks. Taking advantage of saluting, Tan Shuangxi quickly pulled out his hand to bid farewell to the old farmer. The 1st Brigade taking Guangzhou indeed didn't pay any price, but later losses were not small during the public security war.

"Brother, you must come back safely." Tan Shuangxi muttered to himself, trotting back into the team.

As the team walked into the bustling street block, people on the street became more and more. Some were students organized by schools, wearing uniform school uniforms, waving fresh flowers and flags. Others were assistants and guests of nearby shops. Not doing business at this moment, standing by the roadside learning students' cheers, cheering in New Language with southern and northern accents. Windows of second and third-floor shops also opened. First extended a Morning Star Flag held by a bamboo pole, then popped out a few smiling faces, and arms waving small flags. Someone was probably over-excited, leaning half body out, almost falling from upstairs, inducing a burst of startled cries from the watching crowd and soldiers.

"Must not fall down. Dying because of this would be too unworthy," Tan Shuangxi couldn't help thinking secretly. On the battlefield, life could be used to measure the value of a hill or a city, but here, life was priceless.

In the welcoming crowd, many people held paper signs with unit designations and names written on them, probing faces of every soldier in the column with anxious eyes, trying to find familiar faces from them. But soldier after soldier walked past, leaving them only anxiety and disappointment.

Probably being recognized as a sergeant, people constantly came up to pull him, inquiring about the situation of so-and-so unit.

At first he hesitated what could be said and what couldn't. Later people gathering around were really too many. Stuttering would only cause greater anxiety to comers, so he had to say everything.

"The team you asked is not of our brigade. They went to Guangxi. We went to Fujian in the end."

"Casualties over at Wuzhou were mainly National Army. Fubo Army casualties were not big. You old man just relax!"

"Plague? We were at the frontline all along. This I really don't know..."

"Fu Sanjin? Which company? People called this name are too many... National Army Battalion? They are not in our sequence..."

"Grenadier Company is just behind. You ask soldiers behind later..."

"Artillery 5th Company? Saw at Shanwei. Ming troops were cowardly; should be fine..."

Suddenly a timid voice inserted: "Brother Shuangxi? Is it really you?!"
