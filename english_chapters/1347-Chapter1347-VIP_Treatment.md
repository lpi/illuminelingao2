# Chapter 1347 - VIP Treatment

This kind of thing had happened more than once. Every time he would send stern inquiries to the Korean side, but with little effect. Sometimes Korea would even refuse to trade, using the excuse that their country didn't produce such goods.

The Yi Dynasty was outwardly submissive but inwardly still looked up to the Southern Court—the intelligence from his spies also said the Yi Dynasty was secretly corresponding with the Southern Court.

He was considering how to give the Yi Dynasty a little lesson, to remind them not to forget the "brotherly alliance" of old, when a clerk from the Board of War delivered an urgent dispatch.

Huang Taiji glanced at the memo slip attached to the dispatch forwarded by the Board of War—it was actually from Zhenjiang Fort, which gave him a start.

Zhenjiang Fort was the hub leading to Korea and a fortress keeping Dongjiang in check—a very crucial location. But it had been a long time since any warnings had come from Zhenjiang Fort. The Dongjiang Army's cross-river raids had disappeared since the Korea campaign. And Dongjiang's current situation made another deep thrust into the Yalu to harass Zhenjiang Fort unlikely.

Huang Taiji watched surrounding developments every day. Compared to the Ming emperor with his specialized secret police apparatus, his information on enemy countries was much more current. This was partly due to generous rewards for spies, partly due to Later Jin's small court being "small." Being small meant fewer links between grassroots and top, with less chance of distortion.

Besides dispatching many spies to Beijing, he had agents at key locations like Dongjiang and Denglai. Dongjiang's internal strife, the Denglai war, and the Beijing court's panicked measures and infighting—every two or three days news would reach Shengjing, first reported secretly to the Board of War's offices, then immediately presented to the palace.

Huang Taiji was very interested in the Denglai Rebellion. In his view, this rebellion had destroyed Sun Yuanhua's years of painstaking work on the Dengzhou new army without him lifting a finger; moreover, with Dongjiang Army so deeply drawn into the rebellion, it would certainly intensify internal Dongjiang splits while increasing the Southern Court's distrust of Dongjiang.

This rebellion was equivalent to removing two major threats to the Eight Banners' flanks without costing him a single soldier. Huang Taiji often felt a sense of "heaven's mandate belongs to me."

Could the Southern Court's realm truly be destined to belong to his Great Jin? Huang Taiji had frequently had such feelings lately.

What news could come from Zhenjiang Fort? He suddenly had a premonition, recalling that his spies had reported a few months ago that Kong Youde and Li Jiucheng had several tens of thousands of followers who had fled Dengzhou by sea. But after fleeing, these forces had disappeared without a trace. The spies' news from Beijing only said government troops had recovered Dengzhou and killed the main rebel leaders Li Jiucheng and Kong Youde, with no explanation of where these tens of thousands who'd fled by sea had gone.

Could this be remnant forces with nowhere else to go, coming to surrender to his Great Jin?! Huang Taiji was secretly delighted. Among these tens of thousands of rebels must be many firearms specialists from the original Dengzhou army—perhaps they'd even bring firearms and warships that the Eight Banners desperately lacked. If so, his army would gain wings.

With such anticipation, he opened the dispatch: it did indeed report "ships coming from the sea," but had nothing to do with Dengzhou remnants. Rather, a strange large ship had come, with people aboard who had shorn hair and short clothes—very peculiar. These people possessed extraordinarily powerful cannon; because the garrison commander had refused them landing, they had already shelled part of Zhenjiang Fort's walls to rubble.

Now they were requesting trade with the court.

"This is strange. Everyone else avoids us; yet people come to our door. They certainly have courage." Huang Taiji gave a slight smile.

Since the other side had come seeking trade, the economically strapped Later Jin court naturally welcomed them.

He immediately ordered two men summoned—Board of War clerks Ding Wensheng and Zhao Fuxing—to inquire about the specific details of this incident.

It turned out that the day after the *Haitian* had anchored, Zhenjiang Fort's garrison had dispatched several hundred men in small boats to raid Tazhi Island, attempting to eliminate the *Haitian* in one stroke. They'd been partially wiped out by cannon from the ship and marines on the island, then fled back. Subsequently the *Haitian* had shelled Zhenjiang Fort, destroying over a dozen *zhang* of wall and killing or wounding about a hundred military and civilian personnel. The cannons' power exceeded even Hongyi cannons.

After taking their beating and knowing they were outmatched, Zhenjiang Fort's commander had obediently sent someone to inquire about the other side's intentions. They learned the visitors called themselves "Great Australia" and wished to trade with the court.

"This Great Australia's ships and cannons are so formidable—how is it we've never heard of them? Where is this country? Did they ever offer tribute to the Southern Court?" Huang Taiji became very interested.

The two clerks spoke in unison, reporting they'd never heard of any Great Australia, let alone their formidable ships and cannons. These two held positions in Later Jin's court because they were well-informed and learned. But racking their brains, searching all geographic texts at hand, they found not half a word about "Great Australia."

Originally they'd been inclined to think this was a group of Ming sea merchants using a foreign banner as cover to trade with Later Jin—sea merchants were mostly lawless types; doing this wouldn't be strange.

But according to the dispatch, the other side's ships and cannons were obviously superior to Ming's, and their soldiers all used muskets and were fierce and skilled fighters. This didn't quite match up with ordinary sea merchants.

"Let it be. Since they've come from afar, their sincerity is praiseworthy. Grant them permission. Order the Board of Rites' Sahalian to immediately arrange the Great Australia envoys' entry to the capital!"

Shortly after this order was issued, a second memorial arrived from Zhenjiang Fort, accompanied by a thick, beautifully printed catalog.

This catalog was the product directory for Later Jin sales. After viewing this catalog, Huang Taiji immediately issued a second order, commanding the Board of Rites to immediately dispatch horses and laborers to transport the envoy mission's cargo. At the same time, have the Board of Rites arrange reception ceremonies and prepare quarters.

Though the other side had kept emphasizing they were just a "trading company," Huang Taiji arranged reception at "envoy mission" standards. For this small Later Jin court already eyeing China proper, this excellent opportunity to demonstrate "foreign vassals paying tribute" and "all seas returning to the heart" certainly couldn't be passed up.

Thus Huang Hua was welcomed to the capital amid this sudden surge of hospitality.

Coming to receive him were Board of Rites clerks and other Later Jin officials, who brought two hundred horses for Huang Hua's entourage to ride and for hauling gifts and goods samples. But Huang Hua's retinue numbered only twenty, and with cargo still didn't need two hundred horses. The remainder were temporarily left at Zhenjiang Fort.

For Huang Hua, they'd prepared a two-mule felt-canopied sedan litter—the most comfortable travel conveyance of the time, with spacious interior allowing sitting or reclining, even carrying beautiful maids or handsome pages for entertainment. It was Huang Hua's first time riding one. Once inside, he found the interior lavishly appointed, even with tea and refreshments provided—utterly thorough.

"These Tartars are really considerate—VIP treatment," Huang Hua muttered to himself amid the thick piles of felt padding. "But I'm not so easily bought."

Before his cart, a bondservant walked on the left driving the mules while a mounted battalion commander in charge of reception rode on the right. The Board of Rites clerks' mule cart followed behind. Around them rode about a hundred Later Jin cavalry. By the banners, he knew these were Bordered Yellow Banner men.

The journey would take many days. Travel was tedious, but he didn't say a word more to the reception officials. Throughout he kept his eyes closed to rest, though his mind never stopped working, considering how to negotiate with Later Jin officials once they reached Shenyang—Shengjing.

The first issue was the question of ritual obeisance. Personally, Huang Hua didn't mind kowtowing—businessmen's integrity had long since shattered; back in the day, accompanying clients to brothels and whores had been just another form of kowtowing. But his current status was envoy. The Council didn't even regard the Ming emperor highly, let alone Later Jin, this little local regime. So kowtowing was absolutely not acceptable.
