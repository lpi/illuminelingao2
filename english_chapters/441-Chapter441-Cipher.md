# Chapter 441 Cipher

Knowing who the specific code names referred to was the key. With this, these materials would become thorough "black materials." Releasing them would have far more lethality than a list of "Three Festivals and Two Birthdays" gift records. Just as an actress adhering to "unspoken rules" is gossip entertainment news, but an actress being raped is a criminal case.

Lin Baiguang believed that Gou Er couldn't have a superhuman memory to remember the person referred to by every code name. Most likely, there should be a cross-reference table between code names and real names as a memo.

However, if Lin Baiguang could think of this, Gou Er naturally could too. As the material sorting gradually came to an end, Sun Xiao still hadn't found the most valuable roster in the account books. Lin Baiguang's face began to look bad: finding valuable material but being unable to use it was too disappointing.

"You don't need to be too disappointed. Maybe Gou Er memorized it himself," Mu Min comforted him. "Or he carries this master copy with him. Besides looking directly for data, we can also use intelligence analysis methods to find out who the code names refer to."

"By cross-referencing the materials, we can generally know where this person is, what specific things they do, and who they contact. We can guess roughly who it is." Mu Min picked up the bribery registry. "The 'Old Man of Lanling' mentioned in the last entry of this booklet received money to intercede with Wu Mingjin for a matter, and the matter was successfully handled. Obviously, this person is an acquaintance close to Wu Mingjin, and the relationship is quite extraordinary."

"I thought of this too," Lin Baiguang said. "But there are quite a few trusted aides around Wu Mingjin—it's hard to confirm exactly who it is. Besides, if it were Assistant Magistrate Wu Ya or an important local member of the gentry interceding, he wouldn't be embarrassed to reject it on the spot."

"So we need to synthesize the materials to look at it. This way we can deduce it."

When they finished clearing the box, they finally found what Lin Baiguang needed: the roster.

When Sun Xiao brought it over, Lin Baiguang was overjoyed. With this thing, he would grab a handful of the "bezoars and dog treasures" inside the bellies of these Qiongzhou Prefecture officials!

Opening it, he immediately went cold halfway. It was indeed a cross-reference table. Each page of the account book was divided into upper and lower columns. The upper column had the person's code name, but the names below were meaningless three-character combinations. Judging by their weirdness, they couldn't possibly be people's real names.

"Damn, this Gou Er is really cunning! This is probably another kind of code!"

Mu Min thought this was likely a kind of cipher, but she knew nothing about it. Through querying the personnel database via computer, they found a cryptography person: Zhang Xingpei.

Zhang Xingpei had just returned from Guangzhou not long ago and was enjoying his vacation—he had received excellent hospitality in Guangzhou: playing with four or five women in one breath. It left him exhausted. After returning to Lingao, he only wanted to cultivate his mind and body. But a phone call summoned him to the Political Security Bureau.

Zhang Xingpei was uneasy, repeatedly thinking over whether he had done anything to wrong the Crossing Group. Could his "lifestyle" issues in Guangzhou have been reported? It seemed the Security Bureau didn't care about such lower-body matters... He couldn't figure it out after much thought, so he had to report for duty.

"Look at these things. Is it a cipher?" Lin Baiguang cut straight to the chase.

Zhang Xingpei had a strong interest in cryptography and intelligence studies and had specially studied them. Of course, his cryptography was only at the most basic entry-level. Hearing he was to work on ciphers gave him a fright—his examples in cryptography were almost all based on the West. He had no concept of what ancient Chinese ciphers were like.

"This is very difficult. I know nothing about ancient Chinese ciphers..." Zhang Xingpei hesitated. "The ancients probably wouldn't use overly complex ciphers, but without knowing the system inside, it's not easy to start."

"The principles should be the same, right?"

"Hard to say," Zhang Xingpei said. "Chinese has eight hundred common characters, while the Western system has dozens of letters—from a coding perspective, letters are obviously much easier than square characters."

The huge difference in writing systems between China and the West created completely different concepts in secret data transmission. Ancient China used more secret slang and argot. Zhang Xingpei knew a little about this kind of slang, which was basically passed down orally and was not the same thing as a cipher at all.

"Hurry and call Luo Duo. Tell him to look up ancient Chinese cryptography materials!"

"It's the middle of the night. Calling people at midnight lacks civic virtue—" Zhang Xingpei was already dissatisfied with being summoned late at night and used the topic to express it.

"Don't worry. This 'two-legged bookcase' is definitely in the Social Work Department office." Lin Baiguang was obviously uninterested in civic virtue, and he was very familiar with Luo Duo's habits—this person's greatest hobby was researching materials; the later at night, the better his spirits.

But the summoned Luo Duo couldn't provide much more material—it was midnight, and he couldn't go to the Grand Library's computer center to search. Based on his limited memory, Zhang Xingpei learned that ancient Chinese military ciphers were mainly of two types: one was "hidden language" similar to *jianghu* slang, but how exactly this hidden language was used could no longer be verified clearly.

Another type was the so-called "word verification" (*ziyan*). This involved compiling forty items for various situations likely encountered in the army, such as: "Request Bows," "Request Arrows," "Request Advance," "Request Reinforcements," etc. Then the communicating parties would agree on a five-character regulated poem with no repeated characters as the "word verification." When writing a letter, the item number of the matter to be reported would correspond to the Nth character in that poem, and marking a small dot next to that character in the letter would suffice. even if the letter fell into enemy hands, and the other side knew this method, as long as the master copy of the item numbers wasn't leaked, knowing which poem it was would be useless.

"...But this method is mainly used for communication. If Gou Er used it for himself just to prevent leaks, it's hard to say if it's this type."

"Actually, it's substituting meaning with characters. Interesting, interesting." Zhang Xingpei fell into deep thought.

Then Luo Duo introduced a cipher invented by Qi Jiguang based on *fanqie* pronunciation—this cipher was already very similar to modern ciphers, but judging by the complexity he described, everyone didn't think Gou Er would use such a complex system. In fact, this cipher was only used briefly in the Qi Family Army and didn't spread widely.

Zhang Xingpei took a pen and copied down the entire account book. One thing was certain now: these nonsensical three-character words referred to people's names. He examined the copy carefully, and a few minutes later, he found a breakthrough.

"I have some idea." Zhang Xingpei pointed at the words above. "This is a simple substitution method, also known as the Caesar cipher."

"When did Gou Er know about Caesar?"

"Of course I'm not saying he used the Caesar cipher, but the principle is about the same." Zhang Xingpei explained: The so-called Caesar cipher simply replaces each letter in the plaintext with a different letter or symbol. According to records: Caesar simply replaced each letter in the plaintext with the letter three places after it.

"But that's unlikely," Luo Duo immediately raised an objection. "How many letters are there? Common Chinese characters number over eight hundred. How large would this character table be? Gou Er would have to carry a codebook as thick as a telegraph codebook at all times."

"I'm not clear on that." Zhang Xingpei shook his head. "But from probability, I can roughly deduce a few surnames."

His line of thought was simple. Since these were all names, the first character of the three-character word must be the surname. Since it was a surname, there was a frequency issue. Just as 'e' is the most frequent letter in English, Chinese surnames also have frequencies. Wang, Zhang, Li, Chen are the most common surnames. Although Zhang Xingpei didn't know the ranking order of Ming dynasty surnames, he assumed it wouldn't differ too much from modern times.

"You have to consider local characteristics," Luo Duo reminded him. "For Lingao, Fu is a major surname. There are many Fujian immigrants here, so the Lin surname is also very common."

"That's the difficult part," Zhang Xingpei said. He singled out the characters representing surnames that appeared most frequently, looking at them repeatedly, but couldn't find a way in.

"This is bad. I have no concept of ancient Chinese books," Zhang Xingpei said dejectedly. "Gou Er definitely used an ancient book. And a very common one—just like how Europeans like to use the Bible as a cipher codebook."

"I think I guessed one." Mu Min suddenly spoke up. "This person who went to Wu Mingjin to intercede for Gou Er's son must be Wang Zhaomin—his private secretary!"

Everyone's gaze turned to her together.

"Look, the first character of the three characters corresponding to this 'Old Man of Lanling' is exactly one of the characters Zhang Xingpei found with the highest frequency: Wang, Zhang, Li, Chen. Add in Fu and Lin. Think about it, among the trusted people around Wu Mingjin, or those who can speak to him, who fits these surnames? Only Wang Zhaomin!"

"Right, right." Lin Baiguang nodded repeatedly. Checking against the data, it didn't seem so unfamiliar anymore.

"Cross-referencing his bribery registry and then checking against the Lingao social situation we've mastered, we should be able to figure out quite a few people's names—fortunately, these are just names, relatively easy to guess."

Other places were hard to say, but the intelligence department had a good grasp of the basic social situation in Lingao. Soon, they found several more people's names from the clues.

"But relying on guessing like this has limited accuracy. And once out of Lingao, this method won't be accurate," Mu Min said. "We still need to find the character table."

"Let me look for it slowly," Zhang Xingpei said. "Since we already know a few characters, we can guess. Let's start looking from the most popular *Hundred Family Surnames*, *Three Character Classic*, and *Thousand Character Classic*—these three, anyone who has studied in the Great Ming can memorize them."
