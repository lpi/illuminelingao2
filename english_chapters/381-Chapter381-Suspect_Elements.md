# Chapter 381 - Suspect Elements

"Why capture them alive? Just kill them and be done with it—avoid future trouble." Lin Chuanqing said.

Gao Xiaosong said: "We need to question them properly—how they came, how many arrived."

*Zhenhai* went to full alert status, beginning a carpet search of Dongsha Island. The other transmigrators aboard found this strange, but Lin Chuanqing only said they'd found signs of pirate activity; for safety they needed a thorough search.

The search naturally produced no results. They even found fishermen's graves overgrown with brush, but no living persons—and no fresh signs of human activity.

Though filled with worry, lingering longer wouldn't yield new discoveries. After completing the guano mining mission, they returned. The unloaded guano immediately sparked a scramble. Under the agriculture-priority policy, most went to the Agricultural Committee. The Chemistry Department got the remainder.

After hearing their report about a possible modern vessel at Dongsha Island, the Executive Committee convened a secret hearing with core and security department heads, briefing them on the situation.

The news shocked everyone. If other wormholes existed and others had also arrived in this time-space, it would pose a major threat to the transmigrator collective. Setting aside everything else, the mystique that made them seem all-powerful would be exposed by such a person. If they'd already pledged allegiance to some local faction, using their modern technology and knowledge in service—the consequences would be unthinkable.

"You're certain it's an American fishing vessel?"

"I didn't say that." Lin Chuanqing said. "I only said: the iron framework above water is very similar to American ocean fishing vessel tripod masts I've seen—almost identical."

"Americans?" Everyone was somewhat alarmed. Could Xue Ziliang and Salina have other companions?

Ma Qianzhu said: "I suggest immediately detaining these two Americans."

"Such panic seems excessive." Ran Yao objected. "The Security Bureau has conducted multiple reviews. Only those two ATF agents came to China to investigate the North American branch—and they entered through airport customs. There's no reason they'd use a fishing boat."

"Could it be another ship from the North American branch?"

"Obviously impossible." Ran Yao said. "No one from North America mentioned such a thing. A ship sinking at Dongsha would be major news—impossible not to mention."

"Something might have happened en route." Ma Qianzhu said meaningfully. "Americans, hmph—the North American branch. Back then, wasn't Shi Niaoren a self-nominated volunteer..."

This comment carried ominous undertones.

"Such suspicion is pointless." Wu De said. "If we could cross the wormhole, perhaps others did too. Why must it connect to our own people?"

Wen Desi said: "Rather than suspecting ourselves first, let's consider the more likely scenario: if people from our same time-space also crossed over, what's our stance?"

"If it's just a few people willing to integrate into our collective and follow all our rules, we can consider acceptance." Wu De said.

"Agreed." Wen Desi said. "If these people have already pledged allegiance to some local faction in this time-space, acceptance is out of the question."

What to do if not accepted—though unspoken, everyone understood the implication. No one objected. Compared to indigenous inhabitants, this group feared people from their own time-space even more. Everyone agreed.

"Alright, I also agree." Ma Qianzhu said. "But if accepting, we must conduct strict political vetting and maintain long-term controlled usage."

"That said, whether these people even exist is still uncertain." Ran Yao said. "We should thoroughly investigate. Someone should immediately go to Dongsha Island, dive down, and conduct a complete survey of the vessel. We might even obtain useful information."

Everyone agreed this news would remain confidential for now. Bai Guoshi, Lin Chuanqing, and Gao Xiaosong were all notified to keep secret. Subsequent matters would be handled entirely by the Political Security Bureau. Ran Yao was immediately authorized to requisition personnel and equipment for an investigation of the suspected Dongsha wreck.

After the meeting, Ma Qianzhu kept Ran Yao behind:

"The Political Security Bureau should conduct an internal investigation." Ma Qianzhu deliberated before finally voicing his opinion.

"You suspect the North American branch people?" The so-called North American branch members were the Qian brothers who came by sailboat, plus Zhou Weisen.

"No—also those who came by airplane." Ma Qianzhu said, standing and pacing his office. "We must be on guard. Once we succeed, this parallel time-space will never have an America. To ensure America's founding in this time-space doesn't disappear, perhaps they've long planned to sabotage our operation..."

Ran Yao was dumbstruck, not knowing what to say. Director Ma's words weren't unreasonable, but the conspiracy theory seemed excessive. Besides, whether America would exist in a parallel time-space—what did that matter to the 21st-century American government?

Ran Yao said carefully: "I think that possibility is very low." He continued: "Among our entire team, returnees from North America are the most numerous. They willingly abandoned everything, bringing families to follow the transmigrator collective to an unfamiliar time-space. They couldn't possibly intend to sabotage our operation—what good would destroying the collective do them? The American government surely can't open another wormhole to bring them back. If we collapse—they perish too."

Ma Qianzhu silently regarded Ran Yao: "Mm, you have a point. But this matter is significant. We can't be careless about our internal personnel either. Better to conduct a review—see if there are any suspicious people or activities."

"Internal investigations require written Executive Committee approval."

"I'll raise it at the next meeting."

Ran Yao returned to his office, carefully considering Ma Qianzhu's words. His concerns weren't unreasonable, but no evidence suggested internal traitors in the transmigrator collective. Rashly launching such an investigation, if leaked, would be like poking a tiger's backside.

After much thought, he decided to use the investigation as an opportunity: have Zhou Weisen join this mission. There was ample justification—he was the only person in the transmigrator collective with a diving certification. Thoroughly investigating this ship required him.

If that ship truly connected to North American branch people, some clues would surely emerge.

Ran Yao called Liu Zheng to immediately draft documents organizing the "Dongsha-Xisha Survey Team." Liu Zheng was puzzled—why was this under Political Security Bureau jurisdiction?

"Honestly, it's just a cover." Ran Yao said. "Handle it through normal mission procedures."

"So do we actually conduct research, or just sail around—"

"Of course. Proper scientific survey. Completely official mission."

"Organizing such an expedition requires Executive Committee authorization."

"No problem." Ran Yao produced documents. "Mission orders are here."

"Alright." Liu Zheng said meaningfully. "You want to designate specific people to go?"

"Bai Guoshi from your department, plus Zhou Weisen—he can dive. I know he's not in your department; issue documents for temporary transfer. Should be no problem."

"Fine." Liu Zheng agreed despite his confusion.

When Zhou Weisen received notice to immediately pack and prepare for departure, he didn't know he'd become an investigation subject. He was in the pharmaceutical factory's biology lab, concentrating on his biological specialty—also the factory's most technically challenging area: vaccine development.

"They want me to join the Dongsha-Xisha Survey Team?" Zhou Weisen was baffled. "I just started my main job—why send me surveying again?"

Being skilled in outdoor activities, familiar with firearms, and experienced in wilderness survival and hunting, he'd been serving as outdoor activities instructor for the Army, Navy, Special Reconnaissance, and Long-Range Reconnaissance teams, also teaching people to dive. Just days ago he'd been transferred to the pharmaceutical factory for biology research. Now suddenly being sent on an expedition perplexed him.

Perplexed or not, a sailing trip to tropical waters seemed fine—at least temporary escape from this tedious work. And from the insatiable Miss Mendoza. Western women were indeed hard to satisfy.

Lin Chuanqing naturally was again assigned as expedition ship captain. This time they used a small 50-ton single-masted lateen vessel also equipped with diesel engine, specifically for marine surveying and short-distance sea transport.

Ran Yao planted one investigator among the indigenous crew and one among the transmigrators. Their task: during the entire investigation, watch for any unusual behavior among expedition members.

As the investigation team prepared to set out, Wu De summoned all village liaisons from near Nanbao to Bairren City. He issued orders to deliver lignite and peat within ten days. Each village received quotas from five to twenty tons based on able-bodied men. Every hundred "heavy *jin*" of lignite or peat could offset one "heavy *jin*" of public grain.

The liaisons looked at each other blankly, wondering what bizarre scheme these Australians were hatching now. What use was that black stuff?

Mining the black coal was easy enough, but transporting so much to Bairren City was quite troublesome. The road from Nanbao to Bairren was difficult to travel. Normally, people didn't even come to the county town without business—let alone transport so much to East Gate Market, even farther than the county. The liaisons all looked troubled, requesting deadline extensions. Wu De knew the Agricultural Committee urgently needed this fertilizer, but understanding the long, difficult road to Bairren, he agreed to some grace period to spare the people's labor.
