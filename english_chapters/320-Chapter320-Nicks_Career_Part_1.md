# Chapter 320 - Nick's Career (Part 1)

In the seed collection room of the farm's biological laboratory, Hu Yicheng held a glass jar full of semen, capped it tightly, and carefully placed it into an enamel pot filled with ice cubes, ready to send it for sperm motility testing in a moment.

Ice cubes were very precious, produced by a freezer. Freezers and refrigerators were super luxury items now; besides those on the *Feng City*, only the Demonstration Farm and Bairen General Hospital had them.

However, this semen was even more precious—it had just been collected from a Tieling draft stallion, likely the only Tieling draft horse in this timeline. The Ministry of Agriculture was preparing to use it to inseminate the mares of the agriculture department to breed the population. Yang Baogui scoffed at letting animals fall in love and mate naturally—such breeding efficiency was too low, so the breeding studs had to enjoy the pleasure of "being milked." For the past few days, everyone in the biological department of the Ministry of Agriculture had been doing this work: first a boar, then a stallion, then a jackass... Currently, only poultry like roosters and drakes escaped this fate. A group of grown men desperately helping animals with the process—not only were the animals depressed, but the men were also depressed.

Starting in spring, Yang Baogui began working tirelessly in the Demonstration Farm to increase the animal population. This was also driven by the situation. The transmigrators' conditions were limited; the semen of various improved livestock stored in liquid nitrogen tanks in the ship's cold storage couldn't be preserved indefinitely. Suitable mothers had to be found for them as soon as possible. Several local yellow cows were already pregnant with Dutch Holstein calves. The days of transmigrators enjoying milk in large quantities were coming soon. Wu Nanhai was experimenting with planting alfalfa and corn on chemically unsuitable highlands to solve the fodder problem.

"Mr. Hu!" Someone shouted outside the laboratory while he was busy. It startled Hu Yicheng. No one here called him "Mr."; usually, it was "Little Hu," "Fox," or natives calling him "Chief" or "Comrade." Calling him "Mr." was probably that Aussie. He went out to look, and sure enough, it was Nick, emanating the usual smell of horse manure.

"Your transfer order!" He stuffed a piece of paper into his hand. Hu Yicheng was a bit confused; he hadn't applied for a transfer. Life on the farm was quite carefree; he wouldn't agree to be stuffed elsewhere!

Opening it, he saw it was a transfer order to the Pharmaceutical Factory. *I don't have a background in pharmaceuticals,* Hu Yicheng thought, stuck between laughter and tears. Fortunately, the Pharmaceutical Factory was also on the farm, so he didn't need to move—he had gotten used to his cozy nest on the farm.

"Where is Da Tie?" "Da Tie" (Big Iron) was the name given by the Agricultural Committee to the stallion of the pair of Tieling draft horses. Naturally, the mare was called "Xiao Tie" (Little Iron).

"In the shed behind, finished." Hu Yicheng stuffed the transfer order into his pocket. He breathed a sigh of relief. On second thought, this pharmaceutical factory was jointly run with the Ministry of Health; maybe there would be plenty of chances to meet nurse girls in the future. Although they were all indigenous girls, after a few months of training and putting on blue nurse uniforms, they looked pretty decent.

After delivering the notice, Nick hurried to check on his horse. "Da Tie" was led out. Having just been milked, the horse showed no signs of fatigue. Seeing Nick arrive, it even snorted excitedly a few times.

He patted Da Tie's neck and checked its body for any injuries before slowly leading it towards the stable.

Walking on the road paved with cinders, looking at the high A-frame roof of the stable in the distance and the horses grazing and drinking on the grass in front of it, Nick felt extremely happy and couldn't help falling into memories:

It happened shortly after the farm was completed. Yang Baogui gathered all the livestock scattered everywhere and drove them to the farm. This included his beloved retired racehorse, Alanchi—Blue Lightning had already died in the chaos of the initial landing. For this, he had secretly shed tears for several nights.

Since handing the horses over to the Agricultural Committee for feeding, he had been constantly worried about them. After Blue Lightning died, he ran to the temporary horse pen every couple of days. Now hearing that the horses had been moved to the farm in Bairen, he hurried over to check.

Under someone's guidance, Nick quickly found the nascent farm. In the crude stable, he saw his treasure and several other horses of various sizes and shapes, as well as Ye Yuming, who was watching them with a troubled look. It was obvious he didn't seem to understand these big guys.

"It was already troubling others. I'm already very happy that you and Mr. Nanhai could find this shelter for them. Thank you very much." As a reward, he took out two boxes totaling 20 bottles of "Ten Drops Water" from his satchel and handed them to him.

"I'm very sorry. Usually, I'd be too embarrassed to offer these things, but this is all I can do right now. These are very effective for preventing and relieving heatstroke; for people working under the scorching sun every day, these will definitely be useful. Also..." He suddenly remembered something and took out several small bags from his luggage bag. "These are soybean seeds, oat grains, millet, corn, and radish seeds I brought. They are essential feed for horses and pigeons. I'm not proficient in farming, so I'll rely on you and Nanhai to plant some for them here."

"This..." Ye Yuming looked troubled. It wasn't that he disliked the trouble or anything, but he knew nothing about raising horses. Wouldn't asking him to take care of these horses be risking their little lives? Yang Baogui had said that horses were very delicate animals.

"Actually, I think you should come and raise the horses specifically," Ye Yuming suggested. "Only Dr. Yang understands a little here, but he is a veterinarian and can't serve the horses every day. You probably wouldn't feel at ease letting others feed them either."

This was true. Among the five hundred or so people, only Nick could be counted as someone who truly knew how to raise horses. "But—" he hesitated, "I agreed with the people from the Military Committee to be their equestrian instructor. To organize cavalry."

"Equestrian instructor?" Ye Yuming said. "What cavalry can you organize with just these few horses? Our key now is to let the mares give birth to more foals to expand the herd, right?"

Nick thought about it and agreed. So he ran to the Executive Committee again. Thus, besides his position as "General Instructor of Cavalry," a new title was added: "General Manager of Horse Husbandry." He spent much more time at the farm than in the New Army. Tirelessly running around for the horses, he was called "Horse Maniac" behind his back by some mean guys.

Nick specifically taking charge of raising horses was exactly what Wu Nanhai wanted—he was worrying about what to do with the pair of Tieling draft horses and two donkeys, let alone the horses captured in battle.

Nick soon discovered the farm was a good place. It had everything and abundant supplies. More importantly, it wasn't chaotic like the beach camp or the main Bairen City. He built himself a plank house next to the horse pen. In most people's view, the location was bad—one could smell horse manure at all times—but opening the rear window allowed him to see the stable. Beside the house, he built a pigeon loft. Among the animals brought on the *Feng City*, only he had brought dozens of pigeons. In the chaos after D-Day, he not only lost a horse but also several pigeons, including a carrier pigeon named "Phoenix Wings," which he guessed had ended up in some glutton's belly. He felt more at ease guarding these little guys himself.

Besides the pair of Tieling draft horses and his Alanchi, there were three captured Dian horses in the stable. He checked the condition of the horses; almost all showed varying degrees of weight loss. Horses are very sensitive animals; adapting to strange environments takes a long time. They hadn't been well taken care of in the interim. Nick's heart ached terribly.

The condition of the three Dian horses was even worse; all had varying degrees of skin disease. Judging from the unique deformities of their hooves, these horses had surprisingly never been shod, indicating they couldn't withstand high-intensity labor. During the transport process of the recent Great Migration, those transmigrators who had no idea how to drive horses had caused severe wear to their hooves on the rugged roads.

For this reason, Nick had to announce the suspension of using horses. While asking Yang Baogui to prepare local medicines to treat the horses' skin diseases, he dug out hoof trimming tools from his luggage—his luggage quota contained quite a few of these items. By candlelight, he trimmed the hooves of these unlucky guys overnight—not only the native horses, but the horses they brought with them hadn't had their hooves scraped since landing.

During the day the next day, he repelled Planning Committee personnel who attempted to commandeer horses for transporting goods. Nick wielded a big stick, declaring that anyone who wanted to take the horses would have to step over his corpse. The nickname "Horse Maniac" spread like wildfire instantly.

At night, he captured someone attempting to steal and eat pigeons. He originally intended to drag him to Ran Yao, but later discovered this person was a high-ranking military leader in the Executive Committee. After the person repeatedly guaranteed to give maximum support to the horse breeding industry, Nick had to release him.

Nick got up early and worked till dark every day. Using a dedicated wheelbarrow for stables he brought himself, he shoveled horse manure and transported horse grass; went to the East Gate Market to find miscellaneous grains suitable for feeding horses; searched everywhere for suitable grazing land. He didn't know how to shoe horses in the past, so he asked Yang Baogui for help. To avoid troubling others, he simply apprenticed himself and learned how to do it. When installing a separate drinking channel for the stable, he ran to the construction department many times and supervised the work on the site day and night. When the supply of miscellaneous grains was most difficult, he even reclaimed a small plot of land himself and asked someone to guide him in planting soybeans and corn.

His professional spirit moved many people. "Horse Maniac" gradually became a nickname with a laudatory color. Everyone admired him: it was truly not easy for someone who used to race horses and live a privileged life in Australia to do this in a place with such arduous material conditions.
