# Chapter 151: Test-Firing

First Army-Navy dispute concluded. More people were eager to see transmigrators' first homemade-firearm's power. Anyone without pressing-work came to watch.

Lin Shenhe temporarily served as artillery-instructor. He demonstrated the complete smoothbore-firing process. By 17th-century Europe, smoothbore-firing had standardized procedures with specialized-equipment. Beyond ammunition, most-essential on gun-carriages were loading-tools. Without them, cannons couldn't fire. In combat, when infantry/cavalry attacked and captured artillery-positions—if time was short and they couldn't drag-away or destroy cannons—they'd destroy loading-tools. Similarly, artillerymen abandoning guns would first take loading-tools: preventing enemies from immediately-using captured-guns; if positions were recaptured, tools meant immediate-firing.

"What the hell kind of thing is this." Ying Yu examined the various long-short wooden-rods with amazement. A retired 130mm-cannon artilleryman—now taught cannon-firing by a kid who'd never served. 

This tool-set was drawn dimension-by-dimension by Lin Shenhe, then jointly-manufactured by Lumber-Factory and Mechanical-Plant. First: bore-sponge—wooden-rod with wool-wrapped tip, wetted to extinguish residual-embers inside bore. Artillery-Group searched databases finding no wool—kapok substituted temporarily. Second: dry-sponge—similar, for drying previous-step's moisture. Third: a coiled iron-hook on wooden-rod cleared possible residual-paper or fiber—contemporary European-cannons used pre-measured powder-bags, paper or flannel-wrapped. Fourth: swelling-headed rammer-rod for tamping powder and projectiles. Finally: a linstock—original was complex; Lin Shenhe simplified it: a captured short-spear wrapped with slow-match.

"Now let's begin test-firing." After several simulated-dry-fires, Lin Shenhe saw everyone basically-mastered the complete-procedure. Time for live-firing.

For test-firing, simplest would be shooting at open-sea. But Bopu's offshore had no reefs or islets—no reference-points for measuring actual-distances. Finally, a wasteland near Lingao-Point was selected as range.

Range had targets: twelve grave-mound-like earthen-piles, three groups, at 400m, 800m, and 1200m. Additionally, a marker-stake at 1500m.

"Report—how do we aim?" Ying Yu had entered artilleryman-role. He suddenly realized his artillery-knowledge was useless for this cannon. How to use barrel-sights, calculate-angles—completely-unknown.

"Use this." Lin Shenhe unloaded a small-briefcase from the limber. Unlike plain wooden-boxes from Bopu Lumber-Factory—clearly ancient, finely-crafted.

"Brought from America—genuine 18th-century artillery measurement-toolkit."

"That badass?" Artillerymen crowded around to see this period-antique.

Inside: something resembling a protractor—two copper-rulers, one long one short, at right-angles, connected by quarter-arc with calibrations. Lin Shenhe explained: this was the "gunner's quadrant"—for measuring cannon-elevation.

He demonstrated: insert long-handle into muzzle, read elevation from plumb-line on arc-scale.

"What's this angle for?" Lin Shenhe said: "Actually, works with firing-tables." He showed a table engraved inside the case-lid—all English, many numbers.

"These are firing-tables—factory test-firing data from pre-shipment trials. For example: using solid-shot, 1-pound charge, 5-degree elevation—how far does projectile travel. This table has not just solid-shot, but HE, shrapnel, and incendiary data."

"Modern-cannons have these too." Ying Yu recalled his 130-cannon's firing-tables.

"Exactly—that's where modern-tables originated. An American I shot cannons with said these appeared as early as 16th-century."

"Shooting-cannons" made several faces display lewd-smirks.

"With firing-tables, gunners just estimate-distance—then know what elevation to set." Lin Shenhe picked up a copper-plate with strings attached.

"This is the 'gunner's square'—period-rangefinder." He explained principles and usage. A simple mathematical-tool using similar-triangles to calculate-distances—trivial for transmigrators with modern-education.

"But—does this matter?" Zhang Bailin asked doubtfully. "We all have binoculars. Binoculars can roughly-estimate distances. We also have specialized-instruments."

"If we're training native-artillery—this works perfectly for them. Simple to make, not hard to use. Losing them isn't heartbreaking."

"This is the 'gunner's rule'—actually a special proportional-scale for calculating powder-charges." Lin Shenhe showed another copper-ruler.

For cannon-propellant, Western artillerists believed ideal-charge was: powder completely-burnt exactly as projectile exited muzzle. Too-early wasted powder. Too-late, bore-friction reduced muzzle-velocity.

This ideal was hard to achieve—but casters constantly experimented for optimal powder-projectile ratios. Since 16th-century, European casters included gunner's-rules with each cannon-batch. Gunners could calculate approximate-charges for different-projectiles.

With these rules, gunners could estimate charge-amounts for various projectile-weights. Saved powder, increased firing-safety, and greatly-improved range-accuracy. This technology was transmitted to China by Western missionaries in 17th-century. Though China allegedly invented firearms earliest—artillery-science research was basically-absent. Powder-projectile ratios were vague; powder-loading was arbitrary. Intense-combat led to excessive-charges, often causing burst-barrels. So gunner's-rules were immediately-treasured as "secret-methods"—many firearms-books either omitted or glossed-over them.

China invented gunpowder and cannons—but not artillery-science. This strange-contradiction made everyone uncomfortable.

"Begin firing."

Without firing-tables, transmigrators started shooting from 0-degree elevation.

First: traditionally-cast cannon. Several people maneuvered the carriage, aiming crude-sights at a mound 400m away.

"This accuracy—" Ying Yu felt like an adult doing kindergarten-games.

Smoothbore-firing had 11 steps. Cold-shot—first two skipped. Powder was Chemistry-Group's granulated captured-blackpowder, rough-paper-wrapped, 250g per-packet.

"Load two packets?"

"Okay, two packets."

6-pound iron-ball rolled into muzzle—no obstruction. Bore-gap was good. Zhang Bailin carefully rammed powder-and-projectile—technical-work, not too-tight, otherwise smoldering without detonation.

Lin Shenhe then pierced powder-bag through touch-hole with long iron-probe, then filled touch-hole with powder.

"Ready to fire!" At his shout, nearby people raised red-flags—warning of imminent-firing.

"Fire!"

"Foreign-slave!" Someone from Navy commented.

At Lin Shenhe's shout, Ying Yu—handling ignition—blew on the slow-match wrapped around his short-spear, brought it to touch-hole. Heart pounding—even first live-fire after basic-training wasn't this nerve-wracking.

Touch-hole powder hissed alight, sprouting half-foot flames like fireworks, crackling. Instantly, cannon lurched backward, belching dense white-smoke and fire with thunderous-roar—a black projectile flew out.

"Banzai!" Navy cheered.

"Traitor! Absolute traitor." Zhang Bailin muttered.

Iron-ball trailed smoke past 400m, smashing solidly into ground—dirt flying with powder-residue.

"Damn powerful." Zhang Bailin's face was ashen. This artillery-maximalist had obviously never witnessed actual cannon-firing. Violent-explosion, recoil-shudder, acrid-powder-smell made the weapon's power palpable. Completely-different from previous miscellaneous-firearms that felt like oversized-firecrackers.

Cannon recoiled several-meters—but barrel and carriage were intact. Ignoring heat and choking-smoke, Lin Shenhe carefully examined the barrel.

"How is it?" Ji Wusheng was worried—cannon-casting was also his first-time.

"Everything normal."

"Don't be careless—check for cracks..." Zhan Wuya reminded. Cast-iron-cannons weren't modern-factory products. "I have a flaw-detector—want to take it back for inspection?"

"Unnecessary." Lin Shenhe thought: too extravagant. "Save the detector for future steel-cannons."

Ying Yu also ran over, face blackened by powder-smoke: "Cannon's okay?"

"Fine—very solid."

"Let's go check the projectile-situation together."
