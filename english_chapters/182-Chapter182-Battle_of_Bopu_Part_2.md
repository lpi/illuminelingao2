# Chapter 182: The Battle of Bopu (Part 2)

Dugu Qiuhun's farm truck blazed down the rough road at 70 kilometers per hour in darkness, horn blaring continuously. Everyone aboard was terrified—afraid they'd become traffic casualties before becoming battle martyrs. Within minutes, searchlight beams ahead swept wildly. Fire flashed intermittently through the darkness amid moving black silhouettes. Combined with shrieking alarms and dense gunfire, it was like a World War II movie.

Just reaching the camp entrance, they saw Meng De in striped sailor shirt and stab-resistant vest, wildly waving an SKS.

"Get to the dock! Enemy's landing there!"

Dugu Qiuhun swung the truck around. Just as he started moving, a burly man ran over—left hand holding a pump-action shotgun, right hand clutching an entrenching tool. Behind him followed a dozen disheveled people, some with guns, some carrying fire extinguishers, all wanting a ride. Dugu waved: Come on, come on! The small farm truck was now packed with over twenty people. Someone screamed—a fire extinguisher had crushed his foot.

"Minor wounds don't leave the front line! Hold on, brother." Wang Ruixiang pounded the cab roof. "Go! Fast boat dock!"

The fast boat dock was already engaged. To reward the North American chapter for shipping large quantities of materiel from the US, their yacht from Hawaii had become private housing. Besides the Qian brothers' families, it also housed tenant Zhou Weisen. At about 100 tons, the yacht had complete living facilities—spacious and comfortable. Always envied. Unexpectedly, being moored too close to the four trawlers made it the first target. Several sampans mistook their objective and attacked here. Arrows and blunderbusses peppered the yacht, leaving the once-pristine white vessel scarred.

A sampan approached, apparently for boarding. Zhou Weisen lay at the cabin hatch, M35 helmet on his head, blasting away with a 12-gauge shotgun. He cleared the sampan of standing men. In the wheelhouse, Qian Shuixie wildly fired his Mosin-Nagant M44. Though he'd rigged a bootleg scope, in this darkness he could only aim by firelight and searchlight beams—basically shooting at silhouettes. The pirates fought back fiercely. Blunderbusses, 2-pounders, and matchlocks crackled back. Wheelhouse glass shattered piece by piece. Qian Shuixie was frantic. Though the brothers' wives and daughters plus Zhou Weisen's Venezuelan girlfriend from Hawaii had been moved to safer camp dormitories at yellow alert, and their weapons and ammunition were sufficient, three men against dozens of pirates was chilling. The whole harbor was searchlights, flames, and gunfire. No friendlies anywhere. A cold dread rose—would this be their glorious end?

While wondering, fire appeared on sampans. A dozen torches flew toward them. Qian Shuiting saw torches landing on the rear wooden deck, catching fire. Critically dangerous! He dropped his SKS, drew a .40-caliber Sig P229 from his belt, grabbed a fire extinguisher and was about to charge out when Zhou Weisen grabbed him, shouting: "I'll go! If you're finished, what about sister-in-law and Beibei?"

"What nonsense at a time like this!" Qian Shuiting saw the rear deck already burning. Just as he struggled to break free, a yellow farm truck burst from darkness. Over twenty men jumped down, firing wildly at the sampans besieging the yacht. Pirates were caught off guard, many falling into the water. Survivors hurriedly rowed away. Several men dragged fire extinguishers from the truck, spraying frantically to extinguish the deck fire.

The three men, still shaken, saw most arrivals were uniformly black-clad with complete stab vests and helmets. Thinking this was some Executive Committee elite unit sent to rescue them, they were moved nearly to tears. About to say something, the leader waved: "You grab weapons too. They're after the trawlers!"

The Qian brothers knew this was the critical moment. They quickly followed. Seeing most arrivals only had machetes, Qian Shuixie feared insufficient firepower. He went below, retrieved three or four Mosin-Nagant M44s from his private stash, and distributed them with ammunition. Everyone had trained on various rifles—at least they wouldn't use them as spears.

En route, they linked up with Bai Yu leading a gun crew and a dozen men, also coming to reinforce the beach and prevent ship damage.

The yacht was only a hundred meters from the trawlers' berth. The beach route was already strewn with bodies and wounded. A sandbag emplacement guarding the dock was unmanned, cannon overturned. Everyone felt increasingly shocked. On the water, many sampans had surrounded the outermost trawler, shadowy figures moving aboard. Just as Dugu Qiuhun raised his gun, Meng De beside him stopped him.

"What are you doing? None of our people are on that ship!"

"You fire and all the equipment is ruined!" Meng De said urgently.

"Cold steel, then." Wang Ruixiang drew his entrenching tool, about to charge.

"Enemy incoming!"

Sampan pirates spotted the reinforcements. Over a dozen sampans beached, disgorging masses of pirates. In firelight, they were dark-skinned, scrawny, with slanted eyes gleaming fiercely, daggers in teeth, Malay-style curved swords in hand.

"Hold fire!" Dugu Qiuhun stopped those about to shoot.

"We want total annihilation. Don't let them escape." His voice was cold. He pulled down his helmet's face shield and adjusted his chengguan stab vest.

*Tweet!* A whistle sounded. Several dozen men formed into formation as trained, three small squares advancing from three directions, pressing toward the enemy.

The enemy seemed unfazed. Clearly trained warriors, they drew swords with crisp sounds, as if saying: Close combat? We're not afraid.

Dugu Qiuhun smiled at their confidence. Idiots, who wants close combat? I'm not shooting so you won't go prone and waste bullets.

50 meters, 40 meters, 30 meters, closer and closer. Their fierce expressions were now visible.

At 20 meters, a wave of the hand. Front-rank fighters quickly parted left and right. Hidden behind the human wall, a 12-pounder mountain howitzer revealed its dark muzzle.

In that instant, the enemy's expressions were clearly visible: astonishment. Their faces seemed to say: Too underhanded!!!

That astonishment lasted less than a second. *BOOM!* The 12-pounder roared. Double canister totaling 24 pounds of iron balls swept through like a storm.

Smoke billowed. Agonized screams. When smoke cleared, of nearly 50 enemies, barely 10 remained standing. Several fled toward the sea, screaming in incomprehensible language, jumping in to escape.

Canister from a howitzer at short range loses energy quickly—beyond 100 meters, it's ineffective. But at 20 meters, it was invincible.

"Beautiful!" Dugu Qiuhun nearly danced with joy.

"Double canister!" Bai Yu yelled. The improvised gun crew, though fumbling, completed reloading in 5 minutes.

This shot targeted beachside sampans. Canister swept the water surface. Several sampans began sinking. More just drifted lifelessly—no living souls remained.

While pirates were stunned, Wang Ruixiang and Dugu Qiuhun—one with hand axe, one with machete—led the charge personally. The mob behind them, as if drugged, howled and surged forward. The fierce battle to retake ships began.

Four trawlers were moored in a row at the pier. Pirates had quickly seized the outermost one, tow cables attached. But they couldn't operate the mechanically controlled anchor chains—couldn't cut them either—and had to raise the anchor manually, delaying their towing.

Wang Ruixiang slashed his way forward with entrenching tool, unstoppable. Blood sprayed everywhere. Those following felt they were watching a cheap horror movie. Actually, he knew no techniques—just relied on being big and nearly invulnerable: chengguan-issue stab-resistant suit, multiple layers of local cotton battle robe, motorcycle helmet, butcher's protective gloves... Like a Qing heavy-armored ironhat soldier. Their sheet-metal blades couldn't hurt him.

In moments, the pier's pirates were cleared. Survivors jumped into the sea, pursued by pump-action and shotgun fire. Dugu Qiuhun, seeing Wang Ruixiang hogging the spotlight, felt competitive. He rushed forward, wanting to be first onto the trawler for a satisfying kill. But the tow cable had parted; in the darkness, ship position was off. His leap's front foot hit the deck but he lost balance, splashing into the sea.

Meanwhile, deck pirates fired arrows wildly and hurled javelins. Many hit transmigrators but none fully penetrated their protection. Wang Ruixiang, at the forefront, had battle robe bristling like a hedgehog. He kept firing. At such close range with pirates clustered, every shot hit at least one. When his revolver emptied and there was no time to reload, a pirate's sword slashed his arm. His arm went numb; the pistol flew. Wang Ruixiang roared, axe severing the attacker's wrist. Another thrust a javelin at his chest. He dodged. The off-balance pirate nearly fell on him. Wang Ruixiang kicked him down, his steel-soled combat boot catching the Malay pirate's temple, snapping his neck vertebrae. Instant death.

Another pirate jumped from behind the wheelhouse, a swim ring slung over his shoulder—perhaps intended as loot. Wang Ruixiang grinned, about to dispatch him, when suddenly the man's head flew off. Arterial blood sprayed, covering Wang Ruixiang head to toe. His helmet was blinded.

"Damn." He cursed, wiping the plexiglass visor with his battle robe sleeve. Dugu Qiuhun stood there holding his machete with an "invincible-and-lonely" expression, soaking wet. He'd climbed aboard from the side after falling in, cut down several men, and finally beheaded this one.

"Good blade. The guy who sold me this gear didn't lie." Dugu Qiuhun's expression was lonely as ever.

"Clear!"

"Clear!"

"Clear!"

Reports of cleared enemies came from all over the deck. Wang Ruixiang, fearing stragglers, inspected all four trawlers. Since cabins had been locked before leaving and response was quick, no pirates had gotten inside. Meng De, worried about instruments, equipment, and tools, breathed with relief.

Bai Yu's team quickly cleared the deck gun positions—the precious fore and aft 70mm breech-loaders were undamaged, just blood-spattered. Meng De hurried to unlock the ammunition compartment with the master key, bringing out shells and powder.

"7 o'clock direction, 750 meters. Armor-piercing, one round!"
