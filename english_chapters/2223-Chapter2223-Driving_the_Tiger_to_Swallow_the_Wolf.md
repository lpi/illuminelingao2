# Chapter 2223 - Driving the Tiger to Swallow the Wolf

"Could it be... you want me to serve as an inside agent?" Zhang Tianbo was frightened. He had only heard storytellers describe such "opening the gates" exploits—invariably life-or-death affairs.

"Nothing so dramatic." Zhan Zhekun soothed him. "You need only carry out the plan as instructed..."

These past few days, Wang Chuyi had been in excellent spirits. First, Yangshan's recovery was progressing smoothly: refugees who had been sheltering in various places had mostly returned to their repaired homes and found livelihoods—the daily distribution of relief grain was steadily decreasing. Second, county roads were now generally open; merchants were once again traveling to and fro. Third—and most gratifying—Sun Dabiao, the greatest destabilizing factor in his view, had finally capitulated in the wake of the supply-convoy ambush. He sent word that he was willing to disband his followers, "wash his hands in a golden basin," and move his household out of Dalang Market. He asked only that the county "protect" his "considerable properties" still in Dalang Market.

This effectively resolved the Sun Dabiao gang. Next came Feng Haijiao—who had been stirring restlessly, even accepting a Ming commission—but he was merely a fish in a pot.

"Tell him: as long as his properties are legitimate businesses, the Council of Elders will protect them all. He need not make special requests." Wang Chuyi said. "As for his residence in Dalang Market—though it will stand empty, it too will be protected."

"Your Honor is benevolent." Zhang Tianbo fawned. "It's just his followers..."

"Didn't I already explain their situation last time? Those who wish to return home—the county will help them settle and start production. Those who don't can be assigned to the National Army Replacement Battalion and later filled into the National Army as soldiers."

Since Sun Dabiao announced his willingness to leave Dalang Market and "wash his hands," he had repeatedly raised the issue of his followers' arrangements. Zhang Tianbo had shuttled back and forth four or five times before things were basically settled.

"Your Honor misunderstands—it's not that matter." Zhang Tianbo was nervous; he swallowed. "Sun Dabiao's men say that he has looked after them for years. They want to honor brotherly loyalty—they can't just quietly disband without ceremony. They want to hold a 'Golden Basin Hand-Washing' assembly. They invite... the County Magistrate... to attend... as witness..."

"Oh, is that it?" Wang Chuyi nodded. This request was somewhat unexpected—but on reflection, it was understandable. When Wang Chuyi was young, peddling goods, he had come to know greenwood folk. He understood that "washing hands in the golden basin" was usually done only "when there was no other choice," and those who did it often met bad ends afterward. Now that Sun Dabiao was withdrawing, his followers naturally felt the chill of "when the hare dies, the hound is stewed." Inviting the County Magistrate was merely a way to get the county's assurance of safety for the rest of their lives.

"This is a weighty matter; I cannot agree immediately," Wang Chuyi said after a pause. "When is it scheduled?"

"Tentatively the twenty-eighth of the seventh month. The weather is hot—not ideal—but Sun Dabiao wants to show his sincerity, so he's rushing."

"Go on. Before then, I will give you an answer."

"Yes, yes."

Wang Chuyi discussed the matter with the county cadres.

Sun Dabiao's willingness to withdraw from Dalang Market was certainly good news for Yangshan's overall situation. The key question was whether this might be a "Hongmen Banquet"—a trap.

His "chief strategist" Peng Shou'an privately judged that Sun Dabiao probably did not dare play tricks—but if Wang Chuyi put himself at risk and anything went wrong, Peng Shou'an would be held accountable. So he adopted a "cautiously opposed" stance.

As for the other naturalized cadres, virtually all opposed. Luo Yiming and You Ciren, who oversaw security, were particularly vocal. Though somewhat skeptical of Sun Dabiao's withdrawal, they acknowledged that given his current situation and strength, he probably had no other options. What they objected to was Wang Chuyi's letting Sun Dabiao off without a "reckoning."

In their view, Sun Dabiao was "drenched in crimes" in Yangshan—notorious among the Han and despised as a tyrant-bandit among the Yao. A thorough reckoning would not only root out this malignancy but also win the hearts of the grassroots populace—both Han and Yao—providing a foundation for future work.

Wang Chuyi's murky dealings with Sun Dabiao—calling it "expediency" while actually giving him a ceremonial "golden basin" exit and a safe landing—would only make him an untouchable liability later. They therefore opposed Wang Chuyi's attending the ceremony to "endorse" Sun Dabiao.

"There's another matter," You Ciren said. "Sun Dabiao and Feng Haijiao have been in close contact. To this day, he has never voluntarily disclosed his relationship with Feng Haijiao. What they're plotting privately—we know nothing. But one thing is clear: Feng Haijiao accepted a Ming commission as *bazong* and is openly recruiting soldiers at Qinglian Market. He clearly intends a showdown with us."

Luo Yiming nodded: "What if Sun Dabiao and Feng Haijiao are secretly in league? County Magistrate Wang, wouldn't you be walking into a trap?"

Wang Chuyi was displeased: "If that's your view, what do you suggest?"

Most believed Sun Dabiao's "golden basin" ceremony should never have been permitted—he should have been crushed outright. But matters had reached this point; they were caught between a rock and a hard place. The naturalized cadres fell silent. It was Peng Shou'an who gently coughed and said: "In this student's view, the County Magistrate need not attend the hand-washing ceremony—that would be over-indulging Sun Dabiao. If the County Magistrate trusts me, I am willing to go in his stead. I imagine Sun Dabiao will not dare complain."

You Ciren said: "Sun Dabiao is counting on the County Magistrate to be his banner. For you to venture alone into the tiger's den—it's not worth it, and not necessary. My advice: simply don't go."

Peng Shou'an wanted to say more, but Wang Chuyi waved him silent: "Nothing ventured, nothing gained. Let Sun Dabiao play his little game—we'll play along. I say we should attend this golden-basin ceremony."

"What?!" Everyone in the meeting room was startled. You Ciren was about to object when Wang Chuyi shook his head: "No need to persuade me—I have my own ideas. The bottom line is: Sun Dabiao wants me to come and endorse him, to guarantee his safety for the rest of his life. Fine—I'll give him that. But he won't get off so easily."

"What does the County Magistrate mean...?" Peng Shou'an asked cautiously.

"Sun Dabiao cares deeply about his followers' futures and worries about his own safety. Fine—we'll do it the greenwood way. At his golden-basin ceremony, we'll have him submit a 'certificate of allegiance.'"

Wang Chuyi's plan was to forbid Sun Dabiao from holding a "golden basin hand-washing"—the reasoning being that it was a greenwood tradition, inappropriate for official purposes. Instead, it would be a "Reorganization Assembly."

Specifically: Sun Dabiao's followers would be reorganized into National Army Provisional Second Squadron, with Sun Dabiao or his nominee as Squadron Commander. Upon reorganization, the entire squadron would immediately march on Qinglian Market to "suppress" Feng Haijiao.

If Sun Dabiao balked, that proved his duplicity—they would seize him on the spot at the "Reorganization Assembly." If he truly led his men to attack, the Provisional Second Squadron would be the vanguard. After a fierce battle, it would inevitably be mauled. Whether or not Sun Dabiao harbored second thoughts, he would no longer be able to stir up trouble. One stone, two birds—eliminating both bandit threats at once.

"...If he's willing to attack and puts real effort into it, we can spare his life and protect his family and property." Wang Chuyi said. "Otherwise, we'll deal with him slowly—once he leaves Dalang Market, he has nothing to rely on."

No one objected to the proposal itself—only to Wang Chuyi's going to Dalang Market for the "Reorganization Assembly." After all, it meant venturing into the tiger's lair.

Wang Chuyi, however, considered it no obstacle.

"What are you all afraid of? I won't go to Dalang Market alone. Since I'm going, I'll naturally bring troops. After the assembly, the troops will take over Dalang Market. Sun Dabiao can have no objections. If he dares act up, we'll eliminate him on the spot!"

His plan: He and You Ciren would lead two squadrons to Dalang Market for the "Reorganization Assembly." One was the Yangshan Provisional Squadron, composed mainly of Yao; the other was the Second Squadron stationed in Yonghua.

With two National Army squadrons present, Sun Dabiao's rabble—fewer than two hundred even with filler—would have to weigh their options carefully before trying anything.

Once reorganization was complete, the Second Squadron would take over Dalang Market. The Provisional Squadron and Sun Dabiao's newly absorbed men would immediately march on Qinglian Market. Luo Yiming would command the First Squadron, remaining in the county seat to handle emergencies.

Using these irregular forces to assault Qinglian Market would be difficult—but given the Provisional Squadron's composition, "keeping an eye on" Sun Dabiao's men was more than sufficient. If those bandits tried anything, the Yonghua Yao who made up the Provisional Squadron would show no mercy.

"...As for the assault on Qinglian Market, I'll notify Elder Huang in advance and request reinforcements. That way, we kill two birds with one stone—dealing with Sun Dabiao's men and destroying Feng Haijiao."

"Brilliant! Truly a plan with no loose ends!" Peng Shou'an could not help but flatter him. "County Magistrate Wang is both a civil administrator who can pacify the realm and a military leader who can secure the nation."

Though partly sycophantic, the sentiment was at least half sincere—the "stratagem" perfectly matched Peng Shou'an's aesthetic sensibilities.

"You flatter me. My thinking has never changed: solve Yangshan's banditry at the lowest possible cost." Wang Chuyi said solemnly. "Now the opportunity is before us. We must seize it."
