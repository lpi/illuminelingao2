# Chapter 171: Capturing Baitu Village

A scout rushed back—reaching Xi Yazhou's horse. Yes—he was the only mounted-officer, riding Nick's beloved "Alanche." This racehorse was indeed magnificent—every native stared admiringly. Hainan rarely had horses—let alone such tall, beautiful ones.

After entering mountain-terrain, he rarely-rode—steep dense-forests meant any ambush would target the only-horseman first. Though Xi Yazhou disliked-walking, self-preservation took-priority.

After 2+ hours gasping uphill, he already-regretted promising Wu Nanhai a-month's free-labor to borrow this horse.

"Commander Xi—Baitu's checkpoint is ahead."

"Confirmed?" Xi Yazhou asked while wiping-sweat.

"Confirmed. Already sent negotiators demanding they open-up."

"Let them keep-talking." Xi Yazhou waved-arm. "All-platoons—rest in-place! I need a-break."

Xiong Buyu had been megaphone-shouting for half-an-hour. The wooden-stockade blocking roadside remained-silent. Road was blocked by thick log-barricade—gate firmly-shut. No visible-figures on stockade-walls—but glinting weapons visible in sunlight.

"Fire—let's try something impressive." Xi Yazhou lowered-binoculars. This wooden-stockade could be taken in 10 minutes.

"Commander Xi—Bei Wei radioed. They've infiltrated behind the stockade—100m away at Hill-41.3. Attack?"

"Just monitor. If we fight everything—these newbies get no-practice."

"Understood."

"All-platoons—prepare for combat! Fix bayonets!"

Following officers' commands, resting-soldiers hurried to stand—forming-up under squad-leaders' urging.

Officers—with orderlies' help—unpacked stab-resistant-vests from backpacks. Too-hot for marching—donned for combat. Rattan-helmets swapped for steel-helmets.

"Fine—give them a-taste of artillery." Ying Yu said resignedly.

First-shot blasted wooden-gate—splinters flying. Two-shots hit the stockade—one blew-off wooden-parapet, another punched clean-through wall.

12-pounder iron-balls trailing smoke-arcs were terrifying. Training-Battalion soldiers cheered their-artillery's might.

Almost-simultaneously—stockade-walls showed white-smoke, cannon-report. Cheering-soldiers suddenly ducked—some dove face-first, hands-over-heads, others prepared fleeing. Formation wavered.

"Good heavens!" Xiong Buyu—though non-officer—had full-equipment, carrying his-beloved flute, planning heroic *Grenadier's March* column-assault. Didn't expect enemy-cannon-fire to throw month-trained Training-Battalion into-chaos.

"Stand fast! Stand fast! Don't panic!" Officers drew-swords, maintaining-order.

"Recruits fear-cannon"—that saying was truth. Xi Yazhou cursed watching his-troops. Returning: must drill them endlessly under-cannon-fire. He mentally-planned.

Old-Tiger You sword-pointed-skyward: "Any bastard looking-back—I'll chop him down! Everyone stand-firm! You worthless-lot!" His-sword-back struck a turning-soldier.

Stockade's cannonball fell under-100m-away. Ying Yu recognized: nothing to fear. Using scrap-iron and rocks as-shot.

"Continue firing!"

Xi Yazhou didn't order immediate-assault. Solid-iron-rounds pounded relentlessly—logs collapsed like toppled-blocks. Entire stockade became rubble-pile—smoking, burning.

Soon people rushed out, waving weapons for melee—but stabilized-infantry's volleys denied them. After first-volley—dozen-plus lay fallen. Survivors screamed-terrified, blood-spattered, fleeing-back.

Xi Yazhou ordered bugle-assault. This time—no embarrassment. Platoons correctly alternated cover-and-advance—quickly entering checkpoint. Ground was littered with bodies crushed by cannon and timber. Soldiers mercilessly bayoneted dying-wounded—screams echoing. Xi Yazhou shook-head: these soldiers had weak fighting-spirit but killed without-hesitation. Good or bad?

Prisoners were ten-to-a-rope. Xiong Buyu hastily-interrogated—almost all Fujianese, fleeing endless-tax-exactions to Hainan. Baitu had sheltered them—paying monthly rice-and-cash. Working as laborers and militia.

Cannons and powder bought from "red-hairs" who came for ship-repairs. Also bought red-hair muskets—but poor-usage caused injuries, so abandoned.

"What damn-times." Xiong Buyu finished-questioning—indignant. "Ming is done—even tiny-villages are raising private-armies."

"Ming is done—but Jurchen aren't much-better." Xi Yazhou sighed. Though dynastic-cycles seemed inevitable—Ming-Qing transition was rare historical-regression. As world approached modern-civilization's threshold—China became brutal-backward slave-state. People impoverished and ignorant. Science destroyed. Culture castrated... Only remaining: Macartney's "China is barbarizing" so-called "prosperous-age."

Xi Yazhou wasn't Ming-fanboy—but even rotten-Ming lacked ugliness of queues. This alone—he couldn't let history repeat.

"Little Wei—take 1st-Company double-timing forward. Reach Baitu quickly—don't enter yet." Xi Yazhou briefed Wei Aiwen. "Seal all land-exits—don't let them escape!"

"Understood!"

"Naval-blockade—*Fubo* should've arrived. Once deployed—fire red-rocket to notify them."

Remaining soldiers cleared-battlefield—bodies tossed into ravines, logs cleared from road. Xi Yazhou noted strategic-terrain—ordered one-platoon guarding-rear. Other units continued toward village.

By 3pm—Baitu surrendered. Village was fortified: wooden-palisades, rammed-earth walls, log-built gun-towers. Remarkably—four-corners had bastions. Looked less like Chinese-village than crude European-fortress. Some attempted sea-escape—*Fubo's* broadsides drove them back. With no-escape and 12-pounder mountain-howitzer smashing one gun-tower—village-surrendered. Ying Yu breathed-relief—ammunition nearly-exhausted.

After detaining surrendering-elders, Xi Yazhou ordered forces to occupy-village. Walking around—he realized this was small-paradise. Houses were simple—but villagers looked healthy, properly-clothed. They showed normal-fear—unlike desperately-poor villages where peasants had dead-fish-eyes.

Village-warehouses and workshops were sealed. Xi Yazhou inspected—soldier-discipline remained-strict, thanks to transmigrator-officers supervising.

Navy-fleet entered harbor—offloading supplies and ammunition. Also arriving: Planning-Committee inventory-staff and Wen Desi himself—as shipbuilding-expert. Baitu's greatest-wealth was its shipyard. They needed evaluating whether Baitu was viable for continued-use—relocating meant abandoning existing-infrastructure.

Shipyard was beachside near bay. Ships on slipways—some incomplete, some under-repair.

After inspection: Baitu's facilities were comprehensive—ironworks, hemp-works, tung-oil-works, paint-works, even small-lime-kiln. But harbor was too-small. Three-sided mountains, 10+-meter water-depth—but entire-harbor accommodated only 8-10 hundred-ton vessels. Village's shipbuilding-capacity matched—only one 400-*liao* ship on slipways, rest were small fishing-boats.

"Nice place." Wen Desi's eyes sparkled seeing such complete ancient-shipbuilding facilities—forgetting his-purpose.

"Too small. Fine as storm-harbor. Too-small for shipyard."

"Somewhat chicken-rib." Wen Desi reluctantly-agreed. Harbor-water was limited; land-space equally-constrained. Current-scale was clearly-maximum.

After deliberation: relocate entire-village. Move women/children/elderly first. Leave some shipwrights to complete slipway-ships. Everything movable—especially quality-timber—transported. Scarce resource for transmigrator shipbuilding.

Xiong Buyu announced to elders: all must relocate to Bopu. There transmigrators would help rebuild shipyard—providing housing and private-plots.

Xi Yazhou didn't give Xiong much-time promoting "New Village" advantages. He sat on camp-stool—brandishing long-saber—glaring menacingly.

"Enough talk. Return—tell villagers: pack-up, prepare for phased-departure!" Bayonet-fixed soldiers behind him added-persuasiveness.

No prolonged-discussion, no political-mobilization needed. Bayonets and cannons were hard-truth. Villagers were ordered to pack—prepare for relocation. Anticipating extended-process, Li Jun with one-platoon would garrison until completion.
