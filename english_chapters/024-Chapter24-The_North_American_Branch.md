# Chapter 24: The North American Branch

With the conclusion of the "First Institutional Conference," the crossing plan finally entered the substantive preparation phase. The specialized groups took responsibility for preparing plans, contingencies, and procurement lists in their respective areas. The number of personnel notified to report also gradually increased.

Each arrival, after registration, had to undergo thirty days of full-time basic military training covering drill, field fortifications, obstacle courses, hand-to-hand combat, and basic survival skills.

After training, based on their abilities and chosen fields, General Affairs would assign them either to specialized groups for planning work or to relevant training courses—with emphasis on practical skills. Zhan Wuya's little machine shop had basically become a vocational school, piled with scrap parts. On the recommendations of various groups, some people were also sent to vocational training schools for short-term skills courses at the Crossing Company's expense.

Former IT elites were now learning to lay bricks and tiles. Former office clerks were learning to operate sewing machines. Many who had never set foot in a workshop now gathered around lathes or workbenches, clumsily learning trades.

Those transmigrators who already had technical jobs, besides being busy with daily documents and meetings, also had to take on training responsibilities.

Wu Nanhai's burden was even greater: he was responsible for turning a group that had never worked the fields into agricultural technicians. Though some transmigrators came from rural family backgrounds, virtually none had actually done farm work. Those who could tell wheat seedlings from chives were already doing well.

One thing was ironclad: everyone living on base, regardless of their work, had to do morning long-distance runs to strengthen their bodies. As Director Wen had instructed: "If we can't fight them, at least we should be able to outrun the natives."

The Athletics Group also organized various military-sport games, held each evening after dinner, as an important means of exercising bodies and reflexes.

Not everyone who came would stay. Some hesitated, changed their minds—after all, society still offered too much worth clinging to for most. Casting oneself into another dimension, gambling on an unknowable future, required enormous courage. Others saw crossing as an opportunity to escape social constraints and do as they pleased; when faced with prolonged training and strict schedules and regulations, they grew impatient and left after a few days.

Those who remained continued their work. Influenced by the fervent excitement of tampering with history—an unprecedented adventure—this group worked almost around the clock drafting all manner of plans and proposals. Every night as Xiao Zishan walked down the corridor, he heard shouting, arguments, and the clatter of keyboards from every office. General Affairs distributed plenty of tea and coffee daily—but no cigarettes; those were a luxury.

The massive organizational and coordination work posed an enormous challenge to the transmigrators' management capabilities. If this were not a group organized for another timespace, the chaos of the early period would have been financially devastating. When Xiao Zishan handed over envelope after envelope of cash "gifts" to the Accounting Section, he felt a pang even knowing this money no longer meant anything to him... when had he ever handled so many cash bribes?

The Executive Committee did not realize at the time what a complex systems-engineering project they had undertaken. The preparations involved tens of thousands of items, many of which only specialists knew the importance of. The complexity of the modern industrial system left Xiao Zishan, who handled many procurement lists each day, in constant amazement.

Fortunately, the IT Group had set up an OA system for the whole organization. This permission-tiered system allowed the Executive Committee to clearly track personnel status, work progress, inventory, and various proposals. Wen Desi's desk was finally free of piles of documents.

Progress on every project was smooth—except for one: athletic equipment, which remained in its original state.

"Athletic equipment," like the front-organization Athletics Group, was code for weapons—especially firearms. Knives, though controlled, still had plenty of legitimate channels. Via internet, one could buy all sorts of blades: from Director Wen's personally purchased 3-yuan Ming-era Japanese-style Northern border-army folding-steel infantry long sword (80cm handle, 120cm blade), to the famous Type 56 three-edged bayonet, to Japanese saber-type bayonets, and Western M9s and D80s—the selection was endless. The choice of which blades to use had sparked many heated debates. But guns were another matter: plenty of people were encyclopedic with data at their fingertips, yet no one had actually obtained a real firearm.

But there's always a golden finger in the world—just as transmigrators always get struck by lightning.

One day, a mysterious visitor arrived at Director Wen's office.

Well, that's not quite accurate. The visitor was a man approaching forty, utterly unremarkable, with an intellectual air, dressed simply but exquisitely. When Xi Yazhou was called into the office, the man was already talking with Wen Desi. The Committee members around them all looked excited.

*A weapons dealer?* Xi Yazhou's guard went up instantly. The Executive Committee had been discussing weapons more than anything else lately. Had they invited such a character themselves? Too reckless! These types were not to be trifled with. He felt a flash of annoyance at Director Wen's carelessness.

"Let me introduce you," Wen Desi noticed Xi Yazhou's expression change. "This is Shi Niaoren. A doctor."

"Hello, Dr. Shi. I'm Xi Yazhou."

"Pleased to meet you!" Shi Niaoren shook hands. "We'll be comrades-in-arms soon." And he burst out laughing.

"Dr. Shi came back from America specifically to join our operation," Wen Desi explained. "He's the helmsman of the North American Branch."

"Don't say that." Shi Niaoren waved his hand. "We have four people total in North America who've committed to the crossing. Xiao Rui even sold his house—he's preparing to buy guns for everyone!"

"Buy guns!" The words gave Xi Yazhou a jolt. He hadn't been very enthusiastic about acquiring firearms, knowing the odds were slim. At most they might source some more five-shots through online channels at high prices. Now someone could directly purchase modern firearms—this wasn't just a step up for the transmigrators' combat capability; it was a leap.

"Right, buy guns." Shi Niaoren was actually an infectious-disease specialist. Being a longtime internet lurker, he had learned of this operation. He had come back specifically because he knew of the transmigrators' weapons shortage, to discuss the matter.

"Tell us—what guns can you buy?"

"Type 56 semi-automatic, of course. Cheap and plentiful." Shi Niaoren explained that SKS-series semi-automatic rifles, though their prices had risen in America, were still relatively affordable weapons. Yugoslav ones were under $300; Northern (Chinese) ones around $400. Gun stores had plenty of stock. With money, you could buy as many as you wanted.

"Can you buy AKs? Machine guns?" Wang Luobin was getting excited.

"You can buy semi-auto AKs. Automatic weapons are out." Shi Niaoren said with some regret.

"Really? Aren't some states more relaxed? Plenty of Americans legally own automatic weapons."

"True—buying automatic weapons requires a Class III license and annual taxes. That's not a big problem; some states are lenient. The problem is these automatic weapons must have been on the market before 1987. That's due to the Firearms Owners' Protection Act passed in 1986. So now automatic weapons are not only extremely expensive, but generally old and in poor condition."

"I see..." Everyone was somewhat disappointed. To them, machine guns seemed the ultimate weapon of security.

"No matter—semi-automatic weapons are already very formidable." Xi Yazhou clearly didn't care much about full-auto versus semi-auto.

"We're mainly here to ask the Executive Committee what guns we should buy." Shi Niaoren looked a bit awkward. "Actually, I don't shoot; Xiao Rui is more familiar but isn't professional either. Here you have soldiers and serious enthusiasts—you probably know our needs better."

"Then let's go with the Type 56 semi," Wang Luobin said with some disappointment. "Most people here fired and field-stripped them during military training. It's a weapon we're relatively familiar with."

"No, I don't see it that way. The Type 56 semi is not a good choice."

The speaker was none other than Xi Yazhou—military veteran who theoretically had deep affection for the Type 56 semi.
