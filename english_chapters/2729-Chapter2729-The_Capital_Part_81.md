# Chapter 2729: The Capital (Part 81)

Wu Cheng thought briefly and said, "Hiding someone isn't a one- or two-day affair, so they definitely wouldn't hide in meadows or forests. Most likely, they'd be in a building somewhere."

There were many buildings in Nanyuan. The offices, guardhouses, and villages alone had over a thousand structures. Inside were also several hundred empty or abandoned official buildings and temples scattered about.

"If it were me, I'd hide the person in a temple."

Most villages were abandoned and now inhabited by the lawless castrated men. Hiding someone there was first, bad for secrecy, and second, likely to cause trouble.

The offices and guardhouses had too many people and eyes. The auxiliary workers and soldiers were mostly local riffraff who could easily leak information. So they wouldn't hide anyone there either.

"...The most likely places are the temples inside Nanyuan."

"Yuanling Palace?" Li Rufeng shook his head. "That's an imperially commissioned temple. It's not far from the Great Red Gate. Palace eunuchs come and go constantly. If a cat caught a mouse inside, the capital would know. How could they hide anyone there?"

"You don't know, Chief Escort. Besides Yuanling Palace, there are over ten temples and palaces inside! You only know the most famous one."

Li Rufeng was hearing this for the first time. He said in surprise, "No one but imperial relatives and sea households can enter. What do the monks and Daoists in those temples eat?"

"Originally, they ate imperial provisions," Wu Cheng said. "But since the Emperor doesn't visit the garden, life inside is quite hard. Many have fallen into ruin. Hiding someone there would be safest."

He listed the temples inside the garden one by one: Guandi Temple, Seven Sages Temple, Earth God Temple, Zhenwu Temple, Dragon Spirit Temple, Medicine King Temple, Dragon King Temple, Horse Spirit Temple, Dizang Nunnery, Bodhisattva Temple, and so on. Counting carefully, there were probably more than twenty. All had been built by the authorities over time.

"That's too many." Li Rufeng frowned. Setting aside whether the person was there at all, even if he was, these temples were scattered throughout Nanyuan. Searching them all would take considerable effort. Taking too long would inevitably alert whoever was guarding the hostage.

"...Most of these temples no longer have abbots or even monks or Daoists. If they wanted to hide someone, wouldn't it be inconvenient without a caretaker?"

Li Rufeng stared at Wu Cheng for a moment. "Old Wu, I don't think you've been an honest Daoist."

"The *Jianghu* tricks are just like that. Even without being in the trade, you learn from watching." Wu Cheng said. "Looking at it this way, there are only five temples where they could hide someone. The most likely place is 'Ningyou Temple.'"

Ningyou Temple was actually the Earth God Temple. It was imperially commissioned to "worship the earth god of the lake enclosure." In villages, earth god temples were usually just brick and stone shrines by the road; fancier ones were just a single-room building. But the earth god temple in Nanyuan was vastly different: a three-bay mountain gate, a three-bay main hall, a five-bay rear hall, and three-bay east and west side halls. Very impressive.

Because it was an earth god temple and the presiding Daoist had originally been a palace eunuch, they could still receive some money and rice from the palace each month. Its location wasn't far from the Eagle-Airing Platform—remote, with few visitors, yet convenient transportation.

"There are several other temples that might work, but Ningyou Temple is in the best position."

"Alright, we'll start the search with Ningyou Temple!"

"How many days has it been since we invited Senator Leng here?" Zhou Lezhi suddenly asked.

Liu Zhao was startled and said vaguely, "Nearly half a month, I suppose."

"It's been twenty days." Zhou Lezhi lightly tapped his palm with his fan, frowning. "Has the follow-up letter been sent?"

"It's been sent."

"Why is there still no word? Don't tell me they don't want this Senator Leng back?" A hint of anxiety showed in Zhou Lezhi's eyes.

"Mountains and passes separate us. Travel back and forth takes time and effort. This surnamed Wu doesn't dare make decisions himself. He has to consult with Lingao before making any decision. Moreover, this is a major matter. The Short-Hairs might even send someone to take charge. Round trip, it takes at least half a month. Getting a result within two months would already be fast." Liu Zhao reassured him.

Zhou Lezhi nodded reluctantly. Geographic distance was always a major problem, not to mention the Australians' inefficient system. Great policies couldn't be "dictated by one man"—they required discussion and voting by the group. For a topic like peace negotiations, it probably wouldn't yield results without ten days or half a month of debate.

Though his master had often spoken of the benefits of group decision-making, in Zhou Lezhi's view, the Short-Hairs had severe internal friction. If not for this bizarre group-deliberation system, if they had an "Emperor" or a "Prime Minister with power," they probably would have conquered Jiangnan long ago. In a way, this was also the Great Ming's blessing.

"Sir, do you think the Short-Hairs will agree to peace talks?" Liu Zhao was quite worried.

"About a sixty percent chance," Zhou Lezhi said. "Senators hold extremely high status—not comparable to powerful relatives or eunuchs. As long as we have Leng Ningyun in hand, they have to be wary. Even if they just play along, they have to put on a show."

"But..."

"Correct. For the court, this is just prolonging the inevitable. But as long as we can hold out for now, things may take a turn. The factional struggles among the Short-Hairs are fierce. Any matter can be used to attack each other. No matter how the Leng Ningyun affair ends, the Senate won't settle it without arguing for seven days and seven nights." Zhou Lezhi smiled disdainfully. "As far as I know, quite a few among the Short-Hairs don't want to fight the court and would rather go to the Southern or Eastern Seas to plunder people and treasure. Now that Leng Ningyun has been captured, this is their perfect excuse. It's not impossible they'll change direction."

"Is that really true?" Liu Zhao said in surprise.

Zhou Lezhi nodded. "It's absolutely true. Moreover, though the Short-Hairs have taken Liangguang, they've spent incalculable material and financial resources. Their military and civilian strength is at its limit. That's why the proposal to go south is gaining momentum."

"The court's situation today could be called 'besieged on all sides.' But as long as the court's orders can still reach everywhere, if there's a breathing room, and if capable people enter the cabinet, there may still be a chance."

"Are you referring to the Mr. Zhang who visited the lord a few days ago?"

"Naturally." Zhou Lezhi said. "Don't be fooled by Mr. Zhang having no official position. His power is no less than a cabinet minister's. Even our Chief Grand Secretary Wen treats him with courtesy."

"Chief Grand Secretary Wen's position is also for appeasement."

"Yes, but he doesn't dare say so openly," Zhou Lezhi said. "The one who wants appeasement most is probably the Emperor himself, but he absolutely cannot say so."

"So why not have Chief Grand Secretary Wen gather several ministers to submit a joint memorial?"

"Chief Grand Secretary Wen doesn't dare." Zhou Lezhi said. "This would be too humiliating for the court. Wen has made many enemies in court over the years. If he memorializes for peace, he'd probably drown in the spittle of court criticism! And unfortunately, the Emperor again..."

He didn't continue, but Liu Zhao understood his meaning. After a moment's thought, Liu Zhao said, "That may not be the case. Chief Grand Secretary Wen has been in the cabinet for seven years, and the Emperor has staunchly supported him despite court criticism. Everyone says the Emperor is 'plague-struck.'"

"Times have changed. Chief Grand Secretary Wen's position isn't so secure now," Zhou Lezhi said. "If he's not more careful, he probably won't make it to next year as Chief Grand Secretary."

Though Liu Zhao was used to his predictions, this casual remark still filled him with awe—because over the years, Mr. Zhou had never been wrong about major court affairs.

"If that's so, who else can propose appeasing the Short-Hairs?"

"It doesn't matter who proposes it. The key is having enough people in court support it to overpower the war faction. And someone in the palace must protect the ministers who support peace talks before the Emperor—tell me, is that difficult?"

"This... doesn't that mean we also have to curry favor with the powerful eunuchs in the palace?"

"Exactly so." Zhou Lezhi smiled.

"Sir, you're doing what others cannot," Liu Zhao flattering.

Zhou Lezhi smiled faintly. He knew that over the years, his position in Wang Yehao's group had been rising—simply because he could understand the "heavenly book" left by his master. Come to think of it, Lord Wang's current actions were somewhat related to the predictions in the "heavenly book."

The Great Ming's edifice was about to collapse. Once it fell, it wouldn't just be a change of dynasty—it would be the eternal doom of Chinese civilization.

But these things couldn't be explained to people like Liu Zhao. They were just tools. Explaining too clearly would only frighten them.

Liu Zhao said, "If the Short-Hairs proactively propose peace talks, the court's face would be saved. Even if the conditions are high, the Emperor might be able to accept."

"Exactly so."

As they chatted, a young man suddenly ran in and whispered a few words in Liu Zhao's ear. Liu Zhao was startled. "Really?"

Zhou Lezhi knew this youth was Xu Yong, a disciple Liu Sha had taken in—an orphan by origin. Usually, he stayed by his master's side; only when Liu Sha went elsewhere did he remain in the capital.

Xu Yong nodded, then bowed and withdrew.

"What is it?" Zhou Lezhi asked with concern. Liu Sha was now the operational commander. His every move affected success or failure.

"Liu Sha hasn't sent anyone with a letter," Liu Zhao said worriedly.

After Liu Sha went to Tongzhou, he would send someone to the capital every three days with a letter, exchanging intelligence with Liu Zhao and coordinating actions.

Today was the day for sending a letter. Tongzhou was only forty *li* from the capital. A fast walker could make the round trip in a day. The messenger set out on horseback in the morning and should reach the contact point in the capital before noon.

Now the sun had already passed noon, but the messenger hadn't arrived.

"Perhaps the messenger was delayed on the road..." Zhou Lezhi said.

"These past few days, the messenger has always arrived before noon," Liu Zhao said worriedly. "The road from the capital to Tongzhou is a major thoroughfare under the Son of Heaven's eyes. Traveling in broad daylight, nothing should happen."

Hearing this, Zhou Lezhi also became suspicious. Liu Sha was an extremely cautious person. He would never easily change agreed-upon arrangements.

"I know Brother Liu. He's most careful in handling matters," Zhou Lezhi said. "But there have been some flaws in recent operations. I'm worried..."

"I'll immediately send someone from the capital toward Tongzhou to investigate along the way."

"Will there be time?"

"By horse. They can definitely reach Tongzhou before nightfall!" Liu Zhao said. "I'll also send two more on foot to see if the first ones missed anything. They won't make it to Tongzhou tonight, so they'll stay halfway and continue tomorrow."
