# Chapter 1731: The Prominent Families of Guangzhou

This was a solid question, and Lü Yizhong had to treat it seriously. He thought for a moment and said, "As for the number one gentry family in Guangzhou, that would have to be Chen Jisheng's family."

Liu Xiang thought about the materials he had read, and it seemed there was no gentry with this name. He asked again, "Who is this person?"

"Speaking of this person, he is quite famous," Lü Yizhong said. "The Tanhua of the Jivei year of Wanli, former Right Vice Minister of Rites, and Lecturer before the Emperor..."

Liu Xiang said, "Could it be Chen Zizhuang?"

Lü Yizhong nodded: "It is indeed Mister Qiutao. His style name is Jisheng."

Liu Xiang vaguely remembered that the materials said Chen Zizhuang was imprisoned in the Imperial Prison by Chongzhen for "offending the Emperor." Had he been released now? He asked: "I remember he was imprisoned for offending the Ming Emperor."

"He returned last year," Lü Yizhong said. "Someone pleaded for him, and it is said that the Empress Dowager also interceded for him. In April last year, he 'redeemed his sentence and returned home.' However, he still has the status of a 'guilty official' and rarely shows his face in the city, living in his villa on Baiyun Mountain all the time."

Liu Xiang originally only knew that Chen Zizhuang was one of the "Three Loyalists of Lingnan," but he didn't expect him to be the number one gentry in Guangzhou City! Thinking about it again, no one in Guangzhou City could compare with him in terms of imperial examination honors. He was stripped of his post and reduced to a commoner for not compromising with Wei Zhongxian back then. The year before last, he was beaten at court and imprisoned for "speaking frankly." He was simply a model of the scholar-officials in the late Ming Dynasty. His status and appeal among the gentry could be imagined.

This person participated in the anti-Qing movement after the fall of Ming, fighting repeatedly despite repeated defeats. Finally, he was captured but refused to surrender and was executed by the Manchu Qing with cruel torture. Before dying, he even shouted, "Sawing a person requires a wooden board!" His character was extremely unyielding. He probably wouldn't be easy to deal with.

"Who is next?"

"That would have to be the Liang family. This family has a deep connection with the Senate..."

Liu Xiang knew he was talking about Liang Cunhou's family. The earliest gentry they connected with in Guangzhou City was Liang Cunhou. Later, when setting up the charity hall and recruiting refugees in Guangzhou, the Liang family contributed greatly, and the interactions were quite close. It wasn't until after the Chengmai Campaign that the relationship between the two sides gradually began to cool down. However, the Liang family had always been directors of the charity hall, and they still exchanged courtesies for celebrations and condolences. In short, there was no lack of etiquette. It was just that Liang Cunhou rarely came to Guo Yi's residence anymore.

"You mean Liang Cunhou's family, right?"

"Yes. His grandfather was the late Minister of Revenue Liang Renpu, and his father Liang Wendao served two terms as Prefect. The Liang family has a tradition of scholarship and etiquette, with imperial honors in every generation. The family has extensive land and property, and they are extremely particular about their clothing and utensils. They can be called a family of great wealth and nobility." Lü Yizhong said excitedly, " In terms of the ingenuity of gardens and pavilions, the beauty of concubines, the deliciousness of food and drink, and the exquisiteness of clothing and utensils, no second family in Guangzhou City can compare with them."

Then he mentioned several other famous gentry families in the city. Liu Xiang roughly summarized that the common characteristics of the leading figures among these gentry were that they had imperial honors for several generations, at least a Juren, and usually had passed the Jinshi examination and held positions in both the central and local governments. By intervening in local administration and organizing charities, they had great discourse power among the gentry and commoners. Their families had vast wealth and held the status of both big landlords and big merchants. Their clans were huge, with numerous children.

Liu Xiang thought to himself: This is a combination of gentry power, clan power, and discourse power.

The gentry the Senate encountered in Hainan mostly had insignificant imperial honors and low official positions. Even if there were a few gentry like Wang Honghui in Ding'an who were Jinshi and had held high positions, because of Hainan's poor economic situation and small population, their family power was often not large. Wang Honghui rose to the position of Minister of Rites in Nanjing, and his son served as a Prefect, but the Wang family only trained fifty or sixty village braves in Longmei Village. Even if they opposed the Senate, they couldn't make any waves.

Compared to them, the gentry in Guangzhou were like giants. It would not be an easy task to suppress and eliminate them.

Seeing his solemn expression, Lü Yizhong knew that the Australians hated gentry controlling the locality the most, so he hurriedly said: "The gentry and big households are people with families and properties. Even if they didn't know the importance of things in the past and were somewhat arrogant, as long as the Chief points out a clear path for them, shows them power, and cherishes them with virtue, they will naturally bend like grass in the wind."

Liu Xiang nodded and asked again, "So how should this be done?"

"First, we must put them at ease," Lü Yizhong said. "I wonder if the Chief has an order to summon the gentry of this city?"

"Not yet." Liu Xiang had indeed thought about this. But he felt that this matter was not urgent, so he hadn't handed it over to his subordinates.

"This matter should be done quickly. Although the Heavenly Army entered the city without committing any crimes and the city is peaceful, it is a change of dynasty after all. The gentry must be uneasy in their hearts. We must calm their hearts quickly. As long as the gentry are at ease and not chaotic, the common people will not be chaotic either. It also cuts off the thoughts of many people."

Liu Xiang was puzzled: "What do you mean by cutting off thoughts?"

"Every big clan has restless children, as well as those with foolish loyalty who just won't get it. Now that the Heavenly Army has suddenly descended, people's hearts are anxious, not knowing what actions the Senate will take. Under suspicion and fear, they fear being incited by others. If the Chief puts their hearts at ease, even if there are a few restless children, they will be suppressed by the patriarchs—how many people are willing to use their lives and property to be 'loyal and unyielding'? At that time, if there really are a few jumping clowns, the Chief won't even need to investigate; people within the clan will come to report them."

Liu Xiang smiled: "Good, good, Mister Lü is indeed a talent."

Lü Yizhong hurriedly said: "The Chief praises me too much."

"However, how can we put their hearts at ease?"

Lü Yizhong had a well-thought-out plan and said: "The gentry all have academic degrees from the Ming state and have held offices in the Ming state. Suddenly changing to a new dynasty, they are inevitably a little apprehensive. In my humble opinion, the Senate might as well proclaim to the world: The Great Song recognizes all academic degrees from the Ming state. This will not only calm the hearts of the gentry but also win the hearts of scholars all over the world."

Liu Xiang nodded slightly. This move was indeed powerful—the Manchus also used this trick when they entered the pass. It could be called a masterstroke in winning over the hearts of scholars. He hadn't thought of this in his original plan.

Once this policy came out, it would inevitably reduce the resistance to the Senate's "pacification by proclamation" in Guangdong.

However, the Senate despised and even was hostile towards traditional intellectuals. Would coming up with such a policy get him labeled as a "capitulationist"? He hesitated a bit.

Lü Yizhong was such a clever person. Seeing him silent, he gave a few dry laughs and said: "This is just a humble opinion of this lowly official, a humble opinion."

While Lü Yizhong and Liu Xiang were talking, Guo Xi'er came to the rear quarters. The two female family members of Prefect Dong, who had committed suicide, were still here.

Some luggage and items had already been piled up at the courtyard gate, and several National Army soldiers were guarding them. Prefect Dong's servants and family members were still detained here and had not been transferred to Guangxiao Temple—the Planning Institute Special Search Team still needed to find clues to the hidden silver from their mouths.

Guo Xi'er greeted the guarding soldiers and entered the courtyard. The main room was already empty. She stood at the door of the west wing room and shouted: "Concubine Jiang! Concubine Jiang!"

The door curtain was lifted, and a woman came out of the room. She was only in her early thirties, with plentiful flesh and cloud-like hair, an oval face without makeup, graceful and charming, her charm undiminished. It was just that she had suffered a disaster, her hair was disheveled, and her face was dark and yellow. She came out, shrinking back, lowered her head, stood, and said: "Miss Guo, did you call me? Please come inside to talk."

Guo Xi'er walked in. The east wing also had three rooms, one bright and two dark. The middle one was for living, and the two sides were used as bedrooms. Guo Xi'er came from a poor family and knew very little about the style of big families. But the east wing faced west. It was exposed to the sun in summer and the northwest wind in winter. It was the coldest in winter and hottest in summer. Concubine Jiang and her daughter living here showed their status in the Dong family.

The furnishings in the room were also simple. The arrangement was neat and elegant, showing that a lot of care had been taken.

Concubine Jiang asked her to sit down. Guo Xi'er said, "No need. I'm just here to pass on a message: The Chief said he won't see you. He wants you to be at ease." She repeated what Liu Xiang had said, and comforted her with a few sentences:

"Although your master is gone, you and your daughter still have to live. Don't take your own lives lightly—the Senate always gives everyone a way out. If you mother and daughter have difficulties, I will naturally report them for you."

The woman was somewhat disappointed and responded in a low voice. Suddenly, the curtain was flung open, and a young girl walked out from inside. She was only fifteen or sixteen years old, wearing a lotus-colored vest with sky-cyan borders and a narrow-sleeved long jacket. She generously curtsied to Guo Xi'er and said: "Blessings to you, Miss! This servant knows that the Australian Master is busy and has no time to pay attention. It's just that this servant has important military intelligence to report. If the Australian Master knows, there will be great benefits."

Guo Xi'er was a bit troubled hearing this. She didn't know what these "great benefits" were, but she understood the weight of "important military intelligence." She didn't know what "important military intelligence" this girl had. If there was nothing important at all, wouldn't the Chief blame her?

Originally, she shouldn't have taken on this matter. It was just that seeing the mother and daughter were pitiful, and Concubine Jiang spoke with an accent from her hometown, her heart softened and she agreed.

She hesitated and said: "Miss Dong, can you tell me a little about this important military intelligence? The Chief is very busy. If it's nothing important..."

Miss Dong said: "Go tell your master: I want to see him not for revenge, nor to ask for favors. I know the whereabouts of many high-ranking officials in this Guangzhou Prefecture. As long as he is willing to see me, he will definitely get a great credit before the Emperor of the Great Song."

This surprised Guo Xi'er a bit. First, this girl's father had just committed suicide for the Great Ming. Not only had her status as an official's daughter vanished, but her future was also uncertain: officials dying in office, their families stranded in foreign lands, suffering from poverty and illness, and even falling into the brothel pit, were common occurrences in the past.

The Jiang mother and daughter could now be said to have both national hatred and family rancor concentrated in their bodies. Such a girl suddenly proposed to help the Australians capture the local "high officials" hiding among the people. Guo Xi'er couldn't wrap her head around it for a moment, not knowing how to answer.

However, the report just sent did mention that the whereabouts of several provincial officials of the Great Ming in Guangzhou City were unknown. It was not known where they were hiding, and they were being searched for.
