# Chapter 94: Employment System (Part 1)

Because Ye Yuming had raised rabbits and poultry before, Wu Nanhai assigned him to manage small animals. With rabbit numbers still low, no special housing—just a three-level rabbit hutch in the yard. But when tending rabbits, he found them listless, not eating much. Were they sick? In the agricultural library, he found this passage: *"Domestic rabbits have weak disease resistance. In damp, unclean environments, they easily contract diseases causing great losses—especially young rabbits. Thus follow dry, clean management principles for housing; implement sanitation and epidemic prevention. Also, rabbits tolerate cold but not heat. When temperatures exceed 30°C, adults reduce or stop eating; does easily miscarry, reduce milk, or refuse nursing—also inducing disease outbreaks. During hot periods, watch heat prevention and cooling."*

*Damp? Hot? Rabbits? Why did we bring rabbits to Hainan?!* And there was even an Angora pair! No choice—find a shaded, ventilated spot. This hutch was supposedly under fruit trees, but those "trees" were still seedlings. He moved the cages into an empty room, periodically sprinkling water around to cool. Rabbit feed: Wu Nanhai took no responsibility—fortunately, he had experience cutting fodder. After vegetable harvest, cafeteria scraps could feed rabbits too. When Wu Nanhai's sweet potatoes matured, he could collect large quantities of sweet-potato vines for rabbit feed—though these creatures looked listless now, once they recovered, their reproduction rate was astonishing.

The first few days were basic land-clearing. Engineering bulldozers removed stones, roots, and weeds, trucking in large quantities of excavation waste to deepen the topsoil. Such land was still too raw—suitable only for sweet potatoes. For hybrid rice, to be safe, wait until next spring—he needed to see how low winter temperatures dropped. Wu Nanhai also planned winter wheat and barley—barley liked cool climates, tolerated some cold, and matured quickly, fitting between main crop plantings.

Farmwork was extremely hard—leveling land, digging channels, plowing, applying base fertilizer. Though machinery helped, manual labor was still substantial. Applications to the Agriculture Group were surprisingly numerous—many envisioned idyllic pastoral life. Shortly after farming began, some complained of exhaustion or claimed skill mismatch, transferring to other groups. Wu Nanhai himself found it overwhelming—better to be an agricultural advisor giving guidance while farmers did actual work. The farmers Wu De sent really worked hard.

After over a month of adjustment, Wu De's labor team had become very efficient. He used five mutually antagonistic people as captains, deliberately encouraging competition. Such personal grudges between leaders worked better than any intimidation—each captain strenuously drove their subordinates, fearing falling behind rivals.

Wu De opportunely introduced material incentives: each day's first team to complete labor quotas received extra food. He also implemented "last-place elimination"—every seven days, the lowest-completing team lost four members to the top four teams. If a captain lost all members, he became ordinary labor, losing all benefits.

Wu De's measure tested captains' management skills. It intensified competition; captains relying solely on violence—beatings, starvation—could only achieve short-term results. Oppressed workers also saw countermeasures—just slack off for four consecutive weeks, and the lofty captain would fall. Both sides had to balance for effective cooperation.

Clearly, Fu Youdi adapted extremely poorly. The earliest prisoner captain, he'd immediately lorded over others—not working himself, only grabbing benefits. When four former subordinates became captains, he felt extremely unbalanced. To maintain "senior captain" face before Wu De, he increasingly oppressed subordinates, even cultivating two or three enforcers by skimming rations—establishing a tyrannical mini-kingdom. Hardly a day passed without beatings in his camp. Result: growing hatred within his team—yet he remained oblivious.

Wang Tian was more honest. Though he also grabbed extra benefits, he didn't oppress subordinates; he worked hard himself. People liked him—but some then slacked off. At first, Wang Tian meekly avoided managing; only when quotas slipped did he panic and beat people. When quotas rose, he repeated the cycle.

The other two were roughly between Fu Youdi and Wang Tian. By comparison, Lin Xing's performance impressed Wu De. He divided subordinates into small groups, assigning division of labor based on daily work content. He led by example—eating, living, and laboring together. Others' shares he never touched; even bonus food he shared with subordinates. But slackers received no mercy—truly "clear rewards and punishments." The whole team respected him—even former small landlords and rich peasants admired him. One landlord privately invited him to become his estate's labor foreman.

*Among the common people, there are indeed heroes.* Wu De thought. Unlike moderns who accessed all kinds of information everywhere—how had an illiterate poor tenant like Lin Xing learned this? Were some people born with leadership charisma?

Wu De also gradually improved laborers' meals. Now they had one dry and one thin meal daily—admittedly, the dry rice was mixed with local grains—but for workers, quite good. Some captains still skimmed food; he deliberately pretended not to know. Thus ordinary workers grew more resentful toward captains, feeling pirates were more conscientious.

After over two continuous weeks, Fu Youdi's team was on the brink of collapse. After finishing last two weeks running—losing eight people—furious Fu Youdi announced one day's food suspension as punishment. Workers who'd long suffered under him finally snapped—swarming him with fists and kicks. Even his enforcers weren't spared—beaten black and blue.

Other teams were stunned by this upheaval. Wu De had contingency plans—he'd instructed camp guards in such situations: no need to enter and suppress, just control the perimeter and prevent escapes. He'd planned to let them settle naturally before sorting things out—but unexpectedly, Lin Xing spontaneously led people in to quell the disturbance.

Fu Youdi's subordinates, seeing Wu De arrive, knelt before him, competing to denounce various crimes: some he knew about; others greatly surprised him—fully teaching him that no one could play god. Fu Youdi had actually been secretly hoarding steel tools issued for work. Workers had long noticed "Chiefs'" tools were far superior to crude iron implements they'd used before—light, durable, staying sharp without frequent sharpening. Fu Youdi calculated—Lingao lacked iron products; iron tools were imported from the mainland; these excellent tools should fetch good prices. Though tools were logged during issue, daily work made it impractical to check out and return daily—they were stored in a shed. Every few days, he secretly hid one. Under mass exposure, the bruised Fu Youdi led Wu De to his hiding spot—grass by the river—surrendering over a dozen shovels, spades, steel bars.

Seeing this pile, transmigrators present were speechless. *Were we really smarter than "natives"?* Here and now, seeing a prisoner stealthily steal items right under their noses—no one dared claim so.

Who'd have thought Fu Youdi—meek and inarticulate two months ago—would descend to this. Watching workers' angry denunciations, Wu De was even more convinced: 17th-century human nature was no different from the 21st century.

But Fu Youdi's case exposed many unforeseen problems: no workers had reported Fu Youdi's issues—silently seething until finally exploding together—a Chinese-style resolution. Apparently, his prisoner-management policy also had shortcomings.

*I focused too much on internal contradictions.* Wu De rubbed his forehead, troubled. *Only thinking about keeping them disunited, unable to resist together. Didn't expect the prison-boss I created would also tightly control subordinates. Even my planted "would-be-joiners" never informed on him due to fear. If Fu Youdi had been more than a petty miser—if he'd hidden tools for a sudden revolt—there might have been casualties.* Mutual restraint among people had completely failed to materialize.

Fundamentally, his starting point had been off, Wu De reflected. He was still using old experience. Though successful at personnel management and brainwashing, these methods only aimed at keeping people orderly, docile, obedient workers. Not enough for cultivating initiative. What they needed were local allies—the foundation on which the transmigrators' edifice would be built. Constant surveillance, control, and exploitation would never win these people's loyalty.
