# Chapter 40 - Prophet (Second Update Today)

Chapter 40 Prophet (Second Update Today)

At that moment, he exchanged a few pleasantries and took his leave. Returning to the stronghold, Shopkeeper Sun of Qiwei Escort Agency had been waiting for a long time. Before he could arch his hands to thank, Shopkeeper Sun had already arched his hands to congratulate. Xiao Zishan spent one hundred taels of silver as a thank-you gift.

"Several shopkeepers are truly talents in both civil and martial arts!" Shopkeeper Sun took the silver, smiling like a flower, "Good Kung Fu, good sharp firearms! My apprentices and martial nephews came back saying they had seen rescuing hostages, but never seen such a clean rescue."

"If not for the help of the masters of Qiwei, we strangers would probably still be blind."

"Where where, Qiwei just did a meager effort." Shopkeeper Sun casually handed the silver to the small apprentice behind him, "I have a word, please Shopkeeper Xiao consider."

"Please speak."

"Although rescuing the hostage was smooth this time, the bandits have already been here and know the way. Must guard against their revenge. As the saying goes: there is a thousand days of being a thief, but no thousand days of guarding against a thief. Masters have many goods and wealth here, must act carefully."

Xiao Zishan couldn't quite understand his meaning. Having just been tricked by Fox Gao, looking at Shopkeeper Sun's smile now also seemed like a fox. So he remained vigilantly silent.

Seeing he didn't pick up the conversation, Shopkeeper Sun had to speak straight to the point. The meaning was that their Qiwei Escort Agency was willing to watch the night for this house, that is, to act as night security guards. Besides sitting in the shop, this was the main business of the escort agency in the city.

Watching the night was not being nursing home guards. The escort agency didn't care about daytime affairs. Only when the watch started every day, and all rooms and courtyards in the mansion were locked and lights were lit, would the escorts enter the courtyard to patrol.

"If shopkeepers feel it's not convenient enough. You can buy a few young servants, and we will train a few good hands for shopkeepers as personal guards."

So it was promoting security services. Xiao Zishan thought night security was better not to have. There were too many secrets in this house, and the escorts were all shrewd and capable people. Over time, it was inevitable that they would spy out clues. As for training a few guards, it was useful, but he couldn't make the decision on these matters.

However, the Executive Committee decided to fully utilize the line of Qiwei Escort Agency. At present, they only had Gao Ju as one agent. Social contact was too narrow. In comparison, the escort agency was an industry that had interactions with all levels of society. From dignitaries to bandits and hooligans, they were familiar with and could deal with them. It would be very convenient for Transmigrators to carry out work in the future.

Compared with other industries and social classes, practitioners of the escort agency were the people with the most traditional martial virtues, valuing trust and righteousness. Once they could be used by us, they would be reliable helpers.

To make people used by me, one must distribute favors. But the masters of the escort agency were different from ordinary people. Although for the sake of making a living, they "nodded spring" and "made friends" with bandits - that was just to eat this bowl of rice. In fact, they were very cautious in making friends. Trying to win favor by being generous with money wouldn't work. If not done well, one might get the reputation of a "sucker" and be looked down upon by them.

Fortunately, China has always been a society of human feelings and patriarchal clan system. The relationship between relatives, clans, and master-apprentices is the closest. It is easier to start here.

Xiao Zishan said according to the routine discussed by the Executive Committee: "This time Sun Chang contributed a lot. Several of us discussed and decided to remove his slave status."

"This is a great grace." Shopkeeper Sun stood up and bowed deeply - although removing slave status might not be a good thing for a servant, especially if the master family was unwilling to take him in after having nowhere to go, it would simply be a dead end - but anyway, Sun Chang was both his clan nephew and martial nephew. Humbling himself as a slave, he as an uncle also lost face.

"This grace was also earned by himself," he deliberately glanced at Gao Xian who was serving tea at the side, "When the master is in trouble, not afraid of things, willing to stand out and exert effort, naturally cannot be treated unfairly."

He continued: "Sun Chang's slave status is removed, but he is loyal and usable. If he is willing, we will still keep him to handle affairs."

"This child Sun Chang, you flatter him too much." Shopkeeper Sun showed excitement on his face. Even if the escort agency business was good, adding him as an escort would just be traveling north and south to protect goods for a lifetime. If he could stay under the Australian shopkeepers to handle affairs, the future prospects would be much better than being an escort.

"In the future when he runs errands, he will still need you, the elder, to take care of him more."

"This is natural," Shopkeeper Sun patted his chest hurriedly, "Things instructed by shopkeepers are things of Qiwei. Will definitely do our best."

Good, interesting. Indeed, things of one family are taken more care of.

He signaled Gao Xian to retreat. Then he continued: "There is also Gao Di. You have also seen him, a young servant here. Instructed him to inquire about various news on the market. He is extremely clever and smart. But I worry he is too young, and frequenting the marketplace for a long time easily makes him learn bad things. Moreover, without Kung Fu on him, he is easily disadvantaged. So please Qiwei discipline him well. Although the escort agency has wide interactions with both black and white ways, it is rare to hold righteousness without evil. Handing him to your hands, we are at ease."

"Shopkeeper overpraised." Shopkeeper Sun was radiant. The few Australian shopkeepers really looked up to us men.

Xiao Zishan saw the timing was about right, so he didn't say more. Both sides exchanged a few perfunctory words and dispersed.

Xiao Zishan crossed back that night to report the relevant situation to the Executive Committee. Whether to allow Gao Ju to credit caused a debate. Both those who agreed and those who opposed had extremely sufficient reasons. For a time, neither side could convince the other.

Yu Eshu's speech provided a line of thought.

"What month is it there now?"

"April thirtieth."

"It's April 30th of the seventh year of Tianqi." Yu Eshu nodded, "In another eighteen days, Emperor Xizong will go to Xiyuan for amusement after sacrificing at Fangze Tan, and as a result, the wind will blow over the boat and he will fall into the water. Although saved by Tan Jing, his body will go from bad to worse from then on."

"He won't die until August. Are you asking Gao Ju to drag the building of the living shrine until August? I'm afraid even if you play tricks, it's impossible to make him have such guts to wait for the emperor to die." Those with quick reactions already understood his line of thought.

"Hehe, you underestimate the bureaucrats' sensitivity to political wind direction too much." Yu Eshu said, "Why did Wei Zhongxian become the Nine Thousand Nine Hundred Years? Isn't it relying on the emperor's favor and trust? His honor and disgrace all depend on the life and death of Emperor Xizong. Tianqi himself was not in good health, and never recovered after falling into the water this time. Once the emperor dies, Prince Xin will inevitably ascend the throne. Even if Wei Zhongxian doesn't fall, he can't manipulate power like in the Tianqi reign. Since this is the case, bureaucrats won't be eager to express their stance in such an unclear situation.

"Since this Eunuch Yang was not originally a member of Wei Zhongxian's party, but just wanted to take this opportunity to curry favor, if the situation suddenly becomes unclear, I'm afraid he will be the first to postpone this matter. Not taking the lead to build the living shrine means maintaining the status quo; if built, in case the emperor dies and the new master ascends the throne, nine out of ten things will be turned over. Isn't he adding trouble to himself?"

"Will Wei Zhongxian just watch helplessly as Prince Xin ascends the throne? We know it's Chongzhen after Tianqi, but those bureaucrats don't know."

"Tianqi had no heirs, so of course he could only pass it to his brother." Someone explained.

"Actually, Tianqi had three sons in total, but none reached adulthood. According to historical records and modern historians' research, the princes were likely harmed by Wei and Ke. By the seventh year of Tianqi, his youngest son had been dead for two years. Once the emperor falls ill and cannot get up, the only person who can inherit the throne is his brother Prince Xin, Youjian.

"Although Tianqi was muddled, he valued affection for his Empress Zhang and fifth brother Youjian. Wei Zhongxian once attempted to manufacture a big case to frame the Empress's father Zhang Guoji for 'plotting to establish Prince Xin', thereby striking at dissidents. Wang Tiqian, the eunuch of the Directorate of Ceremonial, knew the emperor's temper and strongly advised: 'The Lord is muddled in everything, only not thin in brotherhood and couplehood. If there is any mishap, we will lose our lives.' Hearing this, Wei Zhongxian turned pale with fright and hurriedly cancelled the plan. It can be seen that Emperor Xizong's trust in the Empress and Prince Xin was known to everyone. Unless Tianqi has an heir again, otherwise the emperor's death and Prince Xin's ascension are a certainty. Bureaucrats are very clear about this."

"Once the emperor falls ill, Wei Zhongxian, this blue-chip stock in the Great Ming stock market, will be in imminent danger, and Prince Xin, this potential stock, will naturally be favored by everyone. At this time, will anyone go to buy heavily into a stock that might break the issue price or even be suspended tomorrow?"

"Then I notify Gao Ju to drag past May 18th?"

"News is not that fast, right? News from Beijing to Guangzhou takes at least ten days. Better notify him to drag until the end of May to see the outcome."

"Hehe, although I don't approve of playing tricks, I think on this matter, we can show a little prediction ability - explicitly stating that there will be a change in the court situation on May 18th. Predicting the future has a strong temptation for anyone, let alone predicting such a major court change. Once verified, this lethality is very great. Although it won't make others bow down and become younger brothers immediately, it can fully increase the atmosphere that we are complying with the mandate of heaven." Yu Eshu said with a smile.

This solution was not only peculiar but also greatly satisfied the Transmigrators' hobby of acting as "prophets". For a time, some people suggested that Yu Eshu act as a "prophet" to interview Gao Ju and Little Eunuch Yang. Others simply suggested Yu Eshu enter the capital to find Cao Huachun. Maybe later there would be the merit of supporting Chongzhen, and Transmigrators could use modern technology and concepts to transform the emperor directly, bringing China into a democratic, harmonious and developed Great Ming prosperity...

Yu Eshu instantly lost his appetite: Do these people think the Eastern Depot and the Brocade Guard are deaf ears? Such "demon words" arrogantly discussing the life and death of emperors would definitely be arrested into the Imperial Prison to taste the tortures of eunuchs immediately. Even if Cao Huachun is willing to listen to these crazy words, Prince Xin is keeping a low profile at this moment, rarely seeing even close attendants, let alone seeing any "prophet"! If this resolution is really passed, whoever wants to be a prophet can go, he won't join in the fun.

Fortunately, there were not many hot-headed people, and this whimsical resolution was not passed. Yu Eshu then came up with some detailed ideas: such as not speaking too clearly to avoid scaring Gao Ju. Fear can cause many unexpected things. Just saying there must be a great change on May 18th is enough. Moreover, cannot say it is known by oneself, but say someone observed the celestial phenomena at night and so on. Anyway, it has to be misty and vague.

"Remember one thing, do not say Wei Zhongxian will fall or when the emperor will die. Words concerning such major matters, Gao Ju will definitely go tell Little Eunuch Yang. With the nature of these people, not for merit but for avoiding disaster, they will report and arrest you immediately!" Yu Eshu emphasized to them finally.
