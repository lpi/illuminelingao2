# Chapter 1693 - Summing Up

Liu Yuanhu came in with his head lowered, first called out "Chief," then stood properly without making a sound.

Yun Suji said: "What, gone mute? I saw you were quite majestic in the village."

Liu Yuanhu's face flushed with shame, saying: "Chief, I..."

"You don't need to say. You were indeed a bit too majestic in the village. However, to do the job well, it's true you can't go on without some majesty." Yun Suji lit a cigarette for himself, "But, this majesty of yours was mostly shown for work, so I don't blame you. Everyone is for the great cause of the Senate..."

Hearing these words, Liu Yuanhu's eyes instantly turned red. He lifted his head and said: "Chief, I date not say I don't have a single selfish thought, but I am truly loyal to the Senate with a red heart and guts. Even if you want me to rip it out for the Chief to see, I will!"

Yun Suji waved his hand and said: "Don't get excited. Why is a perfectly good man getting red-eyed? Being a cadre, firstly, don't be afraid of people talking. If you get scared like this in your heart after listening to a few rumors, how can you do big things?"

"Yes! I will remember!"

"How do you say we deal with this matter of Old Lady Cao?"

"Give the pension to her!"

Yun Suji shook his head: "Returning the pension to her, that is what should be done. I'm talking about the matter of her hanging herself at the village office."

Liu Yuanhu scratched his scalp and said: "This... Since she is fine, let's consider this matter passed..."

Yun Suji said: "You are the Militia Captain, so naturally you are also the Village Public Order Commissioner, right?"

"Yes."

"How did you study this 'Public Order Commissioner Handbook'?" Yun Suji shook his head, "Is there one here? Get me a copy."

Liu Yuanhu hurriedly dug it out from the bookshelf. Yun Suji took it and looked; except for a red "Borang Village Office" stamp on the cover, it was the same as new. This practice of producing and issuing handbooks was "fool-proof" guidance made to adapt to the low level of grassroots civil servants—it seemed the effect was not great.

He opened the book, turned to one of the pages, pointed at the text and said: "You can read, right?"

"Attended literacy class, can read, can't write very well..."

"What does this article say?"

"Anyone who engages in behavior that hinders the work and environment of the office within government agencies and public institutions shall be punished as the crime of 'disturbing government and public institutions', and corresponding penalties shall be given according to the seriousness of the circumstances..."

"Understand it?"

Liu Yuanhu read it a few times, his eyes lit up, and he nodded vigorously: "Yes! Chief. I understand."

"Where is the Resident Police responsible for your village?"

"Our village has few residents, so we share a resident police station with the nearby Boli Village." Liu Yuanhu said, "But it's not far."

"Since a suicide case has occurred, customarily it should be reported and handled. Ask him to come over first thing tomorrow morning to take a statement."

"Yes, Chief." Liu Yuanhu was about to go out when Yun Suji stopped him again, "I heard everyone say there is a labor reform team here. Who runs it?"

"It's run by the county." Liu Yuanhu said, "People caught from various villages are sent in to work for a few days. Each township has a squadron."

Yun Suji nodded: "Good, I know."

Yun Suji talked with the village cadres one by one, gaining a deeper understanding of the village's situation. Because they had spoken openly, the three village cadres also spoke more clearly than yesterday.

He also gained a rough understanding of the village's finances. Han Daoguo said that in order to "strive for model status" and "create advanced status" in recent years, they engaged in a lot of road and water conservancy construction. Because the village had no entity economy and couldn't speak of income, they could only "raise funds" from villagers. But fundraising didn't go smoothly, and they had to use coercive means to collect it completely. Even so, the village still incurred a deficit.

"...We still owe the Heaven and Earth Society project payments. Money has already been collected once this year; if we collect again, everyone will have complaints. We just rely on this bit of money to maneuver around." Han Daoguo argued regarding the detention of the pension money.

Yun Suji knew there was water in these words, but he wasn't an auditor and couldn't clear up the threads within a short time. So he just listened to him speak, silently memorizing the key points, preparing to write them in his notes later for the Cheka's annual audit as a reference.

Han Daoguo complained again, saying the village office had no office expenses. The county gave the village office of this village thirty mu of "office land." This thirty mu of land was tax-free and cultivated by the village cadres themselves; the agricultural products were the village office's expenses and subsidies for the village cadres' "public service."

"The income from this thirty mu of land, let alone give us subsidies, isn't even enough for the village's expenses." Han Daoguo chattered on. Although work in the village could conscript corvée labor, conscripting labor meant providing meals, and every meal had to be solid food. There were many projects in the village, and just feeding the corvée labor was a significant expense. "When work is completed, we also have to act a celebratory meal, with white flour and pork. Where does this money come from? It's all scratched out from the soil. Not afraid of Chief laughing at us, the deficit incurred last year still hasn't been paid off to this day..."

Yun Suji smiled and said: "So you are all serving the public on empty stomachs then."

Han Daoguo's face turned red, and he stammered: "It hasn't reached that point..."

He got up and walked a few steps, saying: "Let alone this office land, just speaking of the land belonging to your own families, who cultivates it themselves? Isn't it all planted for free by conscripting the village's labor? Do you think I don't know? Otherwise, how could you play chess in the village office in broad daylight!"

Han Daoguo's face turned from red to white, unable to say a single word.

"Those little matters of yours, I can figure them out with my eyes closed. Save the sloppy work." Yun Suji said, "I don't care about these things right now. You first explain the true situation of the village's finances properly!"

Only then did Han Daoguo become more honest. He said it was true that the village accounts had a deficit, and the figure wasn't small. The reason was the same as mentioned above: incurred by engaging in capital construction. However, regarding the village fundraising, three rounds had actually been held this year, and the villagers had very strong opinions. Fan Twelve was afraid of angering the villagers so much that someone would go to the county to sue, so he didn't dare to launch a fourth round.

"How did you incur such a large deficit? Doesn't the county give subsidies for these constructions?" Yun Suji asked in surprise.

"Chief, subsidies are indeed given, but there is also a self-raised portion. We are a model village; visitors and those coming to learn from us stream in endlessly throughout the year. The county, the township, the Heaven and Earth Society... and various inspections. Just entertaining the visitors with meals is a large expense..." Han Daoguo complained.

"For those coming to the village on business, isn't it all 'eating arranged meals' where they pay cash directly to the farmer households? Doesn't your county issue meal subsidies for public business trips?"

"Chief, that's a saint like you! Can the cadres coming from the county and township be dismissed with a bowl of sweet potato porridge and a few pancakes? At the very least, a pancake must be baked, a bowl of noodles cooked, and if nothing else, white rice with some pickles and salted vegetables." Han Daoguo said, "Assigning it to villagers to make, the villagers find it troublesome, and the comrades on business trips don't eat well either. So the village designated a family to specialize in making..."

"So the comrades coming to the countryside paid the money for sweet potato porridge and pancakes but ate pancakes rolled with eggs?"

Han Daoguo hurriedly said: "Chief sees clearly! Using this village office of ours, that's a yamen so small it can't be smaller. If we don't entertain well, many things cannot be strived for, and the model plaque may not be kept. This is also a helpless matter..."

"Alright, no need to say more!" Yun Suji became angrier the more he listened. He hadn't expected that in less than two or three years, the grassroots level would have this virtue!

Magistrate Liu, and you call this a model county! Yun Suji understood as soon as he heard it; this phenomenon was definitely not isolated. Maybe someone didn't even pay the money for sweet potato porridge and was eating pancakes rolled with eggs.

After finishing the questioning, Yun Suji rested in the village office. There was a kerosene lamp in the village office, and he wrote down his observations under the lamp. He went to the countryside a lot, but he had never completely immersed himself like today, eating, living, and working together with the farmers, never feeling the pulse of rural life so truly. This day today was truly very beneficial.

This was still a model village. If he went to an ordinary village or a backward village, who knows what the situation would be. Yun Suji thought there were many problems in grassroots work, and there were also big problems with farmers' sentiments. A sense of comfort in muddling through days could be felt very clearly among the majority of villagers, while a few grain households couldn't develop due to various restrictions, and their enthusiasm was hit.

From today's observations, farmers without appropriate management and education had the style of very short-sighted opportunists: opportunistic, undisciplined, no concept of time (work time calculated by day, only precise to morning and afternoon), no organizational discipline. Such farmers were useless to the Senate's cause.

Too much corvée labor was considered a problem, but what was obvious was that corvée labor didn't affect normal production. What really affected production were those grain households with large sowing areas and engaged in many sideline businesses. How to balance the relationship between the two was a question that needed discussion.

Yun Suji strongly disapproved of the proposal by some people to replace the current "labor conscription" with a "labor redemption" system. The Ming Dynasty before their eyes was a typical negative example. The Single Whip Law had a good starting point and temporarily played a certain effect. In the end, it became a strand of rope in the noose that tangled the late Ming farmers to death. It perfectly interpreted "Huang Zongxi's Law."

"Corvée labor conscription must be scientific, quantitative, and standardized." He wrote this line in his notebook, "Must come up with a scientific standard to see where the limit of burden lies. Provide as much labor as possible without affecting production..."

He thought of the women making shoes and needlework in groups of three or five by the village entrance roadside, the men who beat their wives every now and then, the old people and children idling at home... All these fully explained that their free time was still too much. The most important resource, humans, must be fully utilized to exert their effect.

He then thought that the village's sideline businesses were still too few. Except for raising draft cattle and a small number of chickens and ducks, almost no one was seen raising pigs. Many people reported that the homestead area was too small, and the breeding area reserved at the beginning of the design was insufficient. If a pigsty was built next to the main house according to traditional methods, the county's health police would disagree, saying this "broke the law."

In addition, there was almost completely no commerce in the village. Logically speaking, for a village of nearly five hundred people, having a small oil and salt shop was always proper...
