# Chapter 996 Changhua Fort

This place was Changhua Fort. Since the first circumnavigation of the island, Changhua, as the first independent overseas fortress, had been expanded several times. From an originally crude fortified blockhouse, it had expanded into a small coastal bastion. Under the fluttering Morning Star flag, a 24-pounder naval cannon on the bastion controlled Sanjia Harbor—Changhua's maritime gateway.

Less than one kilometer outside the bastion, on the coastal wasteland near the Changhua River, a large area of wasteland was enclosed with wooden palisades and thorny fast-growing plants, with rows of livestock pens built. This was the Changhua Pasture—currently the main source of draft animals and meat livestock used by Lingao.

The Agricultural Committee raised large numbers of the famous Changhua sheep here on the seaside pasture. Cattle were supplied by the local Li people. Wu Nanhai and Yang Baogui came to Changhua Pasture multiple times to inspect and guide work, continuously expanding the scale of animal husbandry. Yang Baogui in particular used Changhua sheep as the mother lineage locally, breeding improved sheep using frozen sperm. The Agricultural Committee also sowed large quantities of quality pasture grass suited to the local soil and climate here.

Through the Agricultural Committee's efforts, large numbers of live sheep and cattle were now transported from Changhua to Lingao every month.

Outside the Changhua Pasture, a small periodic market formed. The Li people came here on the first and fifteenth of each month to trade various local products: exchanging cattle, cotton cloth, venison and deer hides, kapok, and honey locust beans for salt, hardware, white sugar, and various daily sundries. At other times, Changhua Fort also dispatched mobile trading caravans deep into the Changhua interior to conduct trade.

Large quantities of sundry goods transported from Lingao stimulated the Li people's consumer desires—compared to the past when there was only a trading basket, selling nothing but some salt and hardware, with prices that were highway robbery, the Australians provided diverse, high-quality products at much cheaper prices.

Although the Li people didn't accumulate gold and silver, the mountains had abundant local products. As long as one put in the effort, local products the Australians were willing to exchange for were everywhere. If the Planning Bureau hadn't been unwilling to let the large and small deer species of Changhua go extinct all at once, limiting the monthly purchase quantity, the Li people would probably have killed off all the local deer already.

Such trade naturally destroyed some local people's livelihoods, but building and operating Changhua Fort required large amounts of manpower. These unemployed people were quickly hired by Changhua Fort. Although some harbored resentment, no one had the guts to provoke the "Hair Bandits" who were armed with guns and even had cannons.

Besides barter trade with the Li people, Li Haiping also, following industrial department instructions, hired large numbers of local laborers to mine quartz sand to supply Lingao's glass industry.

As Changhua Fort hired more and more people, Commander Li Haiping selected some able-bodied men from the hired workers to form a fifty-person "militia," equipped with machetes and standard spears, to protect the pasture's safety.

As for the local government, they turned a blind eye to the Hair Bandits' every move—of course, even if they wanted to do something, they'd be powerless. In Changhua, Great Ming's presence was quite weak.

This peaceful situation continued until the Summer Awakening Campaign: a Marine company and three 12-pounder mountain howitzers landed at Sanjia Harbor; subsequently, led by the "guides" organized by Changhua Fort—the Changhua Fort militia—they quickly advanced to the walls of Changhua County seat. The county clerk acting as county administrator unhesitatingly opened the gates and surrendered. As for the guard station outside the city, although they briefly concentrated able-bodied men among the military households for battle preparation, once the Marines wheeled out the cannons and fired just one shot, the garrison soldiers scattered and fled. Li Haiping commanded the Marines in a single charge to take the guard station; the rest all surrendered without resistance. Casualties on both sides were zero.

Changhua's Han Chinese population was extremely small. Apart from a few officer-landlords in the guard station, there were no forces worth calling gentry. Because villages were few and Li areas many, ordinary bandits had no room for activity. During the northern Qiong pacification war, this place had been very peaceful, with no armed conflicts. It was a typical peaceful takeover.

Although they occupied the county seat, the Senate's local governing apparatus never entered Changhua County seat—the former Changhua county clerk "caring for the Changhua County seal" still remained in the dilapidated county yamen. It wasn't about deliberately maintaining Great Ming's nominal authority; it was simply that there really wasn't any building in the entire Changhua County seat that the Senators found acceptable. Rather than staying in a county seat without any infrastructure, it was better to stay in Changhua Fort with its much better environment.

Several months ago, a joint work group dispatched from Lingao came to Changhua for a comprehensive census, registering households, surveying terrain and towns, drawing up land registers, and inevitably arresting a batch of people and executing several. They took complete control of all local land, population, and resources.

After a round of "rectification," the Senate became the master of the entire Changhua County. More than six hundred registered households and an equal number of hidden households all came under the Senate's rule, becoming a labor force to be mobilized at any time.

Due to its small population, Changhua had almost no economy. Although natural resources were abundant, there was currently no capacity to develop them. With neither much military affairs nor civil affairs needing management, the one sent to preside over county government while concurrently serving as Changhua Fort Commander was Kong Lingyang. Kong Lingyang wasn't a Fubo Army officer but a genuine agricultural technician working in the Agricultural Committee. His appointment as Changhua Fort Commander indicated the Senate's positioning of this place.

Kong Lingyang was a "senior general" in the animal husbandry section of the Agricultural Committee. He and Yang Baogui were half-colleagues. Both started as veterinarians and later worked at breeding stations. Although his educational background and work experience were quite impressive—he had even procured a complete set of professional veterinary station tools, various breeding eggs, and quality semen for the transmigrator group back then—after D-Day, he had long been quietly assisting Yang Baogui with animal husbandry work at the Agricultural Committee, unwilling to appear too "professional," lest he be pigeonholed into the "technical personnel" role. From his personal experience in the old dimension, being a "technical person" advanced one's career far slower than being an "administrative person."

Yang Baogui had now become famous in the Senate. Every time the Executive Committee convened expanded meetings on agricultural issues, he had to attend—quite glorious indeed. But ultimately he would pigeonhole himself into a role like "Chief Veterinary Officer"—Kong Lingyang's ambitions didn't lie there.

Several months ago he was dispatched to Changhua to serve as County Office Director and concurrently as Changhua Fort Commander, making him feel he had finally taken the first solid step on his official career. Although this appointment was mainly due to his professional skills—the Planning Bureau currently lacked the capacity for deep development of Changhua, positioning the locality as primarily agricultural and animal husbandry with minor natural resource collection as supplement.

This way, when selecting Changhua's County Office Director, Kong Lingyang, who volunteered, had agricultural and animal husbandry skills, and wasn't a key figure in the Agricultural Committee or Tiandi Society, became the most suitable candidate. Besides, he had at least been a civil servant and had some understanding of administrative operations.

Changhua's status naturally couldn't compare to the large county seats in northern Qiong managed by Liu Xiang and others, but at least the whole county had around a thousand households and a population under ten thousand. There was a reinforced platoon of Marines and a just-formed National Army County Guard Company—the former Changhua Fort militia. Although called a company, there were currently only fifty-odd people, still needing further adjustment and expansion.

The National Army Guard Companies organized in each county mostly recruited personnel locally and were currently only for emergency needs. Once each county's situation stabilized and large numbers of immigrants arrived, the Training Directorate would adjust and rotate all National Army County Guard Companies. According to the plan, each company would have some people serving locally and some serving elsewhere.

At this moment, in the great hall atop the main tower of the bastion, a small banquet was being held to welcome the just-arrived Major Wei Aiwen, Mu Min, Fang Jinghan, and others from the General Staff Political Department.

On the table, more than a dozen steaming dishes were set out, all provided by the local vegetable garden, livestock pens, and fishing boats. Most eye-catching was the heaping platter of roasted lamb skewers, sprinkled with sesame seeds, cumin, and chili peppers, roasted to aromatic perfection. Although eating this dish in the blazing summer of Changhua might be somewhat hard to swallow, for the Senators who were seriously deficient in meat yet had high consumption, climate wouldn't affect appetite.

There was no refrigeration equipment in the room, nor ice, but it was near the seaside and on the third floor. With windows wide open, the sea breeze was refreshing. Plus large quantities of chilled beverages from the well, everyone ate until dripping with hot sweat, exclaiming how satisfying it was.

Except for Mu Min who ate somewhat less, Wei Aiwen and others wolfed everything down. Before long the table was piled with bamboo skewers and many bottles of kvass and rice beer.

Kong Lingyang didn't eat much—food supply here was abundant; he was one of the very few Senators who had meat daily. Kong Lingyang was a chubby man with square-framed glasses, wearing a Lingao-manufactured cotton summer training uniform. While wiping sweat with a towel, he urged everyone to eat and drink.

"Old Kong, the conditions here are really nice." Wei Aiwen had finally eaten his fill. Patting his belly, he picked his teeth while exclaiming in admiration.

"No, no, it's all due to the good leadership of the Senate and Executive Committee..." Kong Lingyang avoided saying Director Wen or Supervisor's names, lest it show too distinct a personal stance. *Never casually take sides before the situation is clear*—this was one of the lessons Kong Lingyang learned from five-plus years of civil servant life.

"Cut the empty talk." Wei Aiwen chuckled, "First to the tower gets the moon first; we're not unreasonable people." He burped and asked the others: "Shall we discuss work matters now?"

Mu Min nodded: "I'm full too; good time to discuss matters."

Fang Jinghan and others naturally had no objections either—everyone had eaten until almost bursting.

Kong Lingyang nodded repeatedly: "Good, good." He instructed people to clear away the leftover dishes, preparing tea and writing materials. He guessed this sudden arrival of "people from the center" was likely related to local Li ethnic affairs.
