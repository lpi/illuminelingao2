# Chapter 740 - Victorious Return

This news did not surprise the Senate; historically, he died at his post around 1631 from overwork.

According to historical progression, the next Governor-General of Liangguang would be Xiong Wencan. He rose to power by pacifying Zheng Zhilong, and throughout his life, he primarily used "pacification" to deal with various "rebel factions." Coming to govern Liangguang, he was very likely to reach a mutual understanding with the Transmigrators. Just as the compromise he reached with Zheng Zhilong in Fujian. Thus, the Senators once looked forward to "Blue Sky" Xiong's assumption of office.

However, Blue Sky Xiong couldn't come just yet—given medieval administrative efficiency, it would take at least three to six months for Xiong Wencan to arrive in Guangdong and take office. The Transmigrators' time was precious; the Senate discussed and decided that rather than waiting eagerly for Blue Sky Xiong, it was better to quickly settle follow-up matters with Li Fengjie, creating a *fait accompli*. Just the Hong Kong issue had caused Li Fengjie to make every excuse, finally exchanging only for a promise of "turning a blind eye." Whether Qiongzhou Prefecture could be completely "Zhongzuosuo-ized" was hard to predict.

Although the situation was still unclear, the Naval Task Force's victorious return from the Pearl River was something to celebrate. A grand welcoming ceremony was held at Bopu Pier.

On this day, colorful flags flew on streetlights along the road from Lingao County City to Bopu—if one looked closely, most were Ming military flags captured in the Battle of Chengmai. Captured flags from the Chengmai battlefield piled up like mountains. The Great Library collected two of each type according to collection principles, then used several hundred more as decorations in the Grand Stadium. Some remaining ones were distributed to hang at the Military Affairs General Court Building and the Ministry of the Navy. Finally, even the Lingao Cathedral hung quite a few military flags.

The rest, if made of cotton or linen, were washed and recycled—even the ragged ones could make paper. Various silk flags were harder to deal with, as Australians didn't use silk for clothes. Aside from a small amount allocated for industrial use, the rest were all allocated to the Propaganda Department upon Fang Fei's application.

Fang Fei organized people to sort these flags, selecting those of uniform size, then outsourcing the processing to remove unwanted content. Finally, he had several hundred colorful flags usable for events.

Now, these colorful flags fluttered all the way from Lingao County City along the Lingao-Bopu Highway. Several banners were strung across the road: "Warmly Welcome Our Pearl River Task Force Officers and Men Returning Victoriously!", "Glory Belong to the Invincible Fubo Army Illuminated by the Senate's Radiance!", "Invincible in Battle, Victorious in Attack!", "The Senate's Radiance Shines Everywhere!"...

Teams of welcoming crowds were heading to Bopu. These were welcoming squads organized by the Mass Activity Division of the Propaganda Department. With the precedent of the Chengmai Victory, this Navy-led campaign victory celebration couldn't be too low-spec, lest the Navy feel slighted. Besides, the Chairman of the Executive Committee was in the returning fleet; it had to be handled at the level of a head of state returning from a working visit.

According to Fang Fei's order, all professional and amateur propaganda groups under the Propaganda Department turned out. "Scale must be grand, atmosphere must be enthusiastic," he instructed his indigenous Section Chief Ji Denggao, "...At least eight classes must be drawn from Fangcaodi. Why only these few classes arrived? No vigor at all! And the Seminary Choir, why arrange them so far forward? We aren't a Catholic country!" The former fortune-teller, wearing the new small-collared cotton "work uniform," sweated from his head while quickly recording instructions in a notebook with a Lingao-made pencil.

Seeing Fang Fei's instructions pause, Ji Denggao hurriedly seized time to report:

"Minister Hu said teaching tasks at Fangcaodi are tight; sending students for celebrations is a wa—" He quickly swallowed his words.

"Pure waste of time, right?" Fang Fei said. Ji Denggao dared not reply; the crime of slandering a Senator could be big or small. If it became "sowing discord," he mostly likely would be sent to Fu Youdi to do mass propaganda. He quickly reorganized his words:

"Minister Hu meant that teaching tasks are too late to catch up; sending too many students affects studies. He didn't say anything else..."

Fang Fei waved his hand: "Enough. Go to Fangcaodi immediately. Say I said it: the Nursing Class and Life Secretary Class students must send one more class each! Go! Ride a public bike!" Fang Fei tore a "Public Vehicle Use Ticket" from his satchel, wrote time and destination, and gave it to Ji Denggao. To improve efficiency, every department, enterprise, and commune level unit was now equipped with public vehicles—agricultural model 28-inch bicycles, commonly known as "28 Big Bars."

This fresh transport tool aroused great interest among indigenous people. After stumbling to learn riding, riding a bicycle became a joy and pride for indigenous cadres. However, since tires were first-level controlled materials, bicycle use was strictly restricted. The General Office's "Public Vehicle Ticket" system meant indigenous cadres rarely enjoyed the pleasure of using public vehicles.

"Understood, I'll go right now." Ji Denggao took the ticket and left. Fang Fei looked out from the temporary Customs Office window. The welcoming crowd was still thin—and the colors were too plain, all gray-blue ants. Without the maid uniforms of the Life Secretary Class and blue nurse uniforms of the Nursing Class, the atmosphere really couldn't rise.

He muttered, "Old Hu, oh Old Hu, don't think no one knows the truth about your 'Education Reform Pilot' and 'Quality Education' at Fangcaodi. If Senators knew, hmph hmph..."

Outside the window, gongs and drums shook the sky; the lion dance team was warming up. Choir teams from various systems also arrived. Pity there was no orchestra—Transmigrators had full sets of instruments and textbooks, even various scores, just no full set of players. They had to use CD playback to make up the numbers.

The Lingao Broadcasting Station's on-site broadcast team occupied an office in the Bopu Customs Building as a broadcast room, preparing for a live broadcast—wired, not wireless, and the most primitive kind: "Talking Trumpets," as locals called the high-pitched loudspeaker system erected in most parts of Lingao.

Right now, the loudspeakers were rotating magnificent Soviet-era marches. This was a "Soviet Marches" disc selected by Li Chiqi's cousin Zhang Yu from a pile of CDs. This short-haired, baby-faced girl had been extricated from the boring telegrapher job at Lingao Telecom—per Organization Department orders, such jobs would gradually be taken over by specially trained indigenous personnel. Zhang Yu had nowhere to go after handover; besides telegraphy learned after arrival, she had no special skills. As a self-proclaimed ultra-leftist, she had no interest in administrative work in offices. Once she was a target for Du Wen's recruitment, becoming her subordinate. But they got along unhappily. Du Wen thought Zhang Yu's "leftist" level too superficial, repeatedly suggesting she read more Stalin works, even lending her personal reading notes for Zhang Yu's "study reference."

Unexpectedly, Zhang Yu had zero interest in these "notes" or Stalin. Compared to Stalin's works, she was more interested in BL (Boys' Love) novels. Within days, Du Wen scoffed at her "leftist" identity. Finally, the two women clashed. With Dong Weiwei pregnant and uninterested in mediating Social Investigation Office interpersonal relations, the conflict intensified.

In a fit of anger, Zhang Yu ran to the Organization Department demanding a transfer. Ming Lang felt the young girl had a lively personality, was eloquent, and good at singing and dancing. Doing propaganda shouldn't be a problem, so she fell to Ding Ding. Becoming a broadcaster at the station.

Now, Zhang Yu lay on the windowsill—this office, modified into a broadcast room, had necessary soundproofing and a window expanded into a large bay window facing Bopu Harbor—facilitating the announcer's observation during live broadcasts. Zhang Yu held dried sweet potato—tribute from Li Chiqi, the cousin who constantly attempted to eat her; in the other hand, dried fish—bought by Zhang Yuchen. Since returning from Guangzhou Station, this man had single-mindedly met "chat friends"—after all, this chat friend had great figure and looks—coming to ask Zhang Yu out every few days.

Zhang Yuchen was 183cm, 77kg, with a standard figure compared to many宅男 (otaku). Plus, during two years in Guangzhou, he hadn't spent a cent of his salary and bonuses, so he was flush with cash. He also brought back many fun and beautiful small crafts from Guangzhou. Calling him "wealthy and handsome," he treated her to casual meals today, coffee tomorrow, coaxing the naive girl into spins.

All this made Li Chiqi intensely jealous—he seduced his cousin into joining the crossing for "personal use," not to be someone's brother-in-law. For this, he repeatedly reminded his cousin: this Zhang Yuchen had very complex male-female issues in Guangzhou. Though he didn't openly take concubines, sexual relations with many maids were habitual—and the maids he brought back, now called Life Secretaries, were living openly in his apartment.

"I didn't plan to marry him." Zhang Yu pouted indifferently. "Just hanging out as friends."

Li Chiqi thought, *How many girls ended up as wives after 'just hanging out as friends'?* He was anxious, ignoring work fatigue to strengthen his pursuit daily, determined to make Zhang Yuchen retreat.

Zhang Yu naturally didn't care about this situation. Someone constantly supplying snacks and accompanying her for fun—what was bad about that?

Finishing her lollipop, she picked up binoculars to gaze outside, looking for fleet entry signals. The fleet returning from Hong Kong was entering port today. The welcoming crowd on the pier had waited since morning. Once ships entered, she had to start live commentary immediately.

"Many big bosses here." Zhang Yu used binoculars to look under the rest shade on the pier trestle. Almost all Executive Committee members were present, standing or sitting with smiles, talking. she checked the list Ding Ding gave her of Executives, Standing Committee members, and Department Heads attending. Twenty-five or six in total. When handing her the list, Ding Ding specifically warned not to read the order wrong or miss anyone.

As a self-proclaimed ultra-leftist, Zhang Yu had some understanding of politics. She understood this was actually a power ranking; though a small matter, the implications were huge. She read the list thoroughly several times, checking against it to see how many listed Senators had arrived.

Just then, amidst drums and bugles, a team of lower-grade students from Fangcaodi National School marched in grandly.

They all wore standard student uniforms—miniature versions of the small-collared labor suit. The only difference was girls wore skirts slightly past the knee—specifically requested by Hu Qingbai. If girls didn't get used to modern skirts from childhood, they wouldn't accustom to sailor suits in middle school.

The chest of the uniform bore the embroidered emblem of "Fangcaodi National School" and the motto: "Knowledge is Power." Cuffs had black stripes with class names and student numbers; Roman numerals on lapels marked the grade.

Zhao Chuanyi held a small paper flag, walking obediently in the ranks. Ten years old this year, a second-grader, he was among the first indigenous children to receive formal schooling in Lingao—studying step-by-step according to the syllabus Hu Qingbai personally compiled. Content-wise, Zhao Chuanyi would be a fourth-grader in the old timeline.

Zhao Chuanyi was the grandson of Steward Zhao of Liu Dalin's household. His father worked for Australians early on and was now a "cadre" in the General Office. All his three children studied in the National School. Zhao Chuanyi was the eldest. Life in National School was both novel and arduous. The education model Transmigrators set was cramming. Besides mandatory two-hour physical exercise daily, classes ran from 7 AM to 5 PM. Night self-study followed—a sea of questions strategy. For children, suspending classes half a day to "Welcome Chiefs" was a very nice entertainment activity.

"Come, you stand here." Indigenous cadres from the Propaganda Department led the team to waiting spots marked with lime, instructing on points of attention. Students listened, half-understanding: basically, cheer and wave flags when warships enter.

Zhao Chuanyi looked curiously at the pier—they rarely had chances to visit. It was a "dangerous place," close to the sea, with many machines and vehicles. Casualties happened easily, so children under 16 were forbidden entry. He looked at the cranes, at the "Saint Ship" on the sea—teachers had taken them to view it from afar during outings.

Now the big iron ship was on the other side of the bay, looking even more massive—like a mountain! A huge iron chain hanging from the bow was thicker than his thigh. *How was such a thing made?* Zhao Chuanyi often pondered this. He was no longer amazed that an iron ship could float, taught the relationship between buoyancy and mass in physics class, demonstrated with tin foil. But he still marveled that humans could build and drive such big ships. Worship of "Senators" grew daily. Teachers said if they studied hard, one day they too could build and drive such big iron ships. This thrilled many students, planting the longing for science in their hearts for the first time.

Lu Yi nudged Zhao Chuanyi secretly: "Look at that big crane! So high, wonder how it was assembled! If built like a pagoda, wouldn't it need a super high scaffold?"

"However high, it can be built. Didn't you hear teacher say the Porcelain Tower of Nanjing is 78 meters high? Built hundreds of years ago," Zhao Chuanyi said.

"That took many years. This big crane took only a few months."

Zhao Chuanyi looked again at the row of steam cranes of various sizes, the mountains of goods, the clouds of ships in the harbor. It felt familiar yet strange... Though an immigrant family, he was a Lingao local growing up here. He clearly remembered visiting here by chance with Master Liu a few years ago. Only desolate smoke and wild grass then, mangroves everywhere on the beach, only small fishing boats in the bay. In three years, it became like this!

"Sigh, so-called 'Science'," Yuan Fei interjected. "There's always principles we don't understand. Ask the teacher about the crane later. How does it lift such heavy things? And that rope, how strong must it be not to break?"

Lu Yi continued probing the mystery: "Heard the rope is made of steel. I can't imagine how steel becomes rope?"

The class monitor turned and shouted: "Stop talking! A Senator is coming."

Ding Ding hurried to the student ranks with four or five indigenous clerks. He suddenly remembered such occasions usually required flower presentation. Flowers were available—a flowerbed by Bopu Health Center had many. Lingao was warm; flowers bloomed year-round. Gathering four or five bouquets was no problem.

"Pick 6 kids immediately, three boys three girls, prepare to present flowers to General Wen and others!" Ding Ding instructed the leading indigenous cadre, then his wife, "Remember to take photos during the presentation!"

"Got it." Pan Pan looked indifferent, fiddling with her DSLR camera.
