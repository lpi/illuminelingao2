# Chapter 60 - Lingao City

Chapter 60 Lingao City

Guo Yi became energetic upon hearing this. No wonder leaders often go abroad. The foreign scriptures chanted by foreign monks are indeed different. Hurriedly pulled Xue Ziliang to ask him to talk about the details here.

Xue Ziliang asked: "Do you know the World Republic case?"

"Not very clear."

"This is a very typical case. I think it fits the current situation very well." This was a strange case that happened in 1960. A man named Fitz Burt, who claimed to be the illegitimate son of Adolf Hitler, founded the so-called World Republic. This person declared in the European media: On December 16, 1960, the Third Flying Saucer Fleet belonging to Venus would land at Berlin Tempelhof Airport. Az, the commander-in-chief of the Space Commando, would immediately declare earthling Fitz Burt as the President of the Supreme Government of the World Republic. President Fitz would immediately demand the surrender of all national armies on earth, destroy all army ammunition depots, and all soldiers would be prohibited from leaving barracks.

This case was no different from all kinds of fraud cases. The only difference was that this Fitz Burt did not have any fraudulent behavior. He truly believed he was the World Republic President chosen by Venusians, so later this person was not prosecuted for any criminal responsibility.

"Is this very similar to the situation we are facing? I believe they feel they have arrived in a new world from top to bottom. In fact, it is very likely that this is just a deserted island harbor in Vietnam waters. Maybe some person with ulterior motives in the organization specially rented it."

"Isn't this a foreign version of being an emperor..." Little Guo yawned, thinking what this was. Since 1949, there have been at least a dozen people claiming to be the true son of heaven in remote corners of our country. He had looked up these materials when he was idle - most cases were very entertaining.

The explanation was not bad, but it still couldn't explain the problem that all signals disappeared. While thinking wildly, the cabin door opened, and someone threw three blankets in.

"Rest well, hit the road tomorrow." The comer notified simply.

"It seems they will move us to another place tomorrow. I have to rest well to have strength to walk tomorrow." Xue Ziliang ate and drank enough, talked nonsense for a while, was already sleepy, wrapped himself in a blanket and slept. Salina hadn't spoken all the time, and was also asleep now.

As a true Chinese, Little Guo had a deep understanding of the profundity of the Chinese language. "Hit the road" (Shang Lu - also means dying/going to execution) was really an ominous word for people deep in such an environment.

Meng Xian, who threw the blankets in, obviously didn't realize that his unintentional sentence made Little Guo sleepless for half the night, scribbling and rewriting several pages of suicide note on a small notebook.

Into the night, Lingao County seat was dead silent.

After the watch started, the city had been under curfew and street cleared. The dark city appeared particularly gloomy. Soldiers stood at the intersections of the stone slab roads running through the city, ready to interrogate pedestrians - many people had poured in from the four countryside and outside the city today, dragging families, some bringing pigs, cattle, chickens, ducks, cats and dogs. The county had opened all temples along the road to accommodate these refugee farmers. There were still many people sleeping on both sides of the stone slab roads. Even animals probably knew disaster was imminent, rarely barking. Only ignorant children were still crying, scolded by adults in low voices.

Red or white paper lanterns hung outside the government offices and temples. The light was dim, swaying under the eaves. Under the weak light, notices could be seen posted on the walls. From time to time, watchmen carrying small lanterns and beating clappers walked by with a few militia.

The city wall was very quiet. There was a lantern every short distance. Militia patrolled back and forth on the city wall. Since Bopu beacon tower warned early in the morning, and then Inspector Fu fled back in panic, the atmosphere in the city became unusually tense. People were whispering in the shadows of the streets from time to time.

"Could the pirates have retreated already?" Someone spoke softly under the eaves.

"No news from villages yet, hard to say."

"This group of pirates usually leave after grabbing a ticket. Maybe the ships have gone by now."

"If they really left, would Grand Master Wu still send people to ask for help?" Someone said mysteriously, "This afternoon, Assistant Magistrate Master Wu went to the Rear Camp to ask for reinforcements."

(Rear Camp, i.e., the Rear Camp Tuntian under the Hainan Interior Guard Five Thousand Households, located in Lingao County, with two tuntian places.)
"Pirates' power is so big?" A black and thin man was uneasy. This was a Shegeng person (Note: Shegeng person, originally Fujianese, rents land to farm. Descendants all have Fujian accent), who finally accumulated a little family property by reclaiming wasteland in Lingao. Last year he just married a wife in his hometown and brought her over. At this moment his wife was hugging a piglet tightly. Beside her in two big bamboo cages, the smell of chicken and duck shit was pungent, but she didn't care at all.

"Not big, but very big." A person looking like a small peddler probably had seen some world, speaking vividly, "In these years, the ocean surface of Guangdong and Guangxi hasn't been peaceful. Yang Er, Liu Xiang, official troops can't do anything to them. Commander Yu suppressed them don't know how many times, losing more than winning. Heard the court is discussing amnesty."

"It will be peaceful after amnesty, right." Someone said.

"Peaceful, I don't think so." The small peddler said indignantly, "That Yang Er was amnestied once, but still harmed common people. Every time I crossed the sea in these two years, I hung my heart. Fu San of Cancun Du was killed when crossing the sea, didn't even have a corpse..."

"This group of pirates won't attack the county seat, right?"

"Besieging the county seat was during the Li rebellion in Tinan Village thirty years ago. My grandfather was conscripted as a militia to defend the city. Those Li people were all like crazy, attacking the city with a sea of people. Later Ma Shi came again. Although didn't attack the city, the city gate didn't dare to open either." (Note: Tinan Village Li people riot was in the 25th year of Wanli, Ding'an Li person Ma Shi riot was in the 27th year of Wanli)

"This time should also pass safely and soundly, right."

While talking, the Police Master was walking through the street with a few people. Seeing this group of people talking lively, he couldn't help shouting loudly: "Barbarians talking nonsense, if talk nonsense again, see if this official doesn't punish you for disturbing people's hearts!"

(Note: In Ming Dynasty Hainan, city people called rural people barbarians, rural people called city people Chifu. Of course, all were curses.)
Once the master showed his power, everyone dared not make a sound. Since the martial law started early this morning, about ten unlucky guys had been pulled to be beaten with boards or put in cangue for public display because of saying a few more words or looking a few more times.

Seeing the Police Master take people far away, that small peddler muttered: "Only know to show power to small common people. Go fight pirates if have ability..."

"You say less!" An old man stopped him, "When is this? Chewing this useless tongue."

Tonight, the Lingao Magistrate was sitting in the flower hall. His name was Wu Mingjin, a native of South Zhili, nearing fifty years old, hair already greying. He was originally a Juren, but failed in the examination field, not passing even in his forties. Picked as a magistrate in the grand selection, still to this southern border remote place. Although Lingao had been established as a county for a long time, even counting from the relocation of the county seat to Mocun, it had been five hundred years. But in the eyes of him, a South Zhili person, it was still a barren land. Since taking office, he also wanted to strive to do something for the common people, build water conservancy, reclaim wasteland, encourage agriculture and mulberry... leave a virtuous name. But in these years, natural and man-made disasters continued. Coastal beacon towers alarmed several times a month, either Bopu or Shipai, Maniao. Pirates attacked everywhere. Official troops were helpless. The county had to close doors and defend, responding with the strategy of "thieves leave when full". Last autumn there was a typhoon again. Countless village houses were destroyed. People were displaced. He ordered people to set up porridge sheds and collect ownerless corpses, but still an epidemic broke out and many people died.

(Note: Checking Lingao County Annals, there were five recorded magistrates during Tianqi-Chongzhen years. Among them, Ye Yao and Wu Mingjin were in office at the end of Tianqi - beginning of Chongzhen. Because the start and end times cannot be verified, the latter one is used.)
Originally, this beacon tower alarm, he didn't take it too seriously. Pirate harassment was already a common meal here. But the words Fu Bowan said when fleeing back with archers really scared him not lightly.

The pirates came in unprecedented "giant ships". The hull was higher than the Dacheng Hall of Lingao Confucian Temple. The following ships were each bigger than the warships of official troops. None used sails or oars, coming and going freely on the sea, like divine skills.

The most incredible thing was that those ships were actually made of iron! Iron giant ships floating on water, this greatly exceeded his understanding range. People have instinctive fear of things beyond their understanding.

When seeing these people really start landing, Fu Bowan hurriedly took people to run back to the county seat wildly - he instinctively predicted that these people were not the same thing as any pirates or merchants he had seen or heard of before. They couldn't have come to Lingao just to rob common people of a few piculs of salted fish and a few shi of rice!
Of course Wu Mingjin couldn't listen to his one-sided words only - warriors fear war, exaggeration is a common thing. In panic, he still sent a runner of Tanka origin familiar with the situation near Bopu in the county yamen to visit. When coming back at noon, that runner couldn't even speak smoothly. From his chaotic description, Grand Master Wu knew that this group of pirates had a large number, over a thousand. After landing, there were carts that could walk on the beach. The carts didn't harness horses or drive cattle. People sitting on them would go. Some carts could easily lift very very big iron boxes and move them around... and many things he couldn't explain clearly... in a word, this group of people was full of evil spirit.

Now he was anxious. He didn't believe much in evil arts and the like. Wu Mingjin came to Hainan to be an official, seeing Portuguese big ships and cannons in Guangdong on the way, and also seeing telescopes. He knew overseas people had many strange and ingenious things. Who knew if this group of pirates would rely on some overseas strange things to attack the county seat? In Lingao city, besides runners and yamen runners, available were only eighty militia plus twelve archers returned from the inspection station, totaling just over one hundred people.

So he hurriedly asked Assistant Magistrate Wu Ya to take silver to the Rear Camp to move reinforcements. At this moment Wu Ya came back to report: The Chiliarch of the Rear Camp agreed, and would send thirty people and one cannon over tomorrow morning, only after the event, each person had to be given a reward of one shi of rice.
