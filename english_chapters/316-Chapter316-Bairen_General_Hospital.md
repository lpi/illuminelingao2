# Chapter 316 - Bairen General Hospital

Taking in a maid wasn't a big deal. If she was really as good as she said, then just let Chen Tianxiong use her—he didn't have a woman anyway.

"Alright, tell her to come over tomorrow and we'll see," Wen Tong said nonchalantly.

"Thank you, Master, for your grace!" Ah Zhu arched her body fawningly, slowly sliding down towards Wen Tong's crotch. She gently took him into her mouth and gave a slight lick with the tip of her tongue. He shuddered all over and immediately stood erect again.

*I'll have to teach her some fresh tricks later.* Wen Tong's consciousness gradually blurred under the sensation; this thought flashed through his mind before he sank into the climax of bliss.

"The Dean is making rounds!"

As soon as the Head Nurse's high-pitched voice rang out in the corridor, every ward and office of Bairen General Hospital tensed up. This was the routine Dean’s Grand Rounds every Monday morning. All chief physicians had to attend. The first batch of Health School graduates, who had just been capped and promoted to nurses, and their juniors—the second batch of Health School interns—hurriedly opened the ward doors and stood in the corridor. Holding their breath and concentrating, they stood respectfully, awaiting the arrival of the figure who was like a god in their hearts.

As the main door of the Chief's Office building opened, Shi Niaoren walked out, one hand in the pocket of his brand-new white coat, his broad shoulders and imposing figure leading the procession. A step behind him were the department chiefs. Each with a taut face, their white medical coats ironed crisp and straight—ironing clothes for the chief physicians was one of the duties of the nurses at Bairen General Hospital—and stethoscopes hanging around their necks, shining brightly.

"Good morning, Doctors!" Led by Head Nurse Zhang Ziyi, all nurses and interns bowed and greeted in unison. Although the scene was small, it was quite spectacular.

"Good morning. Thank you for your hard work!" Shi Niaoren nodded. The chiefs always felt a bit gloomy at this moment—after all, there was only one person who could say "Comrades, thank you for your hard work." The inspection team was customarily led by Shi Niaoren, the highest-ranking People's Commissar of Health and Dean of Bairen General Hospital. Shi Niaoren held the titles of a US-educated Ph.D. and Professor of Infectious Diseases, occupying a high position even in this new timeline.

The entire inpatient building had three floors. The first and second floors were ordinary wards, with ten rooms on each floor and six beds per room. The third floor was the "Senior Cadre Ward"—actually reserved for transmigrators. It also had ten rooms, but only three beds each.

Currently, about thirty people were admitted to the ordinary wards, mostly with muscle contusions, fractures, traumatic infections, and common illnesses like upper respiratory infections with fever or acute gastroenteritis. In recent days, a batch of wounded had been admitted—sailors and artillerymen from the *Great Whale* injured in the Battle of Juhua Islet. They mostly suffered from minor burns and puncture wounds from iron shrapnel.

Most didn't need hospitalization; they would be fine once their wounds were treated. Only a few had severe injuries. Such injuries, as long as they didn't damage major blood vessels or organs, weren't hard to treat. Even fighting inflammation was much easier than in the other timeline—antibiotics like sulfonamides worked almost instantly.

The only thing that troubled the doctors was tetanus antitoxin—this item was becoming scarcer, and its shelf life was limited. Once used up, the wounded would have to rely on luck.

For general patients, the inspection ended with checking the medical chart at the bedside and asking if there were any abnormalities. Even in such basic and simple matters, Shi Niaoren would often find problems.

"Why doesn't this patient have a morning temperature reading?!" Dean Shi started to flare up again—how many times had he emphasized this! "Who is on duty?"

"Reporting to Master—"

"Dean!" Shi Niaoren roared. "Say it again: call me Dean!" Hearing this address, he knew it was a Health School student. Formal nurses wouldn't call him "Master."

"It's me—" The Health School girl who was called out wore a blue nurse uniform. Since she wasn't a formal nurse, she only wore a blue triangular kerchief.

"Who are you?"

"Hou Qing."

Hou Qing looked thin and small. In the other timeline, she would likely be considered fifteen or sixteen, but she was actually in her early twenties, considered an old maid in this timeline. She and her brother, Hou Wenyong, were refugees recently taken in by the Guangzhou Station.

"Why didn't you take the temperature?"

"Shame, shame to death—" The girl actually covered her face, looking like she was about to cry.

It turned out that to avoid patients biting off thermometers, temperatures here were taken rectally. In other words, the nurse had to "violate" the patient's rear.

It was certain that patients weren't used to it, but asking these young women born in an era where "men and women should not touch" to perform such an act on a grown man they had never met was even more difficult.

Initially, there was a suggestion to start with a male nurse system, but Shi Niaoren rejected it outright: "You all know very well: medical workers have no gender! If they can't even step over this threshold, what's the point of talking about training qualified indigenous medical personnel?"

Of course, such things couldn't be achieved overnight. Nine out of ten new students couldn't accept it at first. They had to be educated slowly. Shi Niaoren sighed and said to Zhang Ziyi:

"Teach her well."

Saying this, he walked to the next bed.

"What is this about?!"

Every ward round would uncover some problems, more or less. Either basic temperatures were forgotten, or medical records were written wrongly. The first batch of Health School graduates were actually still very immature in many aspects—they had learned in less than half a year what their counterparts in the other timeline took four years to finish; many had just risen above the level of illiteracy.

After scolding the nurse who made the mistake and watching her correct it on the spot, Shi Niaoren exhaled: *There is progress.* At least the nurses no longer knelt on the ground begging for his "mercy" as soon as they heard his reprimand like in the past. Instilling modern medical concepts was truly a heavy responsibility with a long way to go.

After visiting the ordinary wards, the group arrived at the Senior Cadre Ward, where only two people were staying.

"You Laohu, Army Company Commander. Acute enteritis," reported the nurse on duty, Guo Fu.

Shi Niaoren took the medical record and looked at it. Although the handwriting was crooked, the format was standard. Fasting temperature at 6 AM was 37.4 degrees. A bit feverish.

He handed the medical record to Lan Yangyang, the gastroenterology specialist.

"Did you have diarrhea last night?"

"Twice."

Lan Yangyang checked again and asked some questions about the condition.

This guy got acute enteritis from eating wild fruits during field training yesterday. His face was green when he was carried in. Lan Yangyang busied himself for half the night to bring him around. He was still on a glucose drip.

"It's fine, it's fine. Guaranteed to be healthy and lively later," Shi Niaoren comforted the mournful-faced You Laohu amiably.

"Don't eat anything today. Drink some rice porridge tonight, rest for a night, and you'll be jumping around tomorrow." Lan Yangyang wanted to give You Laohu reassurance.

"Thank you, Doctor." You Laohu, who usually always wanted to flirt with the little nurses in the hospital, had no strength at all. Even with a little nurse in front of him, he couldn't muster any interest.

"Tell the Army Club to get a duck to nourish your body when you get back, hehe." Shi Niaoren was all smiles. "Don't eat things like wild fruits anymore."

"Definitely won't eat them—" You Laohu, usually strong as an ox, was now weak even in speech. Indeed, a hero cannot withstand three bouts of diarrhea.

Shi Niaoren didn't have such a good tone when he walked to the other bed. A fat man lay on the bed, groaning, but his complexion was shockingly good.

"I say, Fatty Xi!" Shi Niaoren was blunt as soon as he opened his mouth—this guy had checked in after returning from the *Great Whale*. Actually, it was just a minor injury, not even needing stitches, completely below the standard for hospitalization. "How long are you going to mooch here?"

"Doctor, I feel a bit of muscle twitching. Could it be the first stage of tetanus?" He lay there, groaning.

"You are very healthy!" Shi Niaoren said. "How many times have I told you, all transmigrators have received tetanus immunization. Your wound isn't deep, and the medic treated it. Where would tetanus come from?!"

"That's not guaranteed either." Xi Yazhou said feebly. "For the sake of the Party and the State, just give me a shot of serum..."

He had said this several times over the past few days. Shi Niaoren shook his head helplessly. It seemed he wouldn't leave without an injection. But he was unwilling to use the limited serum on someone with no illness—they couldn't manufacture this serum; one less vial used was one less vial left.

"Fine, I'm scared of you," he said. "Get discharged after the shot." Leaving the ward, he called Zhang Ziyi over:

"Give him an injection of saline. Make it hurt a bit! Just tell him it's serum."

Having dealt with this matter, Shi Niaoren returned to his Dean's office and lit a cigarette—as a doctor, he didn't need to smoke "Holy Ship" brand cigarettes. All the heavy smokers in the health department smoked filter cigarettes brought from the other timeline. Naturally, these were gifts from grateful patients.

*Everything is hard in the beginning!* Shi Niaoren watched the smoke rings rise. The transmigrators were quite proud of their health department, and this pride was justified. In this timeline, the medical knowledge, skills, and specific drugs they possessed were enough to make every doctor in the Ministry of Health a "Miracle Doctor." But they were truly not omnipotent.

When that transmigrator, who accidentally fell off the city wall due to excessive excitement during the attack on Gou Family Village, died silently in the medical team's tent, Shi Niaoren and all medical workers felt a strong sense of powerlessness for the first time. The traumatic brain injury this person suffered might have been salvageable in the other timeline, but here they could only watch him die helplessly.

At the time, fearing it would affect morale and with the approval of the Executive Committee, the body of this obscure transmigrator was quietly buried in the wasteland behind Bopu Health Center, waiting for a suitable opportunity to be reburied in the Martyrs' Cemetery. Fortunately, they hadn't been ashore for long then, and personnel transfers were frequent, so this person was quickly forgotten.

"But, it can't always be like this," Shi Niaoren said silently. There were a thousand things to do.

Since the completion of the infrastructure for Bairen General Hospital, Shi Niaoren began to consider establishing a rudimentary medical system. They lacked neither basic equipment nor medicines; although doctors were few and their specialties somewhat unbalanced, they could manage. But they didn't have a complete medical system—no, forget complete, not even a primary one.

After several discussions, the Health Department decided to first build up the Bairen General Hospital system to perfection, serving as a model unit for all future medical institutions—just like the demonstration farm Wu Nanhai set up.

Currently, thanks to their efforts, this general hospital had five basic departments: Internal Medicine, Surgery, Infectious Diseases, ENT, and Traditional Chinese Medicine. It had a pharmacy, a radiology room, and a laboratory center. They also took over the sanitation class originally under the Military and Political School system and established a Health School, training a batch of nurses and military medics. Of course, in terms of level, these people were not even as good as the barefoot doctors trained in the 1970s, but it was better than nothing.

Several doctors were all given the title of Chief Physician; of course, no one among the transmigrators was more suitable than them. However, these Chief Physicians of Bairen General Hospital couldn't be as fastidious as doctors in big hospitals. They had no flock of graduate or undergraduate students to do the grunt work. There wasn't even a qualified pharmacist. Taking X-rays, doing ultrasounds... they even had to guest-star in compounding medicines themselves.

Qian Shuiting's wife, Ai Beibei, was originally not an outpatient doctor; she was actually engaged in pathological research in epidemiology. Now she had to temporarily guest-star as a gynecologist again. Even modern women from the 21st century were often unwilling to accept examinations by male gynecologists, let alone now in the 17th century.

For the most common internal medicine and infectious diseases, due to the lack of professional doctors, Shi Niaoren wrote "Guidelines for the Treatment of Common Diseases in Hainan." He ranked common diseases: Intestinal Diseases - Respiratory Diseases - Malaria - Surface Bacterial Infections - Gynecological Diseases... then detailed treatment measures for each, improving treatment efficiency and avoiding misdiagnosis.

Medical record formats had to be handwritten by doctors personally to serve as models for nurses and future interns. Drug use was institutionalized: all specific drugs and non-routine drugs could not be used without his approval; anesthetic dosage had to stick close to the lower limit of the theoretical dose... Anesthesiology is actually a critical specialty where lack of skill costs lives, but none of them were very good at it—sigh, if something happened, there wouldn't even be a chance for resuscitation.

As for the laboratory center, Shi Niaoren hoped to expand it—to be able to perform medical testing, disease prevention, compile disease prevention manuals, and formulate reasonable disease control strategies. However, a disease prevention and control system required administrative power for support; it would have to wait until the organizational framework was decided.

Finally, there was the matter of the pharmaceutical factory starting production. This matter could be said to create no delay. The glass factory could now provide them with enough specialized equipment. The bacterial strains brought by He Ping's wife were still in the laboratory. These things couldn't be stored for long and had to be put into production as soon as possible. Chemical pharmaceuticals couldn't be counted on for the time being...

"Dean, everyone is here. Shall we start?"
