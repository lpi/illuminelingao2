# Chapter 1252 - Meeting the Enemy

The rout of the fire ship fleet slowed the tempo of the First Squadron. Ming Qiu ordered speed reduced to 3 knots, sailing west to avoid the smoke on the battlefield. At the same time, he needed to let the ships rest and refit. Especially the engineering department: frequent acceleration since morning had overwhelmed the boilers. Many pipes and valves had sprung leaks, large amounts of clinker couldn't be cleared in time, and malfunctions were frequent.

Cannons also needed bores cleaned after a morning of fighting. Ming Qiu signaled for ship captains to meet on *Lichun*. Checking ammunition reserves, and reallocating shells among ships based on status to ensure sufficient firepower for the next step of attacking Xiamen.

At 10:30, Ming Qiu ordered all ships to have lunch early. 15 minutes later, the First Squadron approached Xiamen Island.

Xiamen Island was already in chaos. The battle situation in Xiamen Bay could be barely seen from high places on Xiamen Island, but smoke soon obscured the battlefield, and the distance was too great to see clearly. It wasn't until a fire ship escaping back from the sea arrived at Xiamen Island that panic was triggered across the island.

Carried on the fire ship was Zheng Lian, who had jumped into the water to escape in time. He was not only soaked through, but the back of his clothes was scorched by flames, looking extremely wretched.

Zheng Lian ignored his wretched appearance; upon coming ashore he demanded a fast horse, mounted, cracked the whip, and headed straight for Zhongzuosuo City.

People on shore watched fire ships returning from the sea in twos and threes, everyone terrified out of their wits. Some didn't even dock at Xiamen Island, fleeing directly toward the mainland. Amidst the panic, a Fujian ship with a hole blown in its hull, one mast fallen, sails mostly burnt, stumbled to the dock. The deck was a miserable sight. The crowd originally gathered at the dock seemed to suddenly wake up, instantly scattering in an uproar. Running clean away. Even the soldiers on duty at the dock fled to the last man.

Xiamen Island was the Zheng family's main foreign trade port. Back then Zheng Zhilong attacked Moon Harbor multiple times, burning districts and seizing ships, with the goal of forcing maritime merchants to transfer trade to Xiamen. Although this island wasn't very big, benefitting from prosperous foreign trade, the economy was quite booming. A large commercial district had formed outside Zhongzuosuo City.

Zheng family docks and warehouses here were lined up along the wharf, goods piled like mountains. At this time, quite a few merchant ships were still anchored at the dock, some under the Zheng banner, some belonging to merchants just trading here. Hearing the "Hair Rebel" grand army attacking, from merchants to sailors, everyone lost their souls. Some seeing their ship's panic could not be saved, beat their chests and stomped their feet, wailing loudly. The dock instantly shook with crying.

At this time, inside Zhongzuosuo City was also chaos. The terrified atmosphere brought by Zheng Lian rushing into the walled city on a fast horse infected the entire city. Inside Zhongzuosuo, wealthy families supported the old and carried the young, leaving the city with big and small bags, preparing to hide in the mountains. While poor commoners outside the city surged into the city, hoping to escape the "Hair Rebels" under the protection of the city walls.

For a time, the city gate was packed tight. Those leaving and entering shoved each other with all their might. Example of the old, weak, women, and children being pushed down, trampled injured, or even trampled to death. Zheng soldiers guarding the gate were at a loss, only shouting loudly, but to no avail.

The magistrate's main hall in the center of the walled city was now Zheng Zhilong's council hall. Although Zheng Zhilong was already the Five Tigers Guerilla General, putting on official airs everywhere, he still hadn't shed the pirate habits of a sea lord. Rules weren't too particular. In the courtyard below the hall steps, Zheng family main generals gathered in groups of three or five. Inside the council hall, the backbones of the Zheng group—most of the so-called "Eighteen Chi"—were discussing matters. Their faces all revealed an expression of imminent disaster.

The atmosphere in the hall was dull and oppressive. Even when Li Kuiqi took away most of Zheng Zhilong's subordinates and Zheng Zhilong was once reduced to the predicament of having only "three hundred soldiers," the members of the "Eighteen Chi" still believed their big brother could turn the tide and regroup.

But now they had lost that confidence. The news brought by the panting Zheng Lian made everyone realize how terrifying their opponent was.

Zheng Lian wasn't a novice in battle for the first time, but an old brother who participated in the Eighteen Chi swore brotherhood. He definitely wasn't a coward who would brag about how formidable the enemy was after losing a battle—if he said the Hair Rebels were "unstoppable," then they must be unstoppable.

"Everyone stop looking like your parents died," Zheng Zhilong broke the silence in the council hall. " The Hair Rebels are right on the sea outside, just a gust of wind away from Xiamen. Say what we should do!"

"Xiamen is the key to Quanzhou. If abandoned, Quanzhou and Zhangzhou will be in precarious danger like piled eggs. We absolutely cannot account to the Governor," Zheng Zhifeng coughed and said, seeing many present had intentions of abandoning defense.

"Now news has come from Kinmen, the whole army annihilated, Second Master Mang's life and whereabouts unknown. Brother Lian lost another battle, lacking ships, how to fight the Hair Rebels again?" Someone raised an objection. "In my humble opinion, better to send someone to negotiate quickly while the Hair Rebels haven't landed yet, persuading them to withdraw troops—we are court troops after all, you brothers all have official status, I presume they dare not act rashly."

"Withdraw troops?" Zheng Zhibao sneered. "Hair Rebels put up such a big array, could they be scared back by a few words from you? If Hair Rebels feared officials, could they have fought to Guangzhou back then?"

"Promise them profit..."

Zheng Zhifeng shook his head: "You're thinking of ceding territory and paying indemnities. Spending some money is a small matter—what the Hair Rebels have their eyes on isn't our money, but this Xiamen Island! Even if we wanted to cede territory, there's nowhere to cede!" He stood up, looking at everyone saying, "We brothers have been sworn since the fifth year of Tianqi until now, following Big Brother to conquer this territory. Speaking of it now, every one of us is wealthy enough to rival the state. But apart from these few small islands, where is our footing on the mainland? The Hair Rebels are fighting to dig up our roots now. Xiamen Island is everyone's root! If the root is gone, we brothers will have no footing in the future, what talk of roaming the four seas?"

Zheng Zhilong nodded secretly. Zheng Zhifeng spoke reasonably. Xiamen Island was the foundation of his rise. How much spirit and effort he spent back then to occupy this island for himself; how could he easily give it up to the Hair Rebels?

At this time someone else supported Zheng Zhifeng: "We can't run. The silver, grain, and goods on this island can't be moved in a short while. Are we leaving them all here to benefit the Hair Rebels? If so, we brothers won't even have our underpants left!"

The group instantly burst into wild laughter; the heavy atmosphere lightened somewhat.

A smile also appeared at the corner of Zheng Zhilong's mouth. He said, "Zhifeng is right. This is our brothers' lair, an even more important place than Anping. How can we leave it to the Hair Rebels? However fierce the Hair Rebel ships are, they can't sail onto shore."

"Exactly, Big Brother!" Zheng Zhifeng, hearing him support himself, became even more spirited. He was incompatible with the Hair Rebels—he was the mastermind behind several operations against the Hair Rebels—"Kinmen is lost; if Xiamen is not held, we will have no footing! On Xiamen Island, we still have ten thousand troops, a dozen Red Barbarian Cannons. As long as we are willing to give heavy rewards, the brothers will surely fight to the death. The Hair Rebels fled from afar; how many troops can they bring? Just wait for them to come ashore; we ten fight their one, even trading lives we'll exhaust them!"

The so-called ten thousand troops on the island was a nominal number. In reality, besides troops guarding various stockades, usable local braves were no more than four thousand. However, generals of each family had personal guards and house servants totaling about a thousand. Especially the black guard and Japanese guard recruited by Zheng Zhilong himself—including several Portuguese officers. All were professional soldiers, well-equipped and well-trained, considered elite by standards of the time.

Besides local braves, Zheng fleet sailors ashore could also make up numbers, adding up to several thousand. But this group hadn't received land warfare training, unfamiliar with ranks, only good for fighting with the wind. Zheng Zhifeng was purely exaggerating to boost morale.

However, taking the Hair Rebel land forces transported by five ships, at most there were only one thousand men. Ten fighting one was boasting; four or five fighting one was no problem.

Everyone had heard Australian naval forces were fierce—now witnessing it with their own eyes. But they had little perceptual knowledge of how strong the Australian Army was. He Rubin's great defeat on Hainan Island remained only vague rumors, not precise. Eighteen Chi members, following their habitual thinking, thought they were just an army slightly stronger than government troops—these days defeating government troops wasn't rare—the Zheng family had defeated government troops many times, and government troops suppressing rebellions on land sometimes had to beg the Zheng family to send troops to assist.

Xiamen Island was their home field. Besides Zhongzuosuo City, the Zheng group built multiple camp stockades here, stockpiling large amounts of gunpowder and grain. Rations and pay were enough to support over ten years. Even if land warfare failed, as long as they retreated to defend the walled stockades, the Australians penetrating deep alone wouldn't dare stay long. As long as they held the stockades fast, they would have to withdraw in ten days or half a month.

Immediately it was decided to defend Xiamen to the death. Scouts were sent out to various coasts—multiple camp stockades and beacon towers were built along the Xiamen coast, but Zheng Zhilong wasn't reassured, sending additional scouts to patrol the coastline to prevent Hair Rebels sending surprise troops to land and assault. Secondly, gather main forces at Zhongzuosuo. Besides local braves, plus various family house guards and his private guard, totaling four thousand men. Once Hair Rebels were discovered landing, engage outside Zhongzuosuo City.

Everyone knew Hair Rebel ships were sturdy and guns sharp, so Zheng Zhilong decided not to meet the enemy at the coast—to avoid injury by enemy cannon fire—but to engage in a deeper zone. Since Hair Rebels landed on Xiamen Island, they would inevitably view Zhongzuosuo as the primary target. Engaging under their own city walls, waiting at ease for the fatigued enemy.
