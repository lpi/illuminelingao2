# Chapter 92: New Farm (Part 2)

"Your stamina is really well-maintained."

"You make me sound ancient—I'm only thirty!"

"Huh?"

"This is what happens when you work at the grassroots long enough." Yang Baogui's smile was sunny. "Let's walk together." He called out: "Beibei, go! Bring Ukraine back!" At his shout, a dog sprinted off and herded a large white pig trying to gnaw tree bark back to the road.

"It's called Beibei?"

"That's right—six total, exactly: 'Beibei,' 'Jingjing,' 'Huanhuan,' 'Yingying,' 'Nini.'"

"What's the sixth?" Wu Nanhai, infected by his strange humor, was eager to learn.

"Aoyun—Olympics." Yang Baogui said with a straight face, then yelled: "Aoyun!" A quietly walking dog suddenly bounded to his feet, circling joyfully. He contentedly stroked its neck fur.

"You really know how to train dogs."

"It's my specialty—not my profession. Just for fun." Yang Baogui cracked the whip, snapping it sharply. "I can also drive wagons. Learned from farmers in the countryside. But there aren't any here. I went to the Industrial Group—asked them to make some rubber-wheeled wagons; hitch our captured Yunnan ponies, and a two-horse team could pull a thousand *jin* easy. These people hemmed and hawed about how such carts are backward—they're 'working hard' to develop some four-wheeled farm cart. All nonsense—can small horses even pull those?"

"Tieling draft horses could definitely pull them." Wu Nanhai eyed two especially tall, robust heavy horses in the column. These were the best draft horses bred in China since 1949—carrying bloodlines from Europe's finest cart and riding horses. Maximum pulling force: 450 kg. One horse could pull a 1000-kg loaded double-rubber-wheeled wagon.

"They could, but these two must be kept as studs—shouldn't work too hard. Besides, Tieling draft horses have actually deteriorated significantly." *(Note: Tieling draft horse breeding stopped in the 1990s; only a few degraded studs now exist. The breed will soon disappear.)* Yang Baogui sighed. "Nanhai, honestly, I'm very worried about our Agriculture Group."

"Mm, I also sense some problems, but there are so many threads—where to even start?" He imitated Yang Baogui, waving a willow branch to herd livestock.

"Nanhai, you studied agriculture—surely you know what underlies modern agriculture's high yields?"

"Pesticides, fertilizers, improved varieties, irrigation, GMOs, soil chemistry..." Wu Nanhai said.
"Can that model be replicated here?"

"Difficult. Conditions are too poor. Large-scale irrigation and promoting improved varieties are more realistic yield-boosting measures." Wu Nanhai pondered. "Fertilizer is somewhat manageable—once the Chemistry Group builds ammonia and sulfuric-acid plants. But pesticides are hard—need an organic chemical industry. I think without thirty or forty years of industrial buildup, it's impossible."

"No." Yang Baogui shook his head. "Those problems are superficial. The biggest issue is that modern society is a massive division-of-labor system—agriculture included. Under this system, our agricultural technicians' practical abilities have actually deteriorated—and farmers too.

"Before, farmers had to select and cultivate their own seeds. Now they just buy seeds directly. Agricultural technicians really only know which seeds to use, how to manage after sowing, when to apply which pesticides, what fertilizers...

"Here, there's no seed company, no pesticide factory, no veterinary drug factory, no agricultural machinery station... Everything must be done ourselves. We were all trained within this division-of-labor system—only knowing our own part. Modern agriculture is a complete chain, and we only have scattered links."

He pointed at the dogs herding pigs: "Take those pigs—Georgia! Where are you going?!" Yang Baogui shouted, whipping a pig back onto the road. "Everyone expects these to start large-scale pig farming so we can eat meat every meal. Nobody knows how many vaccines a piglet gets from birth to market in modern pig farms, how much medication, how many disinfectants are used just for the pens. Even then, if a swine plague breaks out, they die in droves."

Wu Nanhai grew worried. He'd thought about these issues but never this deeply.

"Seems like we'll have to rebuild everything piece by piece." He looked at the carefree pigs grunting, foraging as they walked. "They have names too?"

"Yes—all are breeding boars and sows. Names make them easier to remember."

"What are they called?"

"Ukraine, Big Bobo, Georgia, Russia—"

"Ha! Russia must be that boar?" Wu Nanhai pointed at the largest, fiercest pig.

"No—that one's called Soviet Union."

The two chatted as they walked. The ten-plus kilometers of simple road were well-maintained—dusty after vehicles passed, but pleasant for herding livestock. On one side, the rushing Wenlan River; on two-bank fields, rice ears had ripened, but without the familiar rolling golden waves—agriculture here was quite backward. Wu Nanhai walked and sighed, thinking about how to turn everyone's knowledge into productivity—yet obstacles piled up before him.

The road was peaceful. Occasionally local people worked distant fields, but far away. Several watchtowers along the route gave passing transmigrators great security. These originally rough wooden towers had been rebuilt as three-story brick-and-stone pillboxes with searchlights on top. Below, open ground surrounded by deep trenches and barbed wire—if any attack happened, road transmigrators and vehicles could quickly shelter inside.

The entire marching column took nearly three hours to reach Bairren Rapids camp. All Agriculture Committee members awaited them—today was the Committee's official move-in day.

Unlike departments already installed in the Committee Building compound, the Agriculture Committee was housed entirely in what became known as "Nanhai Model Demonstration Farm." Wu Nanhai had learned in university: agriculture isn't created sitting in offices writing plans and reports, but through every technician walking step by step through fields, fish ponds, and orchards. As an agricultural technician, you must live near farmland.

The entire farm compound was built with the brick kiln's newest red bricks—probably the grandest building complex in all of Bairren Fortress: offices, agricultural-tech labs, warehouses, machinery station, cellars, neatly arranged granaries. By the river: a water-powered mill; newly built animal pens fragrant with fresh lumber. The only concrete structure was a row of pressure-type biogas digesters—processing waste, wastewater, and manure from residential and agricultural zones. The biogas supplied the cafeteria for cooking. When waste increased later, more biogas could generate electricity. Biogas slurry served as fertilizer or feed additive; final residue was excellent fertilizer.

The original plan included a permanent glass greenhouse, but the industrial department hadn't yet manufactured glass—delayed for now. Fortunately, Hainan was subtropical; even during the Little Ice Age, accumulated temperature was sufficient.

"The land assigned as our test field—" Ye Yuming pointed to boundary stakes—"extends from here to the water mill by the river."

From here to the river was over 100 meters; length about 200 meters—an irregular long rectangle, roughly 20-plus modern *mu*. Adequate for vegetable plots and test fields. A small portion was already leveled, planted with cabbage, greens, peppers, tomatoes—some already harvestable. Cafeteria tables could become slightly more abundant.

But most land remained more stones than soil, still had tree stumps—needed leveling, probably soil brought in. He observed riverbank height and high-water lines, estimating irrigation channels needed, whether to build flood dikes. Where to plant fruit trees, dig fish ponds, where to temporarily house tropical seedlings—all required consideration.

The farm compound's space shouldn't be wasted either—courtyard economy. Build a grape trellis over courtyard paths: half a *mu* of trellis could yield 1000 *jin* of grapes without taking space, providing shade. Plant some fruit trees behind buildings...

He calculated happily. But with labor shortage, he'd need to ask Wu De for some local farmers to help—ideally hired as long-term workers. As for local agriculture conditions, best to find a landlord to ask—but he'd heard landlords and rich peasants had all been released. Too bad—such people had rich farming experience and understood rural social conditions better. But he couldn't speak Lingao dialect—needed interpreters. Troublesome. Better to learn himself. At minimum, for future wife-taking and concubine-acquisition, he'd need emotional communication. Start from "Ah, Oh, E"? But all that for tomorrow—after walking hours, he was exhausted.

That day, he slept in the Agriculture Committee office. After so many days, finally a roof overhead—sleeping indoors felt incredibly happy. Apparently, happiness really did come through comparison.
