# Chapter 571 - The Daoist Arrives

Subsequently, Xi Yazhou announced the implementation of "Decimation"—collective punishment for the labor teams that had participated in the riot. No one except the Elders knew what this meant, but soon the term struck terror into hearts. The three labor squadrons that had participated in the riot were all driven to the center and formed into ranks. Then counting from one to ten, every tenth person was pulled out and hanged.

To the sound of military drums and the battalion's military law officer impassively counting "One, two, three, four...," one person after another was dragged from the ranks and hauled to the gallows to be fitted with a noose. Some of those dragged out to be hanged were stupefied; some struggled desperately; some glared with blood-red eyes wanting to shout, only to have a soldier's rope already around their neck, silencing them. The military drums beat neither fast nor slow, only becoming a rapid rain of beats the instant someone's neck was fitted with a noose about to be raised. And when his life faded, the drums would suddenly pound a few heavy beats, then fall silent for a moment before resuming their unhurried rhythm. The watching laborers were scared out of their wits; some simply collapsed on the spot.

When the drums finally stopped, twenty-seven more had been hanged. It was then announced that the bodies on the gallows were not to be cut down but left to rot, to be pecked by birds and gnawed by insects until they became bare bones to be cast into the sea.

Those laborers not executed were all formed into a "Punishment Squad," assigned exclusively to the most grueling, exhausting, and dangerous work. Their ultimate fate would be determined by the Political Security General Administration.

For the native staff who had died in the disturbance, the Sanya Military Committee lavished praise. Their ashes were solemnly collected and interred, and telegrams were sent to Lingao requesting survivor benefits.

Killing could only temporarily control the situation. To ensure productivity, antimalarial drugs had to be distributed for prevention to the recovered and still-healthy workers. Hippo personally returned to Lingao and presented the Health Department with a request for more compound antimalarial tablets. Shi Nioren didn't dare make this decision on his own—antimalarial drugs were controlled substances. Finally, Planning Council Director Wu De agreed that the Health Department could use stockpiled medications as needed.

"Even if we exhaust all our drug reserves, we must first stabilize Sanya," Wu De said. "If Sanya fails, the coal-iron complex can't be built—then what's the point of talking about developing Taiwan and Southeast Asia?"

"Also nutrition," Hippo said. "The laborers' diet is still too poor—too many carbohydrates, not enough protein. They can't handle heavy manual labor, and it affects their resistance."

Without good nutrition among the laborers, this kind of mass die-off was inevitable.

"I'll allocate you five tons of dried fish and a thousand jars of fish sauce," Wu De said. "Oh, and do you want sugar? It's the best way to replenish energy."

"Certainly," Hippo was quite satisfied. "I'll take brown sugar."

"Nobody's sitting month here—why brown sugar? We have white sugar and rock sugar."

"Ha ha, you believe in that traditional Chinese medicine nonsense too," Hippo expressed disdain. "Brown sugar is just crude sugar with a few more nutrients. What does it have to do with postpartum recovery? Keep the white sugar and such for selling."

"Fine, five tons for you as well."

"Thank you very much." Hippo thanked him and returned to the Health Department to request more medical personnel.

"Nurses are really difficult," sighed Zhang Ziyi, director of the Nursing Division and chief nursing officer, frowning. "You've already been given twenty nurses. If you want more, I can only give you some third-term students—and not too many, just a few."

Her reluctance to release personnel had reasons: the Health Department was currently strengthening medical capabilities everywhere, particularly the number of junior medical practitioners. The "barefoot doctors" hastily trained from among the Elders showed far less learning enthusiasm and effectiveness than the nursing classes; most had slipped away and dropped out by the time they reached the stage of memorizing medical texts and terminology. Disappointed, Director Shi decided to focus training efforts on native nurses. After screening, about half of the first-term nursing class would transfer to medical practitioner training. The remainder would undergo advanced nursing training.

Adding to the nursing shortage was a recent report from Ai Beibei. The report noted: with life secretaries about to arrive in large numbers, a pregnancy and childbirth boom would certainly follow. She recommended starting now to train obstetrics medical practitioners, midwives, and pediatric medical personnel.

Such matters concerning Elder offspring were not to be treated lightly. Director Shi immediately approved, so even the promising students from the second term had to begin new training.

As a result, the remaining second-term students became the backbone. Third-term students had just completed basic training and weren't very capable; fourth-term students even less so.

"Third-term students are fine," Hippo explained the situation in Sanya. "There are many sick people, and nursing staff is insufficient. Besides, you don't have to formally assign them to Sanya Clinic—you could call it an internship."

"That's not the same thing," Zhang Ziyi was unconvinced. "How about I give you a batch of fourth-term students to take along for internship?"

"I don't know nursing specialty." Hippo shook his head repeatedly.

"You have several first and second-term nurses there. The old can mentor the new."

As for doctors, not a single one could be spared—not even Zhang Ziyi's husband, veterinarian Yang Baogui. Hippo was about to take his leave in disappointment when Zhang Ziyi stopped him:

"There's someone, rather strange. But he is a genuine doctor from the Chinese medicine department..."

"Who?" Hippo thought this person was obviously not Liu San.

"The Religious Affairs Office just transferred his personnel file. They want us to arrange something—oh, and he explicitly stated he's willing to serve in the harshest locations. Just right for you." Zhang Ziyi said. "Talk to He Ping for the specifics."

He Ping was the Health Department's office director, specifically handling various miscellaneous matters for the department and its subordinate units. Occasionally he'd go to the pharmaceutical factory as a guest equipment maintenance engineer—he didn't mind the latter since the factory director was his wife, Zhao Yanmei.

He Ping usually kept a low profile—not particularly capable but absolutely obedient to leadership, and he never gossiped outside. He had good personal relationships.

"This person was transferred from the Religious Affairs Office." He Ping pulled out the file. "Named Zhang Yingchen. Looking at his resume, he's genuinely trained as a doctor at a Chinese medicine hospital."

"How come I never knew about such a talent?" Hippo was surprised: doctors—especially those trained in modern medicine—were the scarcest talent in the transmigrator collective.

"After landing, he's been hanging around the Religious Affairs Office doing religious research. Not very interested in his professional work. Unknown how skilled he is, but he definitely has a medical practitioner's license." He Ping said. "This is what Director He of Religious Affairs said."

"Damn, he's not some Christian missionary, is he?" Hippo had no interest in foreign religion. "But fine—right about now we could use some spiritual opium."

"He doesn't seem like a missionary," He Ping didn't know how to describe him. "Kind of mystical, talking about *qi* and the Dao all day..."

"He's not some qigong master, is he?" Hippo became wary. He handed He Ping the list in his hand—a requisition for supplementary drugs, consumables, and equipment. It had already been signed by the Planning Council and Shi Nioren.

"The rest is manageable, but we don't have this much refined salt. Iodine tincture is also short of your requirement." He Ping shook his head.

Hippo found this hard to believe. Refined salt and iodine tincture were the most common consumables in the Health Department—disinfectants that required no paperwork to use.

"We're short on these too?"

"There was an incident at the Ma Niao salt works," He Ping said. "Before Director Wang was transferred, he set them up with a steam salt works with four steam boilers. A few days ago, for some reason, they exploded one after another. The chemical and food factories have high salt demand right now, so suddenly there's a shortage."

"And iodine tincture?"

"Well," He Ping coughed awkwardly, "you know our iodine mainly comes from extracting kelp and other seaweed. But recently eating seaweed has become trendy—the seaweed supply can't keep up."

This fad had started suddenly just a few days ago: word spread that eating kelp and seaweed promoted longevity and made one immune to all poisons. First the rumor swept through natives; the previously worthless dried and fresh kelp in the market was snapped up immediately. Eventually even Elders got caught up in it, though the claims morphed into eating seaweed for whitening skin, sun protection, and enhanced sexual performance. All seaweed dishes in the cafeterias suddenly couldn't meet demand—not only was kelp bean paste soup served three meals a day, but the food factory rushed to produce dried seaweed snacks.

Meanwhile, in the Religious Affairs Office's director's office, He Ying was reviewing a meeting minutes document.

This was from an internal religious affairs symposium held after the new year. He Ying had conducted a social survey of religion in Lingao during the latter half of the previous year, gathering much firsthand material.

At this symposium, the Religious Affairs Office's Zhang Yingchen had presented a paper: "Survey Report on Religious Conditions in Lingao." He then proposed the concept of creating a "New Daoism."

Zhang Yingchen was nearly thirty, formerly a doctor at a Chinese medicine hospital, with special interest in the religious field. He dabbled in Buddhism, Daoism, Christianity, Islam, Judaism—he was something of a semi-professional religious studies researcher. He was particularly interested in Daoist studies and had researched it in considerable depth.

His proposal had sparked fierce debate at the Religious Affairs symposium. Wu Shimang, Bai Duolu and others opposed it. The Lingao Church wasn't eager to see the pie divided. Especially Dean Wu—though he still couldn't even recite the Rosary—had been scheming to launch a comprehensive faith-spreading "crusade" across all of Lingao, uprooting all existing beliefs.

Wu Shimang's opposition wasn't based on faith—he simply didn't want a competitor taking a share. A new religion would first squeeze the Religious Affairs Office's resources, then create difficulties for proselytizing. In his remarks, he enumerated the many complications that competing for believers would cause.

But Zhang Yingchen's proposal won He Ying's support. He had sponsored and presided over the countywide religious survey largely to see what form of religion could better meet the needs of natives in this timeline. He Ying was very clear about the Executive Committee's thinking: introducing Catholicism to Lingao—however enthusiastically the Jesuits embraced it—would essentially just provide a skin for a future new religion. The new body would evolve behind that skin, eventually becoming an entirely new religious form under complete transmigrator control.

Everyone in the Religious Affairs Office clearly understood this ultimate goal, but Dean Wu's recent activities had drawn He Ying's intense attention. Wu Shimang had been tirelessly strengthening the church organization, accumulating church property, vigorously promoting changes in customs, training missionaries... Clearly, Old Wu was preparing to establish a state religion.

He agonized over how to respond. In the short term, Wu Shimang's approach significantly benefited the entire transmigrator collective, but on the other hand, this progress would inevitably create a Roman Curia-style ecclesiastical organization. He Ying was well aware: the Yuan Elder Council wouldn't welcome a powerful church. What they needed was a tool—an absolute tool. Even Director Wen, who cared most about Religious Affairs construction, had repeatedly mentioned in his directives: pay attention to the "degree" of church building.

Zhang Yingchen's idea gave him an insight: monopoly was dangerous; only competition would create a virtuous cycle.

After the meeting, He Ying submitted a report to the Executive Committee, conveying Zhang Yingchen's specific ideas. This involved ideology—not something he could decide unilaterally.

The response was written by Director Wen. The first line was: "Under a single Radiant God domain, any religious form can be discussed."

He Ying was somewhat puzzled—where did "Radiant God" suddenly come from? Was Director Wen planning to create some church himself? Reading further, another line: "The Dao Saints, such as Laozi and Zhuangzi's lineage, are all Great Archangels under the Great Archangel Commander of the Radiant God. The same applies to Christ, son of the Palestinian carpenter."

"I see!" He Ying understood Director Wen's meaning. He summoned Zhang Yingchen for a formal discussion on this matter.

"Director He, you'd better come to my office. I have many things to show you that aren't convenient to bring over," Zhang Yingchen said on the phone.

So He Ying went to his office. Zhang Yingchen's office was in the courtyard. Compared to the scale of the Lingao Church, the Religious Affairs Office was a very small department. Of course, they couldn't conveniently work in the Lingao Seminary—currently they shared a courtyard with the Li-Miao Affairs Office. The latter was almost empty most of the time; the courtyard was very quiet, with lush flowers and trees in the garden beds, very classical in Chinese style. Being in the courtyard, you could hardly sense the bustle outside.

Zhang Yingchen's office was elegantly decorated, full of traditional charm. The furniture, calligraphy, paintings, and ornaments were all purchased with his own money from the cooperative—not the modernist furniture issued by the Planning Committee. 

Zhang Yingchen was sitting in a red sandalwood bamboo-joint chair wearing headphones, writing rapidly. Beside him was a portable CD player. The red sandalwood desk displayed the Four Treasures of the Study, as well as locally made dipping pens with iron nibs. A three-tiered rosewood shelf was lined with books—Ming Dynasty texts he'd personally paid to have the Guangzhou Station purchase. Most were on Daoism.
