# Chapter 1181 - Nintendo

Pleasantries concluded, the two men chatted casually. Master Zhou asked about Australian affairs—though he had long resided abroad, he still had quite a few old acquaintances in both Nanjing and Beijing. And as a maritime merchant, though he'd been too old and frail to go to sea personally these past ten years, his information sources remained well-connected. He wanted to first get a sense of this Australian merchant's background.

Ping Qiusheng understood Master Zhou's thinking. He repeated the backstory he had fabricated earlier, then explained that although his ancestors were Japanese, he was now a subject of Australian Song. This trip to Japan served three purposes: first, to return to his ancestral homeland and fulfill his forebears' wish; second, to apologize for their intrusions at Jeju Island; and third—since Australia was a nation built on industry and commerce with many rare goods—he had hoped to do some business with Japan but, having been away so long, now lacked any connections. He then offered some polite pleasantries.

Master Zhou stroked his beard and nodded repeatedly, not rushing to speak. In his view, this so-called Taira descendant Australian merchant was obviously fabricating—just using the Taira name as cover. But no matter—claiming distinguished ancestors was human nature, especially if one wanted to do business in Japan.

But this Master Ping's meaning was perfectly clear: they wanted to trade with Japan. The Australians' strength—though he had never personally witnessed it during his long residence in Japan—had already spread to Japan along with their goods over these past few years. Chinese ships coming to Nagasaki and vermillion-seal ships returning from the Great Ming occasionally brought scraps of Australian goods, all highly valued and snapped up almost as soon as they arrived in port.

Now that this Australian merchant had come to him seeking cooperation, his heart was both overjoyed and somewhat worried. After all, these Australian merchants were a juggernaut no less formidable than Zheng Zhilong. Whether partnering with them would let him ride their coattails to the heavens or get crushed to powder was hard to say.

Ping Qiusheng presented Master Zhou with ten jars of Lingao-made pickles and two bottles of Peerless Champion. Zhou Xingru was from South Zhili, so seeing these pickles naturally felt especially familiar. And the Peerless Champion made him marvel inwardly: he had never seen such clear glass bottles. Glass bottles broke easily, and this liquor was in such short supply in Guangzhou that people often had it sent from the capital by special courier. No bulk quantities had ever arrived in Japan.

He couldn't help but silently admire the Australians' cleverness. Since the topic had turned to business, the atmosphere gradually relaxed. Knowing that Australians were most skilled at having hot-selling rare goods—items rarely seen elsewhere—now that he'd seen this Peerless Champion, he understood why it was so popular.

"This old man is unworthy, but I still have some connections throughout these Eastern isles. May I ask what goods your side deals in, and what quantities you require?"

Ping Qiusheng saw an opening and immediately ordered an attendant to bring out an exquisite paper box containing a thick tome—as thick as a photo album from a portrait studio.

This leather-bound volume was a product catalog. The binding and illustrations were entirely Leibtrani's work. All the designs used copperplate engravings; the paper was heavy stock; the decoration and printing were as exquisite as could be. By this timeline's standards, this catalog was practically a treasure in itself.

These hardcover albums were promotional brochures and order forms to be distributed to potential trade partners. To prevent anyone from discarding them, they had been made so elaborately luxurious.

Like the catalogs in Lingao's department stores, the first half of these manuals categorized and described in detail the appearance, performance, quality, and FOB prices of all products the Senate could provide—all the data necessary for trade. Some products even included line-drawn sketches—photo paper reserves were insufficient for such mass consumption, and until photography technology and equipment could be restored, they had to make do with this ancient but effective method. In actual effect, this Italian artist's work seemed to produce better results than the printing factory's crude photo printing.

The catalog's appendix listed information about goods the foreign trade company wanted to purchase. Each catalog's contents were adjusted based on the region and recipient—some adjusted product content, others adjusted pricing. To facilitate reading by natives, the catalogs were printed in multiple languages. The one given to Zhou Xingru was printed in traditional vertical Chinese characters. Anyone who received one of these catalogs and wished to trade with Lingao could easily understand from this manual how to conduct transactions.

Zhou Xingru leafed through the thick volume, clicking his tongue in amazement. He had dealt with many merchants, but this was the first time someone didn't bring actual gold-and-silver samples for him to inspect personally, instead showing him a catalog. The catalog's exquisiteness, the meticulousness and realism of the illustrations, and the detail of the descriptions opened his eyes.

Especially the product descriptions, which included every detail down to dimensions, colors, materials, and weights. There were even explanations of what packaging methods were available.

The variety of goods was immense. Zhou Xingru flipped through roughly and saw the sales catalog divided into five categories: food, daily goods, weapons, textiles, and farm tools. Each category was further subdivided into many items—a dazzling array that left Master Zhou struggling to keep up.

He leafed through it, unable to put it down, finally setting it down reluctantly: "Your group is truly extraordinary!"

"Not at all, Master Zhou is too kind." Ping Qiusheng could tell from his expression that the deal was more than halfway done. He immediately clapped his hands, and a servant brought in another reinforced box.

The box contained, as usual, some novel Lingao products: glass mirrors, bone china, and such, which amazed Master Zhou. The merchant's mind immediately began churning.

This Master Ping's every move thoroughly demonstrated his genuine sincerity. This was very attractive to Master Zhou, whose business was in decline. He didn't have many ships, and his capital couldn't match big maritime merchants like Zheng Zhilong. If he could become a local import merchant, that would be a comfortable business of just counting money.

"I wonder how Master Ping plans to sell goods here?" Though Master Zhou's heart was surging, years of experience let him maintain a calm and friendly smile. After all, on this Fukue Island, he was the host and the Australians were guests—there was much to be done in between.

"I'll need to trouble Master Zhou greatly to help make this happen," Ping Qiusheng said with great sincerity.

"Easily done, easily done," Master Zhou said with the air of a generous elder.

And so both men secretly smirked in their hearts.

The two sides then discussed entering into "deep, close cooperation." They agreed to establish a joint trading post on Fukue Island, with the Zhou family handling the formalities. Capital investment and personnel would be the Australians' responsibility; the Zhou family would handle purchasing local land, managing relations with domain officials, and smoothing connections all the way to Edo.

The new trading post would be named "Nintendo." Ping Qiusheng was quite satisfied with this name. Elder Qiao, being a Nintendo fan, lodged a not-very-determined protest, but was easily overruled.

The trading post's total capital was 100,000 taels of silver. The Zhou family held forty percent, invested in cash; the Senate held sixty percent, invested in cash and goods. Ping Qiusheng followed the precedent of the Guangdong Zi Enterprises, distributing dividends according to twenty-three shares: three shares for employee welfare retention and bonuses, the remaining twenty shares of profits to be divided with the Zhou family according to capital contribution.

The trading post's current labor needs would temporarily be sourced locally with the Zhou family's help—though Jeju Island had plenty of people, doing business on Japanese soil required at least some Japanese language ability. Ping Qiusheng specifically requested that local Chinese be preferred. Zhou Xingru said that recently the domain lord was constructing a castle at Ishida, so most locals had been conscripted for the construction site—finding Japanese laborers wasn't easy. In the end, they recruited two young servants, both around fifteen years old. According to Master Zhou, both were illegitimate sons of Great Ming sailors and merchants; their mothers were Japanese. Ships from the Great Ming had long frequented this place, so naturally there were plenty of offspring left behind by Ming men's passing dalliances.

These two servants were called Chinese, but actually spoke Japanese more fluently than Chinese. Ping Qiusheng wasn't entirely satisfied, but when he heard they could both read and write Chinese characters, he decided they were moldable material and kept them. Master Zhou also found them several local Japanese women to serve as maids, specifically to handle daily shopping and housework. After all, this wasn't the Great Ming—unmarried women doing some work in public wasn't considered improper. And locals were more familiar with the area.

When Qiao Tianzhi heard there would be Japanese maids, he immediately said he wanted to personally screen and select them. Of course, he ended up disappointed and gave up—this height, this skin, these teeth... they nearly broke the ceiling. He then very zombie-like told Ping Qiusheng to ask Master Zhou to get him some local lolis to implement a "Hikaru Genji plan."

"That would be easy enough, but there's no way to expense it," Ping Qiusheng said. Though he wasn't a fellow traveler, he very much agreed with the point about "cultivating maids from a young age"—the island was full of fishing family girls running around barefoot in torn kimonos with disheveled hair, but buying a few to train lacked a suitable justification. Ever since Old Chang's incident, everyone had become more cautious about such abuse of public resources for private purposes.

So the matter was temporarily shelved. Master Zhou bought several abandoned samurai residences near the port. These buildings were all fine timber-frame construction, spacious, and almost all equipped with fireproof earthen storehouses. They could barely serve as temporary quarters and warehouses.

Fukue Island's port had excellent natural conditions. During Wang Zhi's heyday controlling China's coast, it had been a major base for Chinese pirates and maritime merchants. Thanks to the frequent visits of Great Ming merchants, the port facilities here were complete, with wooden piers where H800s could directly dock to unload cargo.

Once things were settled here, the first shipment of goods constituting capital also arrived from Jeju Island, including large quantities of salt, sugar and candy, mirrors, glassware, bone china, Chinese medicinal materials, and cloth. Also arriving with the ship were a dozen or so naturalized citizens—these would become the backbone personnel of the Japan Station.

Once the personnel were assembled, Ping Qiusheng appointed Qiao Tianzhi as temporary general manager of Nintendo, responsible for renovating the newly purchased residences and incidentally repairing the pier. Once the goods arrived, business would officially open.
