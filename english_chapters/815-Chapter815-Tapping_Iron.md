# Chapter 815 - Tapping Iron

Foreman Li immediately led several workers carrying prepared refractory mud up to quickly seal the slag notch. Ji Wusheng gave a sharp tug on the steam whistle—the piercing sound warned workers around the blast furnace that material was about to be discharged from the hearth, and everyone needed to stay clear for safety.

Several workers began to agitate the furnace bottom with iron rods. As they worked together, sparks shot out from the taphole like fireworks, dancing in the air. This was the charcoal ash from the furnace bottom being blown out.

Ji Wusheng directed the workers to keep agitating, ensuring the ash was continuously expelled. Removing the ash prevented it from mixing with the slag and causing a "bottom buildup."

Once no more ash was being blown out, he instructed the workers to seal the taphole. Then, full blast was applied. The blowers emitted a howling whine, and the temperature in the workshop climbed higher and higher. Ji Wusheng felt sweat sliding down his forehead continuously—his thick work uniform trapped the heat, but he remained motionless before the furnace, observing. Occasionally, he checked his watch, timing the process.

"All right!" Ji Wusheng decided the conditions were about right and instructed Foreman Li, "From now on, keep a close eye on the stockline position. When the coke layer drops to the specified level, start adding blank coke gradually. Add some slag-forming materials too—I've taught you how much to add each time. If you forget, check the process manual!"

"I haven't forgotten!" Foreman Li recited a string of data fluently.

"Good. From now until the morning shift takes over tomorrow, don't add ore. Wait until I get here to start adding ore. Keep adding coke continuously! Maintain the furnace temperature!"

The second drying period would take about 24 hours. Only when the entire blast furnace reached sufficient temperature could they start adding small batches of iron ore. All this was to ensure furnace temperature—maintaining heat was a crucial topic in blast-furnace smelting. Insufficient heat not only affected iron yield but could also cause numerous malfunctions, ultimately requiring a shutdown for major repairs.

Ji Wusheng went back and snatched some sleep. When he woke, it was exactly evening, and the middle shift had taken over. He checked the handover logs, then used a steel rod inserted through the spyhole to check the coke combustion and wall temperature.

"Continue adding small batches of coke and keep the blast on." Ji Wusheng felt the heat was still slightly lacking and decided to wait until the morning of the 7th to start adding ore.

At noon on February 7, following Ji Wusheng's order, the first batch of refined iron ore powder and slagging materials was finally charged into the blast furnace, marking the start of formal pig-iron smelting. Ji Wusheng was even more nervous than the workers—they were just following technical documents and his instructions precisely, but no one knew if this oversized knockoff built from knockoff parts could withstand the test of normal operation. Ji Wusheng knew the blast furnace's success or failure would determine how fast they could climb the tech tree.

On February 8, the blast furnace finally tapped its first heat of molten iron. The main runner was built of sand and stone, filled with yellow sand. The casting bed used pig-iron molds. After the first batch of pig-iron ingots was produced, Ji Wusheng ordered someone to take an iron brick by car to the chemical lab at Bopu for composition analysis.

The analysis results were quickly fed back to the steelworks via telegraph. The pig iron quality was excellent; the levels of phosphorus and sulfur—which affected quality—were extremely low, far superior to the various scrap and pig irons they had acquired from the mainland. The combination of high-quality iron ore and the "divine artifact" of modern blast-furnace smelting created such premium pig iron.

Ji Wusheng's face beamed: "Fantastic! With premium pig iron, making good steel will be much easier."

After tapping the iron, they began the first slag tapping. The slag was discharged into a large water pool filled with river water sent from the water plant after simple sedimentation. The cooled slag was raw material for cement. As for the cooling water heated by the slag, it was piped away to utilize the waste heat.

"From now on, tap iron every two hours! Tap slag every 15 minutes!" Ji Wusheng commanded. He collected a sample of the first cooled slag and handed it to a clerk to rush to Bopu for composition analysis, so they could adjust the slagging ingredients at any time.

"Without a lab here, people are going to run their legs off." Watching the high-spirited clerk trot out with the sample jar, Ji Wusheng sighed. Ma'ao's only land link was a road; walking or cycling was too slow. To speed up item transport, the Planning Commission had allocated a motorcycle to the Ma'ao Industrial Zone. Urgent deliveries were handled by motorcycle courier.

Soon the slag composition analysis came back, telegraphed to the steelworks. The composition was roughly within Ji Wusheng's predicted range—the feed formula and figures had been precisely calculated by him, a summary of over a hundred years of modern blast-furnace experience. Now Ji Wusheng had sufficient confidence that the blast furnace could produce iron stably over the long term. But he still dared not relax, staying in the workshop 24 hours a day, napping in the office when tired, then getting up to check the furnace condition again—he dared not slack off with the naturalized workers under him. After all, the longest-serving of these men had been a real industrial worker for only a year and a half. Bad habits and mindsets still dominated their thinking. There were many new workers and few veterans; if he didn't watch closely, accidents were more likely.

Under his day-and-night surveillance, the blast furnace was running completely normally after 48 hours. Based on the iron ore and coke input figures, Ji Wusheng calculated the furnace conversion rate to be about 0.79—not high; modern blast furnaces could generally reach a level of 1. But he wasn't worried; as long as they continued improving the feed ratio and slagging process, he was confident of reaching about 0.90. Even at the 0.79 level, daily pig-iron output far exceeded 50 tons. The furnace's capacity was much higher than estimated.

To celebrate the official start of production at No. 1 Blast Furnace, the Council of Elders ordered extra rations for the students at Fangshaodi, including their favorite fruit candies. Many years later, the "Children of Fangshaodi," who had grown into the backbone of the empire, would often recall the wonderful days of receiving "special rations." Whenever extra rations were distributed, students would stand in classrooms, dorms, and playgrounds cheering "Long Live!"—everyone knew this was a new step forward for the empire under the correct, glorious, and great leadership of the Council of Elders.

Meanwhile, on February 9, the *Lingao Times* published a red-letter headline news story in both its internal and external editions. Needless to say, the naturalized citizens knew, and even the locals who dealt frequently with the Elders knew, that a big red headline meant the Elders had accomplished something major—usually happy news. The members of the County Consultative Council couldn't really understand the articles full of "Newspeak," but the council had a dedicated "Female Aussie" liaison officer who explained the newspapers and documents at every meeting. When Tang Tang explained that this meant a big stove that could produce over a hundred thousand *jin* of iron, although they didn't know the specific implications, they understood from the Elders' solemnity that this matter was extraordinary. They continuously wrote a "congratulatory letter" in the name of the County Consultative Council, wrote it on big red paper, and delivered it to East Gate Market with gongs and drums. Zhang Youfu also instructed his subordinates to buy firecrackers and set them off crackling and popping at the council entrance.

Wu De closed the window—the firecrackers outside were particularly noisy, interfering with the Executive Committee's standing working meeting.

This standing meeting had been convened at his request; the topic was solving the power-coal supply problem. Of course, the so-called power-coal problem was actually the Hongji problem.

"...All right, the coal supply situation is laid out here," Wu De said. "I assume everyone understands the current status. Coal channels haven't increased, but users have increased quite a lot. If we don't solve the coal problem once and for all, I'm afraid maintaining the industrial system's operation will be an issue."

As if to verify his statement, the warning whistle of a boiler venting steam sounded outside—reminding the Elders present how many boilers in all of Lingao were burning, driving how many steam engines tirelessly providing endless power for Lingao's industrialization. And in Sanya, Hong Kong, and Leizhou, there were many more boilers waiting for high-quality coal to fill their enormous appetites.

"Expecting Guo Yi to restore the coal transport route immediately isn't realistic—besides, the Pearl River Delta isn't close to Lingao. At best, he can solve Hong Kong's power-coal problem right now. The Zhanjiang coal from Leizhou is currently our main power coal; that's the most stable supply at the moment."

He didn't include Qiongshan's Jiazi Coal Mine or Lingao's Nanbao Coal Mine in the power-coal statistics. The former was reserved for the Chemical and Metallurgical ministries for coking; the latter had such low calorific value it could only serve as fertilizer.

"Is the Danzhou coal mine worth developing? I recall there are oil sands there too?"

"Yes, Danzhou has the Changpo Coal Mine, considered one of the larger mines on Hainan," said Bai Guoshi, attending on behalf of the exploration department. "But it's deep and requires significant upfront investment. The coal quality isn't ideal either—Changpo is actually in the same mineral belt as the Nanbao mine."

As for the Danzhou oil sands, the burial depth was great, making extraction difficult. Furthermore, extraction would require accompanying refining equipment; right now demand for fuel oil wasn't high, so the investment wasn't worth the return.

"Ah De, we understand what you mean!" Ma Qianzhu said. "You want us to directly intervene in developing Hongji, rather than relying on sporadic purchases through the Vietnam Trade Company as we do now."

Wu De nodded: "Yes, that's exactly what I mean. The time has come where we must directly intervene in Hongji."
