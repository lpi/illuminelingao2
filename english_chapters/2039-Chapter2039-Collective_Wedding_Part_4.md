# Chapter 2039 - Collective Wedding (Part 4)

Song Yingsheng suddenly understood why the Australians were so keen on "painting slogans," "singing songs," and "holding assemblies"—they called it "propaganda," and propaganda was showing the good deeds they did to the common people, making the people feel they were good, the so-called "winning hearts and minds."

Thinking in reverse, what was spending this bit of money on today's grand display to them? Not to mention most of the money wasn't even theirs, even if it were, spending tens of thousands of taels of silver to buy the hearts and word of mouth of the people—that was something no amount of silver could exchange for.

Song Yingsheng sighed secretly. He suddenly realized that for many years, the court and the public always pinned their hopes on using moral essays to "enlighten" the people, but forgot that the Master had long said: "The mean man understands profit." And the people—were truly suffering too much...

He looked at the river surface of the White Swan Pool; it was so lively and joyous here. Even compared to his hometown which could still be called "peaceful," this was no less than a paradise on earth. No wonder the Australians had landed in Qiongzhou less than ten years ago, yet could win the hearts of the people wherever they went, earning this corner of the southern frontier with a starting force of merely hundreds, eyeing the Central Plains like a tiger. They truly had the boldness to contend with the Great Ming.

In his silence, one side of the *Octopus*'s paddle wheels began to slow down, while the other side began to accelerate. The paddles struck the river surface, churning up turbulent waves, and the *Octopus* began to turn slowly, heading southeast.

With the *Octopus*'s turn, the Flower-tailed Barge behind it also clumsily turned its hull—sailors shouted and yelled, holding boat poles in tension, waiting for orders: this kind of boat had a high center of gravity and a clumsy hull, extremely prone to capsizing. Great care had to be taken when turning.

The fleet following around also turned around. After circling the White Swan Pool once, the entire fleet sailed toward the Great World Wharf.

The Great World Wharf was already decorated anew. Flower beds and colorful towers were present in full. On the Great World Plaza, a large red carpet was laid. On this carpet aisle, twelve arches were built, all decorated with fresh flowers and vines. The arches were connected by iron wires, hung full of flower baskets, flower balls, colorful lanterns, and other decorations. It was full of the creativity and aesthetic taste of a 21st-century wedding company.

On the plaza, a stage was built using the steps as a foundation, with the main building of the Great World Department Store as the background. At this time, a group of "VIPs" were sitting upright on it, awaiting the arrival of the newcomers.

To maintain order, except for wedding guests and some naturalized citizens and indigenous representatives selected to "observe the ceremony" who could enter the plaza, onlookers were intercepted outside the colonnades on both sides of the plaza. Hundreds of National Army soldiers holding rifles with fixed bayonets formed a cordon; although voices were seething, it was orderly.

The onlookers were all eager to see what this "Australian-style collective marriage" looked like, so people had come to occupy spots since dawn. By now, it was a sea of people. Actually, those squeezed in the back couldn't see anything at all, only feeling the noisy atmosphere of the scene.

Wen Desi was currently sitting upright on the folding chair in the center, wearing a white US Navy uniform decorated with gold braiding but without insignia. Although some felt his wearing a white military dress uniform at a wedding meant "shocking the world and appalling customs," they were finally silenced by the four words "Changing Customs and Habits."

"In my view, the bride should wear a pure white wedding dress, and the groom a black military service uniform—that creates an imposing manner!" Wen Desi said. "Only in this way can we highlight our boldness in establishing a new society, new culture, and new customs..."

Of course, his proposal was not passed in the end. Although customs were to be changed, changing too much at once would be too "shocking to the countrymen" indeed. However, regarding his wearing the white naval dress uniform, no one nagged him about it.

Besides Wen Desi, there were several other Elders sitting upright in the reception hall preparing to receive the ceremony. Liu Xiang naturally wouldn't miss this great opportunity to be "close to the people," only with Wen Desi present, he could only settle for the second seat. Wang Jun and Du Yibin were the initiators and handlers of this event, so naturally, two seats had to be left next to Wen Desi. These gentlemen were all in stiff "Cadre Suits." Sitting in the last seat was Cui Hantang—as the main fundraiser for the wedding, naturally, he couldn't be forgotten either. Although Australian-style marriage was the "first time since creation," his Daoist robe was indeed eye-catching. For a time, he and Wen Desi became the focal points of heated discussion among the onlookers.

Because it was a wedding, having only men would be too serious and also unfavorable for raising women's status, so Zhang Yunmi was specially invited to the rostrum as an embellishment. Zhang Yunmi was young and specially wore a red dress custom-made for this occasion, provoking widespread discussion among the onlookers below. Many were politically incorrect remarks like "a fresh flower stuck in a pile of cow dung" or "the Australian little lady's waist is so thin."

Since taking this seat, Wen Desi couldn't help yawning—this was too boring. Yet he really couldn't work up the interest to chat with the Elders beside him. Because everyone wanted to "report work" to him, hoping to transfer a pile of problems upwards or see if they could ask him to help advocate in the "Central Committee." As for Cui Hantang, every time he met him, he would talk about "the harm of monotheism," "Daoism is the orthodox native religion of China," and "New Daoism can and completely should become the pillar of the Council of Elders' state founding." Wen Desi was annoyed to death, so this time he specially arranged him in the position furthest from himself.

"This damn place, can't even scroll through a phone!" Wen Desi cursed secretly.

Just as he was bored, deafening firecracker sounds suddenly rang out from the direction of the wharf. The people on the rostrum who were already drowsy instantly regained their spirit—finally started!

There was a distance of several hundred meters from the wharf to the main gate of the Great World. This distance of several hundred meters had not only been specially leveled and cleaned but also paved with red carpet.

Underfoot was red carpet, on both sides were heavily armed soldiers and police on guard, "Ground Full of Spring" firecrackers crackled endlessly, and drums and music roared in ears. Accompanying staff threw candies into the crowd from time to time, setting off waves in the crowd.

The grooms and brides were flushed at this moment, entranced. Seeming completely unaware of where they were, they followed people forward dizzily. This big red carpet was soft, just stepping on it like this. They were wearing brand new clothes—living for so long, they had never been so glorious and happy. Recalling the past, it seemed as if they were now reincarnated and became humans again. If their parents were still alive and could see their daughter getting married so gloriously, how good that would be.

Far ahead, they saw the Bell Tower. They had heard others say this was the Bell Tower built by the Council of Elders. Big and imposing, every time it chimed the hour, half of Guangzhou city could hear it. The main gate under the Bell Tower was never opened; it was said it would only open to welcome when big shots arrived. At this moment, the main gate was wide open, and the red carpet paved the way through. Wearing a red skirt, walking through the main gate—things they didn't dare think of when leaning on doors selling smiles in the past—being able to leave the profession was already extremely lucky, how could they dare hope for these. Firecrackers rang continuously, people seemed to float up, the sun was so bright...

"Captain He! Someone fainted!" A commotion suddenly erupted in the queue. He Xiaoyue followed the crowd and hurried a few steps over, seeing a bride in the team limp on the ground, the groom beside her looking helpless. The queue nearby also became disordered, with many people watching.

"Don't look! Hurry and follow the team! Don't miss the auspicious time." While dispersing the crowd, He Xiaoyue touched her nose and chest, feeling nothing serious. Just as she was about to take out a bottle of Marching Powder from her satchel, the bride opened her eyes.

"I... where am... I?" The bride widened her eyes and asked somewhat confusedly.

"Where else could you be, today is your big joyful day! Get up quickly!" Seeing the queue of newcomers was almost passing, He Xiaoyue hurriedly helped her up, and incidentally rolled her eyes at the clumsy groom: "No eyesight at all! This is your wife, give a hand quickly!"

The groom hurried over to help support. He Xiaoyue asked: "How is your body? Can you still walk?"

"It doesn't matter." The bride stared at her with wide eyes, "You are... Captain... He?"

"It's me." Now it was He Xiaoyue's turn to be confused. Was this mental derangement? She hurriedly said, "Today is your big joyful day, get up quickly and keep up with the team!"

This remark didn't matter, but the bride actually covered her face and started crying. He Xiaoyue was frantic—crying at a wedding was extremely inauspicious. However, no matter how she comforted and persuaded, the bride cried more and more fiercely, and the groom was also helpless. It made her quite wretched. It was the policeman beside them who had experience, saying: "This bride is overjoyed, a mouthful of phlegm blocked it and couldn't come up. Give her some Marching Powder."

Hearing the reminder, He Xiaoyue hurriedly took out the Marching Powder, sprayed some into her nose, and comforted her with kind words. It took a good while to soothe this bride. Only with this tossing about, her hair and makeup on her face were ruined. He Xiaoyue had a comb and powder in her satchel, so she had to temporarily take this couple to the rest tent by the roadside to groom and retouch makeup.

The rostrum naturally didn't see this small interlude. Everyone was looking forward with anticipation when Du Yibin rushed over hurriedly—he had run all the way after getting off the boat, just to reach the rostrum before the brides and grooms entered. Wang Jun hurriedly made room for him, saying: "Told you not to go on the flower boat cruise, rushing so urgently!"

"No... no... no choice..." Du Yibin gasped for breath, "I'm always unreconciled if I don't educate Song Yingsheng well."

"Educated well?" Wang Jun knew he had spent countless efforts on this old man, actually holding no hope for a long time.

"Hehe, there's great progress today!" Du Yibin beamed with joy, like a otaku who finally got the WeChat ID of a goddess, "This old man's tone has loosened; looks like he was greatly touched by today's wedding. In addition, I have an unexpected harvest."
