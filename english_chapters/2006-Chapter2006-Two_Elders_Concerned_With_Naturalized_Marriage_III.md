# Chapter 2006 - Two Elders Concerned With Naturalized Marriage (III)

"Mm-hmm, and then? Where will the women come from?"

"You see, that phrasing is very incorrect. At the first reading in the Council of Elders, the female Elders would tear it to shreds," Wang Jun said. "Don't be so blunt, and don't mention gender issues. 'Wives for naturalized workers' should be changed to 'spouses for naturalized workers'—spouse can refer to either gender. That'll sound less grating to female Elders, and this proposal won't only be serving male workers anymore, right?"

Du Yibin thought to himself that he couldn't manage all these verbal gymnastics. In the future, he'd better just go home and raise chickens and pangolins properly.

"As for the source of spouses you mentioned: forget about female prisoners—once it goes to discussion in the Council of Elders, there'll be arguments for months. Qingjie Hall is a reliable source, but the numbers won't be large. As for importing women from overseas—India, Vietnam, whatever you say—that needs Five Oaks' approval. It'll cost money."

"So it seems things are quite difficult to manage..." Du Yibin immediately became dejected. Recent issues of *Qiming Star* all had articles about fiscal problems—the gist being "difficult."

"So we should rely on local resources!" Wang Jun took the opportunity to pitch his own proposal. "Guangzhou has several hundred thousand people—the absolute number of eligible single women can't be small. If we organize several group matchmaking events, wouldn't that work? Forget about little Zhang—even Liu Xiang and the big shots in the Council won't be able to say no. Look, we're promoting marital autonomy, changing social customs, solving workers' livelihood difficulties..."

"But what about the disabled naturalized citizens?" Du Yibin quickly interrupted his elaboration. "Would women at the matchmaking events take a liking to them?"

"Brother! The marriage concept in this era is 'marrying a man means food and clothes.' For most lower and middle-class women, choosing a mate mainly considers the man's economic ability, not his looks. Mutual love and matching beauty with talent—that's something only well-fed young ladies can consider." Wang Jun said. "As long as disabled naturalized citizens have suitable income, women will naturally be willing to marry them. Didn't the Finance department approve special marriage subsidies for disabled naturalized citizens?"

"Alright," Du Yibin was convinced. "But who's willing to come? We can't just drag women off the street for matchmaking."

"So that's why you've been eyeing those female prisoners?"

"Exactly."

"The female prisoner idea was good, just unrealistic. I think you overlooked a more practical, larger resource."

"What?"

"Prostitutes."

"Prostitutes?" Du Yibin never dreamed Wang Jun would propose such a thing. He immediately shook his head dismissively. "That's what's really unrealistic—prostitutes are all lazy and greedy. Their living standards: dressed in gold and silver, eating delicacies, with maids and servants attending them. They all like to dabble in arts and music. Never mind disabled naturalized citizens—even Elders like us might not meet their standards."

"You can't take high-class courtesans like Dong Xiaowan as representative of all prostitutes," Wang Jun laughed. "Most prostitutes are actually living in dire straits. Did you read the recent issue of *Qiming Star*?"

"No, why?"

"There's a report called 'Guangzhou Public Morality Rectification.' It contains very detailed research, particularly noting that although we now permit prostitutes to 'self-operate' after cracking down on the criminal elements in the brothels and cleaning up the business environment, over seventy percent of local prostitutes have expressed hope to leave the profession. Moreover, among those who plan to continue, many are from hereditary entertainer or boat-dwelling families with no other means of livelihood. If given suitable alternatives, they'd be willing to seek other paths. Those who truly want to stay in this line of work are probably less than ten percent."

"Such a high percentage?"

"That's right." Wang Jun nodded. "Looking at the statistics, there are currently over fifteen hundred prostitutes holding yellow tickets in Guangzhou city. Even if seventy percent want to leave the profession, that's at least a thousand people."

"But... I feel like maybe..." Du Yibin said. "Prostitutes—would the naturalized citizens be willing to marry them? This is the seventeenth century!"

"I don't know about this time period, but in the old timeline, when brothels were banned in the fifties and prostitutes were liberated, most of them formed families. In any time period, concepts of chastity only have a market in the upper and middle classes. Ordinary laborers are just grateful to find a wife at all—they're not that picky."

After reaching consensus, the two divided the work. Wang Jun would be responsible for persuading Guangzhou city's relevant leaders to "green-light" the matchmaking activities. Whether matchmaking or weddings, both required venues and materials, necessitating support from local power-holders. Wang Jun wasn't actually an eloquent speaker, but he worked in the industrial department and was responsible for steam engine maintenance—a solid "technical cadre." Local Elders were generally quite courteous to him on the principle that "he might come in useful at a critical moment."

As for Du Yibin, he would be responsible for persuading the women in the shelter to "voluntarily choose" disabled naturalized citizens as spouses.

Speaking of it, solving the marriage problems of "disabled naturalized citizens" wasn't more difficult than when the Civil Affairs department found wives for disabled Korean War veterans back in the day. The Council of Elders' mass medical standards were quite primitive, with severe material shortages. Even now, severely wounded casualties basically couldn't survive. So among the disabled naturalized citizens, very few were incapacitated to the point of "being unable to care for themselves"—most just had missing limbs. Relatively speaking, the difficulty wasn't too great.

The more difficult cases were those with chemical burns. Among disabled naturalized citizens in the industrial sector, this was a large group. Many people with chemical burns had facial scarring and deformities. Some were "about the same as Quasimodo"—in fact, for Du Yibin, who had interacted with many disabled naturalized citizens, the legendary Quasimodo could be considered a handsome man compared to them.

Though the Council of Elders' medical standards were sufficient for cosmetic surgery, limited by inadequate antibiotics and other technical support, few facial reconstructive surgeries had been performed. Du Yibin felt they were the most difficult group to help.

No matter how much people talked about valuing "inner beauty" or "good character" or "drive to succeed," ultimately it all came down to being visual creatures. Du Yibin sighed: "Without organizational arrangements, it won't work..."

Du Yibin arrived at Huanghua Temple—this had formerly been Guangzhou Prefecture's "Puji Hall," now converted to "Guangdong Province Temporary Shelter." Its function remained the same as before: specifically sheltering various "homeless" people.

The place had already been repaired and cleaned. The formerly dilapidated and desolate scene had been swept away. Though the repairs were rather hasty and crude, compared to the pitiful state when Liu San came to inspect, it was worlds apart.

The Director and Deputy Director and their crew were already waiting at the gate to "respectfully await" Du Yibin's arrival. Behind them followed several dozen elderly people, children, and women, all wearing identical dark blue short jackets. Their faces and hands had been scrubbed clean to "welcome the Elder's inspection."

The moment he stepped down from his sedan chair, the Director came forward with a beaming smile: "Greetings, Elder Du! I'm the Director here, named Lu Weijia. You can call me Little Lu."

Du Yibin noticed this "Little Lu" had a face full of stubble and deep wrinkles—nothing "little" about him. He teased: "I think 'Old Lu' is more like it."

"Yes, yes, Old Lu works too," Lu Weijia nodded repeatedly.

Du Yibin noticed he was wearing a washed-out old military uniform with the collar insignia and cap badge removed. He probably knew this was a military veteran—the few veterans under the Council of Elders' rule all liked to dress this way to show their "different origins." He deliberately asked: "What year did you enlist?"

"Reporting, Elder! I enlisted in 1632 in Zhejiang—just the National Army. Later, during security operations in Gaoxiong, I was wounded. My legs became stiff, so I was discharged..."

"So you're a combat-wounded soldier. What grade were you rated?"

"Grade eight. Walking isn't too smooth now."

"Do you have a wife?"

Lu Weijia started, then quickly said: "Yes... I married before I enlisted. She and the children are still in Lingao..."

Du Yibin wasn't actually interested in this. Hearing that he had a wife, he dropped the subject. Seeing a "cadre" with a hunched back standing nearby, smiling ingratiatingly at him and finding it somewhat annoying, he asked:

"Who's this...?"

"This is Deputy Director Mao, a retained local employee."

Deputy Director Mao Xiuyu, who had been waiting on the side for a while, quickly approached: "Your humble servant is Mao Xiuyu, the Deputy Director here. Today the Elder has graced us with an inspection..."

"Alright, alright, enough with the formalities." Du Yibin said impatiently. "Let's go inside to talk."

"Yes, yes. Please."

News of Du Yibin's "inspection" had reached the shelter a day in advance. Director Lu had mobilized staff the previous night to thoroughly clean the entire facility. Not a single fallen leaf was visible on any of the paths.

However, Du Yibin hadn't come here to inspect, so he paid no attention to these careful preparations. Instead, he asked about the current population situation in the shelter.

Lu Weijia explained that since Huanghua Temple's conditions were rather poor—far inferior to the Council of Elders' own "Cihui Hall" with its complete facilities—the residents here mostly fell under "special care." Currently, they mainly housed the disabled, elderly, orphans, and certain special groups. Prostitutes rescued during the public morality rectification campaign were also uniformly housed here, though they were managed separately under their own department: the "Jiliang Institute."

"What about those widows?"

"They're here too. They're placed in the former Qingjie Hall area. Since many came, an additional courtyard was added."

After the various Qingjie Halls were consolidated, the "chaste widows" inside followed the principle of "freedom to come and go." Those who could return to their parents' home or seek refuge with relatives were given travel expenses or escorted home. They were also permitted to choose their own mates and remarry.

Some who'd had sweethearts before marriage had people come to "claim" them to "resume their past relationship." Some of the "first loves" who were summoned were overjoyed, arriving full of gratitude toward the Council of Elders. Others had already married and were unwilling to come, leaving the women with empty hopes. Still others came claiming they'd like to take them home as "concubines." In the chaos, there were also criminals who used the opportunity to abduct women, so this practice was eventually halted.
