# Chapter 1601 - The Pursuit

The youth had been compliant before, but now his expression revealed a hint of defiance. Fearful of the sharp sword in Zhuo Yifan's hand, he could only mutter under his breath: "The government never does anything but demand money and grain..."

Zhuo Yifan caught his breath: "How can you say they do nothing? You people here on this remote frontier of Hainan have enjoyed two hundred years of peace, with food and clothing aplenty—is that not the grace of our Great Ming? As for paying taxes and grain, that is simply your duty. Besides, I heard you say your family were tenant farmers—the taxes aren't even paid by the likes of you..."

"Before the Chiefs arrived, we were always plagued by Li bandits, and the government never did anything about it. And as for the grain taxes paid by the landowners, doesn't that all come from us tenant farmers anyway..." the youth said. "Landlord Zhou used to raise the rent every year for years, claiming it was orders from the court. But ever since the Chiefs came, Landlord Zhou hasn't dared raise the rent—he's even lowered it considerably!"

Zhuo Yifan sighed: "You're not saying the Shorn Bandits forced him to reduce the rent?"

"Well, no," the youth said. "The Chiefs opened up many enterprises in Nanbao—mines, shops, and big factories. My parents have no great skills, they only know farming, so they went to work as laborers at the agricultural station. It's hard work, but at least the whole family has food to eat and clothes to wear. We've even rebuilt our house now. Compared to those half-starving days when we were tenants for Landlord Zhou, who would still want to rent his land?" Here he couldn't help showing a hint of pride. "Landlord Zhou is practically begging people to rent from him now—who cares!"

A world where landlords begged farmers to rent their land! Zhuo Yifan couldn't help being taken aback. He had traveled the jianghu and seen much of the world; he had witnessed many instances of disputes between landlords and tenants erupting into bloodshed. Unless there was no law on the land or a great disaster had scattered the farmers, land tenancy was always a seller's market. The core conflict between landlords and tenants revolved around "eviction/resistance to eviction" and "raising/lowering rent."

The ways of Lingao were truly strange. Grain-paying landowners were the foundation of the court—if the Shorn Bandits treated them this way, they would eventually lose all support. He sighed softly, suddenly feeling that these Shorn Bandits were quite capable at "governing the world," but they clearly followed some crooked doctrine from who knew where. Carrying on like this was a waste of their talents as "craftsmen and merchants." Thinking of this, he felt a twinge of regret and couldn't help saying: "What a pity! These Shorn Bandits have the skills of Lu Ban and the commercial acumen of Tao Zhu, but unfortunately they don't follow the proper way." Looking at the youth again, he felt the boy had potential, and sighed: "The Shorn Bandits truly lead their students astray! Nothing but useless miscellaneous learning!"

Zhuo Yifan did not know that children of this age were at their peak of learning enthusiasm and curiosity. Though the youth had only attended school for a few months, the "Australians" had been in Nanbao for several years already. He was part of a new generation that had witnessed Nanbao transform from a desolate mountain village into a prosperous small town, experiencing the changes in life firsthand. Hearing Zhuo Yifan belittle the "Chiefs'" learning and claim that studying the Chiefs' teachings was useless, he couldn't help but argue: "Sir, isn't that too hasty a judgment? When I learn the knowledge of the Chiefs, I'll be able to grow more rice, weave more cloth, make better tools, and work more efficiently. We'll all be able to live in tiled houses, and generation after generation will never go hungry again..."

Hearing this, Zhuo Yifan sneered inwardly: So the Shorn Bandits relied on painting rosy pictures to fool the common folk. Country bumpkins would always be country bumpkins, deceived by a few words. Seeing the sincere expression on the youth's face, he had clearly been thoroughly bewitched. Very well—he himself was in a precarious situation, so why bother with this? He said nothing more.

He was severely wounded. Though the medicine had prevented inflammation, he had lost too much blood, and had been on the move all night. After talking for a while, he felt dizzy and lightheaded. His vigilance was keen; just before realizing he was about to pass out, he quickly tore off a piece of rag and stuffed it into the youth's mouth.

He didn't know how long had passed when he suddenly felt someone shaking his body. Zhuo Yifan opened his eyes to see Sima Qiudao's face creased with anxiety.

"Sima..."

"Where's the youth?!" Sima Qiudao blurted out.

Zhuo Yifan was startled. Looking toward the tree, he saw only a canvas strap on the ground. The book bag strap was made of sturdy canvas, but it was too stiff to have been pulled tight—the youth had managed to wriggle free.

"This is bad..."

"We must leave. This place is no longer safe!" Sima Qiudao said, helping Zhuo Yifan to his feet.

"What about Brother Huang and the others?"

Sima Qiudao's voice was filled with grief: "I entered the town, but before I got very far, I heard a commotion up ahead. The Shorn Bandits had sent a squad of Japanese mercenaries to surround the Huang Family Pharmacy!" His expression was pained. "I didn't dare go any closer, so I slipped out quietly."

Zhuo Yifan's heart sank, but there was nothing to be done now. Every man for himself—they could only pray for their own safety.

"Let's go around Nanbao. We're not far from the Li territory." He used a wooden stick to support himself as he walked forward.

Seeing Zhuo Yifan's pale face and bloodless lips, Sima Qiudao felt his heart tighten. He hurried forward a step, supporting Zhuo Yifan with his right arm. "Let me help you walk. We should reach Fan Bao Mountain before dark—after nightfall we can slip past the checkpoint. Seventh Master said there's no garrison there anymore, just a toll station. It should be easy to get through."

The two supported each other as they descended the mountain and crossed the fields toward a small hill ahead. Though Zhuo Yifan was being helped, every step sent pain shooting through his wound, especially his ribs—even the slightest breath brought extended agony.

Could he really be dying?

He struggled to move his feet, feeling his body grow heavier and his vision dimmer.

Fearing discovery by the Shorn Bandits, the two made a very wide detour, avoiding populated areas and keeping to dense forests. This made progress even more difficult.

After traveling for about half an hour, Sima Qiudao saw that Zhuo Yifan was swaying and could barely walk, so they sat down behind a large boulder.

"Rest here for a moment. I'll go find you some water." He loosened Zhuo Yifan's clothing and saw that blood had soaked through the bandages—the exertion of travel had reopened the wound.

Sima Qiudao was secretly worried: At this rate, Zhuo Yifan would die on the road sooner or later!

Their only hope now was to successfully escape into Li territory. With the connections of the righteous men waiting to receive them, perhaps they could find a hidden place for him to recuperate.

He picked up a bamboo tube to fetch water, but Zhuo Yifan grabbed his arm and said in a low voice: "Listen!"

Sima Qiudao strained to listen but heard nothing. Just as he was about to speak, a strange sound came from the direction of the small hill where they had rested the night before, growing from distant to near—it sounded like howling.

"It sounds like dogs barking," Sima Qiudao said. But this was not the barking of ordinary street dogs—it was more like a roar. He quickly pushed aside the bushes and looked toward the source of the sound. He saw a black-and-tan dog emerge from the woods on the opposite slope. The dog had a round head with drooping ears, and two large white spots above its eyes made it look like it had four eyes. Strangely, the dog appeared to have no tail!

Behind the dog were three or four soldiers wearing lacquered bamboo hats with swords at their hips—short, stocky men. Sima Qiudao knew these were the Japanese mercenaries kept by the Shorn Bandits!

The dog was chained, led by one man, constantly sniffing the ground. It was enormous, like a small calf. The handler could barely hold it back as it lunged forward repeatedly, nearly pulling him off his feet. Then three more dogs of the same type emerged from the forest, all sniffing the ground. Behind the dog handlers came more than a dozen soldiers with muskets, some Japanese and some regular troops. An officer-like figure stood beside a youth who was pointing and gesturing. Sima Qiudao was shocked—this was the young herbalist who had escaped!

Zhuo Yifan had also seen him now, and he silently cursed himself. But it was too late for regrets. He could only curl himself up, making himself as small a target as possible.

The dogs across the way sniffed the ground as they approached. Zhuo Yifan whispered: "They've probably caught the scent of the blood."

"Those crafty Shorn Bandits, using such tricks!" Sima Qiudao kept his gaze fixed ahead. "Brother Zhuo, we must split up, or when they catch up, neither of us will escape. Over this hill and a few more li is Fan Bao Mountain. Go slowly—as long as you get there before dark, you'll have a chance to slip through tonight!"

He paused before continuing: "I'll head down the hill now, cross that valley ahead, and take the hill on the left to reach Fan Bao Mountain to meet you."

Zhuo Yifan was alarmed—Sima Qiudao's path would take him practically under the noses of the Shorn Bandits. He was deliberately drawing them away.

"Brother Sima, you mustn't! I'm already gravely wounded—my time is probably short. You're not injured and can move fast. You go. Leave Yifan here to delay the Shorn Bandits' pursuit—I'll kill as many as I can!"

"Brother Zhuo, don't refuse! I, Sima Qiudao, crawled out of a pile of corpses and escaped with my life from the chaos of battle—every day I'm still alive is borrowed time. Besides, I can run fast. When the Shorn Bandits chase me with all their might, you'll have time to escape—every one of us who gets away counts!"

As he spoke, he tightened his clothes and belt, and tucked his knife more securely at his waist.

"Brother Qiudao!" Zhuo Yifan choked up, unable to speak.

Sima Qiudao looked at him and forced a smile: "Brother Zhuo, how do you know I can't get away? Rest easy! Back in the day, even Tartar cavalry couldn't catch me. What can a few dogs do? Until we meet again!" With that, he cupped his fists in salute: "Sima Qiudao takes his leave!"

He turned to go, but suddenly stopped. Without turning around, he said: "Brother Zhuo, if you can escape with your life—if you ever have the chance to go to Beijing—please burn a stick of incense at the grave of Lord Yuan Yingtai for me. When I served as his secretary, when Liaoyang fell, I should have died alongside him... Farewell!"
