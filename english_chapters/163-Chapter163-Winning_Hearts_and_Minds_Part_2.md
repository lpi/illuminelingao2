# Chapter 163: Winning Hearts and Minds (Part 2)

"Of course. As long as everyone unites—none of this is a dream." Wei Aiwen began painting the future: "Everyone's been here a month. How's life?"

"Nothing to complain—new clothes, good meals. Where else is such good work?"

"Even giving shoes. First issue I couldn't bear wearing—never had such good shoes." One soldier wiped tears. "Later Chief said must wear, worn-out ones get replaced. Living twenty-plus years—never owned proper shoes—" Crying—couldn't continue.

Actually these "good shoes" weren't even cloth shoes. Just straw sandals with cloth bottoms, straps with fabric strips. Slightly more comfortable than pure straw.

"But—" Wei Aiwen's tone shifted. "We poor people live well now. Will landlords, *qianhu* commanders, bandits, just watch us enjoy? Like you—thought Qiongzhou reclamation meant better life. Result?"

Everyone's eyes widened. Wang Tao saw timing was right, immediately teeth-grinding:

"No! Our labor's fruit—won't let them steal!"

"Correct!" Wei Aiwen raised his voice. "We commoners—generation after generation—bullied by gentry and officials. They live high—running low they rob us poor folk. Before we had no backbone—swallowed tears. Now with short-hair masters supporting us, having ironships, fast guns, having weapons ourselves—can we let them continue?"

"That depends whether my gun agrees." Wang Tao struck a heroic pose—Red Lantern's Li Yuhe style.

"Won't agree!" Crowd emotions finally mobilized. The company's Commune soldiers were vested interests—most moved.

"If they take by force?"

"Then beat the hell out of them!"

...

Wei Aiwen saw timing was ready: "United together—we can hold heads high. Better life too—no foraging weeds, daily white rice, fish and meat, good clothes and shoes. Everywhere building multi-stories, installing air conditioning, warm winter, cool summer. Electric lights—roomfuls bright—ten thousand times better than kerosene. Children go to school, study, compulsory education. Our nation prospers—manned spaceship succeeded, hosting Olympics! Anyway, all this will happen." Wei Aiwen secretly groaned—just got excited, mouth ran unchecked. Said things he shouldn't have. Fortunately, nobody reacted to "air conditioning" or "Olympics." A foraging-free life was most appealing.

The meeting ended. Ma Qianzhu grabbed Wei Aiwen, thumbs up: "Hey, Little Wei! You're amazing! Meeting was brilliantly successful. Everyone recalling past—teeth-grinding hatred. Your approach—at minimum they're now ours."

Wei Aiwen beamed: "Piece of cake! Future—I have more ideas!"

Inside—full of tears: My last Coca-Cola—traded for all this... Yu Eshui, you're too beastly!

Next day, Ma Qianzhu compiled Wei Aiwen's method into materials distributed to company commanders for study. Wang Tao was reluctantly expelled from barracks—now technically "enlisted soldier," not "Chief." Every company's theme meeting invited him for reports. This corporate trainer earned his living through talking. Amateur *pingshu* storyteller—his stories were vivid, emotionally rich, frequently cliffhanging—audiences couldn't stop. Scripts grew increasingly complex. Eventually Ma Qianzhu had to remind him not to overdo it.

But speak-bitterness education alone wasn't sufficient. Ma Qianzhu—based on Xi Yazhou's Salt Village experience—organized compiling a handbook focused on transmigrators' slogan: "Eliminate tyranny, Protect borders, Secure people."

Simultaneously, selecting active Commune soldiers, providing special political training.

"Political work's core is cultivating loyalty to us." Ma Qianzhu emphasized at the New Army officers' meeting. "Personally, I believe commoners don't necessarily love officialdom. Government to them is authority to obey—not our concept of nation."

Cultivating loyalty couldn't rely on slogans. No political theory matched defending self-interest. Post-WWII, the CCP launched massive land reform in liberated zones—capturing hearts, gaining stable bases and endless manpower. This was more effective than ten thousand lectures on class consciousness.

Providing New Army living standards far exceeding local commoners and even Commune members—they'd cherish this life, viewing transmigrators as great benefactors. Once interests were bound, they'd fight and die. For rootless, utterly alien transmigrators—tempting with benefits was most effective and fastest.

As for Ma Qianzhu's soldiers' committees—under transmigrator management they barely formed. Though many doubted soldier democracy—citing counter-examples—Ma Qianzhu persisted. Reason: after the Sanwan Reorganization, soldiers' committees and Party branches in companies had magical effects transforming old armies. Just like golden fingers.

If effective on Nationalist armies, then their New Army drawn from scratch would also benefit.

Ma Qianzhu naturally couldn't implement Party branches in companies—or the Executive Committee's right-wingers would eat him alive. But soldiers' committees had democracy's banner as protection—nobody could object. Showing importance, he personally chaired the battalion-level soldiers' committee.

Soldiers' committee's five tasks: First—participate in military management. Second—maintain discipline. Third—oversee company finances. Fourth—conduct mass work. Fifth—political education for soldiers.

Structure completely imitated Red Army era: lowest level at company. Full-company soldier assemblies elected 5–7 or 9 people for company committee executive, selecting one chairman. Battalion level: one representative per 5 soldiers formed the battalion soldiers' committee; 11–13 people for battalion executive, one chairman. Similarly upward. Each committee had no standing bodies.

Committee-military relationship: committees could only suggest or question specific issues—not directly interfere or handle. When soldiers met, commanders must attend—no closed-door sessions. Wartime, commanders could suspend committee activities—preventing extreme democratization.

Currently transmigrator-managed committees knew nothing about democracy. "Chiefs" required elections—they elected. What for, how—completely confused. Ma Qianzhu knew this phase was merely pro forma. But he disliked "democracy needs foundations" reasoning—sometimes half-cooked rice was necessary.

Transmigrators decided: soldiers start with simplest self-management—squad housekeeping, cleaning, food management. Once soldiers' interests were protected—having sense of ownership—enthusiasm would arise, responsibility for unit construction would strengthen.

Tian Liang was released from Bopu quarantine camp. During quarantine—daily classes, literacy, simple handicrafts. Body grew strong. Daily reading "textbooks" delivered to camp were now understandable. Tian Liang was pleased—clearly masters planned promoting them. At minimum some steward position. Otherwise—why teach slaves to read?

Spare time: sitting with similarly aged companions behind barbed wire, watching training grounds' lively scenes across the water. His best quarantine friend was three brothers, all surnamed Ruan—renamed Ruan Xiao'er, Ruan Xiaowu, Ruan Xiaoqi after arrival.

Now even fools realized: buying masters weren't ordinary gentry. What landlord trained private armies? Village militia he knew—during wandering he'd suffered from them, seen them robbing lone merchants on roads. But those yokels couldn't compare with men on the training grounds. Tian Liang had seen garrison drills in Guangzhou—supposedly elite regulars. Still felt inferior to these soldiers.

These soldiers—shaved heads, short jackets. Everything about them was efficient, sharp. Formation marching perfectly aligned—even legs raised in straight lines. Drilling with constant chanting. Eye-opening—yet strange: soldiers carried wooden sticks. Such wealthy masters couldn't afford spears?

Strangest: no rain—yet constant thunder. Sometimes all day uninterrupted. Later learned: masters firing cannons. Masters had cannons? Increasingly puzzling.

Finally one day—called up with belongings. Assignments coming.

Boys under 13 went to "Primary School"—reportedly for studying. Tian Liang at 15 wasn't eligible. Over-13s with good arithmetic or other talents went to "Technical School." Their group without special talents—swept into "Military-Political School."

This school proposed by Ma Qianzhu had no buildings. Children all issued uniforms, assigned to the Training Battalion's "Cadet Squad"—also marching with adults carrying wooden sticks.

Tian Liang wanted to know where Guo Fu was assigned—but girls' assignments were different days. Later learned from the food-delivery aunty: girls under 13 also went to Primary School. Others went to Technical School.

"Heard after learning skills at school—they'll become maids for 'Chiefs'." The aunty seemed envious. "Blessed children!"
