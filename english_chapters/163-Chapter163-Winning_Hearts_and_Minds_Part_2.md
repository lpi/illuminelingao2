# Chapter 163: Winning Hearts and Minds (Part 2)

"Of course. As long as everyone unites, none of this is a dream." Wei Aiwen began to paint a picture of the future. "Everyone's been here a month. How's life?"

"Nothing to complain about—new clothes, good meals. Where else can you find such good work?"

"They're even giving us shoes. With the first issue, I couldn't bear to wear them—I've never had such good shoes." One soldier wiped his tears. "Later, the Chief said we *must* wear them, and that worn-out ones would be replaced. Living twenty-plus years, I've never owned proper shoes..." He cried and couldn't continue.

Actually, these "good shoes" weren't even cloth shoes. They were just straw sandals with cloth soles and straps made of fabric strips. They were only slightly more comfortable than pure straw sandals.

"But—" Wei Aiwen's tone shifted. "We poor people live well now. Will the landlords, *qianhu* commanders, and bandits just watch us enjoy ourselves? Take you, for example—you thought Qiongzhou reclamation meant a better life. But what was the result?"

Everyone's eyes widened. Wang Tao saw that the timing was right and immediately ground his teeth.

"No! They won't let us keep the fruits of our labor!"

"Correct!" Wei Aiwen raised his voice. "We commoners, generation after generation, have been bullied by the gentry and officials. They live high, and when they run low, they rob us poor folk. Before, we had no backbone—we swallowed our tears. Now, with the short-hair masters supporting us, with their iron ships and fast guns, and with us having weapons ourselves—can we let them continue?"

"That depends on whether my gun agrees." Wang Tao struck a heroic pose in the style of Li Yuhe from *The Red Lantern*.

"We won't agree!" The crowd's emotions were finally mobilized. The soldiers enlisted from the Commune had a vested interest—most were moved.

"If they take by force?"

"Then beat the hell out of them!"

...

Wei Aiwen saw the timing was right. "United together, we can hold our heads high. We'll have a better life too—no foraging for weeds, daily white rice, fish and meat, good clothes and shoes. Everywhere we'll build multi-story buildings, install air conditioning, have warm winters and cool summers. Electric lights will make rooms bright—ten thousand times better than kerosene. Children will go to school, study, receive compulsory education. Our nation will prosper—manned spaceships, hosting the Olympics! Anyway, all this will happen." Wei Aiwen secretly groaned—he'd just gotten excited and his mouth had run unchecked. He'd said things he shouldn't have. Fortunately, nobody reacted to "air conditioning" or "Olympics." A foraging-free life was the most appealing part to them.

The meeting ended. Ma Qianzhu grabbed Wei Aiwen, giving him a thumbs up. "Hey, Little Wei! You're amazing! The meeting was brilliantly successful. Everyone recalling the past filled with teeth-grinding hatred. With your approach, at the very least, they are now ours."

Wei Aiwen beamed. "Piece of cake! For the future, I have more ideas!"

Inside, he was weeping: *My last Coca-Cola—traded for all this information... Yu Eshui, you're a beast!*

The next day, Ma Qianzhu compiled Wei Aiwen's method into materials distributed to company commanders for study. Wang Tao was reluctantly "discharged" from the barracks—now technically an "enlisted soldier," not a "Chief." Every company invited him to give reports at their themed meetings. This corporate trainer earned his living by talking. He was an amateur *pingshu* storyteller—his stories were vivid, emotionally rich, and filled with suspense—audiences couldn't stop listening. His scripts grew increasingly complex. Eventually, Ma Qianzhu had to remind him not to overdo it.

But "speaking bitterness" education alone wasn't sufficient. Ma Qianzhu—based on Xi Yazhou's Salt Village experience—organized the compiling of a handbook focused on the transmigrators' slogan: "Eliminate tyranny, Protect borders, Secure the people."

Simultaneously, they selected active Commune soldiers and provided special political training.

"Political work's core is cultivating loyalty to *us*," Ma Qianzhu emphasized at the New Army officers' meeting. "Personally, I believe commoners don't necessarily love officialdom. Government to them is authority to obey—not our concept of a nation-state."

Cultivating loyalty couldn't rely on slogans. No political theory matched the defense of self-interest. Post-WWII, the CCP launched massive land reform in liberated zones—capturing hearts, gaining stable bases and endless manpower. This was more effective than ten thousand lectures on class consciousness.

By providing New Army living standards far exceeding those of local commoners and even Commune members, they ensured the soldiers would cherish this life, viewing transmigrators as great benefactors. Once their interests were bound together, they'd fight and die for them. For the rootless, utterly alien transmigrators, tempting with benefits was the most effective and fastest method.

As for Ma Qianzhu's soldiers' committees—under transmigrator management, they barely formed. Though many doubted soldier democracy—citing counter-examples—Ma Qianzhu persisted. His reason: after the Sanwan Reorganization, soldiers' committees and Party branches in companies had magical effects in transforming old armies. Just like a cheat code.

If effective on Nationalist armies, then their New Army drawn from scratch would also benefit.

Ma Qianzhu naturally couldn't implement Party branches in the companies, or the Executive Committee's right-wingers would eat him alive. But soldiers' committees had the banner of democracy as protection—nobody could object. To show its importance, he personally chaired the battalion-level soldiers' committee.

The soldiers' committee had five tasks: First, participate in military management. Second, maintain discipline. Third, oversee company finances. Fourth, conduct mass work. Fifth, political education for soldiers.

The structure completely imitated the Red Army era: the lowest level was at the company. Full-company soldier assemblies elected 5–9 people for the company committee executive, selecting one chairman. At the battalion level, one representative per five soldiers formed the battalion soldiers' committee; 11–13 people formed the battalion executive, with one chairman. Similarly upward. Each committee had no standing bodies.

The committee-military relationship: committees could only suggest or question specific issues—not directly interfere or handle them. When soldiers met, commanders had to attend—no closed-door sessions. In wartime, commanders could suspend committee activities—preventing extreme democratization.

Currently, the transmigrator-managed committees knew nothing about democracy. "Chiefs" required elections—so they elected. What for, how—they were completely confused. Ma Qianzhu knew this phase was merely pro forma. But he disliked the reasoning that "democracy needs foundations"—sometimes, eating half-cooked rice was necessary.

The transmigrators decided: soldiers would start with the simplest self-management—squad housekeeping, cleaning, food management. Once soldiers' interests were protected—having a sense of ownership—enthusiasm would arise, and responsibility for unit construction would strengthen.

Tian Liang was released from the Bopu quarantine camp. During the quarantine, he had daily classes on literacy and simple handicrafts. His body grew strong. Daily reading "textbooks" delivered to the camp were now understandable. Tian Liang was pleased—clearly, the masters planned on promoting them. At minimum, to some steward position. Otherwise, why teach slaves to read?

In his spare time, he sat with similarly aged companions behind the barbed wire, watching the training grounds' lively scenes across the water. His best friends in quarantine were three brothers, all surnamed Ruan—renamed Ruan Xiao'er, Ruan Xiaowu, and Ruan Xiaoqi after arrival.

Now even fools realized that the slave-buying masters weren't ordinary gentry. What landlord trained private armies? He knew village militia—during his wandering he'd suffered from them, seen them robbing lone merchants on roads. But those yokels couldn't compare with the men on the training grounds. Tian Liang had seen garrison drills in Guangzhou—supposedly elite regular troops. He still felt inferior to these soldiers.

These soldiers had shaved heads and short jackets. Everything about them was efficient and sharp. Formation marching was perfectly aligned—even legs were raised in straight lines. They drilled with constant chanting. It was eye-opening—yet strange: soldiers carried wooden sticks. Such wealthy masters couldn't afford spears?

The strangest thing was that there was no rain, yet there was constant thunder. Sometimes it went on all day uninterrupted. Later he learned that it was the masters firing cannons. The masters had cannons? It was increasingly puzzling.

Finally, one day he was called up with his belongings. Assignments were coming.

Boys under 13 went to "Primary School"—reportedly for studying. Tian Liang, at 15, wasn't eligible. Those over 13 with good arithmetic or other talents went to "Technical School." Their group, without special talents, was swept into the "Military-Political School."

This school, proposed by Ma Qianzhu, had no buildings. The children were all issued uniforms and assigned to the Training Battalion's "Cadet Squad"—also marching with adults carrying wooden sticks.

Tian Liang wanted to know where Guo Fu was assigned—but girls' assignments were on different days. Later he learned from the food-delivery aunty that girls under 13 also went to Primary School. Others went to Technical School.

"Heard after learning skills at school, they'll become maids for 'Chiefs'." The aunty seemed envious. "Blessed children!"
