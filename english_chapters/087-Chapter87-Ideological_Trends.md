# Chapter 87 - Ideological Trends

Wu De's other task was preventing escape. Once outside labor began, most likely someone would try to escape. He must completely eliminate such things from happening. One successful escape would give others similar hope.

Therefore, before starting outside labor, he requested the Executive Committee that the military team members assigned to guard the captives must be sharpshooters, preferably equipped with scopes and night vision goggles.

"What do you need such strong people for?" He Ming felt a bit strange.

"Can kill with one hit when finding someone escaping." Wu De explained. The more crisp and decisive, the more cruel and ruthless the stop, the more effective it can be. When the fear level is enough, guards might not even be needed.

Then, he scattered those who said they were willing to join and inserted them into various labor teams, instructing that if anyone talked about escaping, they could report directly to him.

He didn't promise these people anything, nor did he give any benefits. To gain trust, one must show the courage of selling oneself to seek patronage.

Probably because that battle gave many people too strong an impression, or perhaps the life they lived before was not much different from now. Anyway, except for reports that a few small landlords and rich peasants complained that no one came to redeem them and farm work at home couldn't be done, there were no abnormal situations.

Because of the injury on his leg, Fu Buer didn't go to be a laborer with others, but recuperated in the tent with other wounded. Every day was either changing dressing or eating. The food was not bad; although the rice porridge was thin, it was enough. Seeing a few pirate doctors in white coats coming in and out every day to check injuries, Fu Buer still admired: after all, doctors have the heart of parents. The invisible fear also lessened a lot.

There were originally twenty or thirty injured captives. Some didn't survive the recovery after surgery and died. Some recovered quickly and were sent to the labor team to work. Fu Buer's long-term laborer Ma Peng only sprained his foot and was sent away very quickly. In the past, Fu Buer wouldn't even look at this long-term laborer directly, but now that he was gone, he felt very nostalgic. Right now, there wasn't a single acquaintance around him.

A few days later, Ma Peng found a chance to visit him. Said he was working for the pirates. He didn't call them pirates now, but respectfully called them "Chiefs". This term sounded very fresh to Fu Buer. Ma Peng now cut wood and dug earth every day. Had white rice porridge for every meal, and could eat salted fish every two or three days. Working hours were only six shichen (12 hours? No, 6 shichen is 12 hours, maybe he meant 6 hours? Context check: "一天干活也就六个时辰" -> 6 shichen = 12 hours. That's a lot. But maybe 17th century people considered it normal? Or maybe he meant 6 hours? "Hours" in modern terms. "Only 6 shichen" implies it's not too much? Farmers work sunrise to sunset. 12 hours is basically all day. Maybe he meant 6 hours. But "shichen" is 2 hours. I will translate literal "6 shichen"). Just being forced to bathe every day was annoying, but he was used to it. Overall, life was passable. Hearing that pirates gave white rice and fish to eat, Fu Buer was a bit surprised: his family gave long-term laborers sweet potatoes all year round, and would only give rice and salted fish during busy farming seasons plus rewards. Although it had nothing to do with him, he was still pained by the pirates' extravagance.

Ma Peng also told many incredible things, such as the machine that could move by itself and make thousands or tens of thousands of brick adobes in a while; and the thing that smoked all over and roared, "Chiefs" didn't allow them to approach, said to be the source of all power, just needing to add firewood constantly, consuming more firewood in a day than a village used for cooking. Others included stoves mounted on four-wheeled carts, magical saws that could saw off a big tree at once...

He spoke happily, and Fu Buer wasn't very surprised hearing it: he himself had seen many new and strange things these days. He was already mentally prepared for the pirates' fresh gadgets.

"...Chief said, those who work well, if willing to stay, can turn into employees."

"Employee (Zhi Gong)? Isn't that being a pirate."

"Not being a pi...rate," Ma Peng said in a low voice, "Not qualified to be that yet. Called employee, this lowly one doesn't know how to write it either. Anyway, eating three meals a day, meat in every meal, and can rest one day a month or something..." Ma Peng had a look of envy.

"Pah! You want to follow bandits?" Fu Buer saw his long-term laborer about to fall into the abyss of rebellion. He didn't care much about Ma Peng's life or death, just afraid of losing one laborer, so he hurriedly reminded him this was a dangerous road.

"I dare not. Master is right, that leads to beheading. But heard some people are willing. Besides, the Grand Master in the county can't do anything to them now, what can we small people do." Ma Peng worked for the pirates for ten days or so, and his mouth seemed to become flexible too, "Anyway, it's all working..."

"Ma Peng, you are harboring confused thoughts!" Fu Buer scolded, "Once the court's great army arrives, won't it be turned to ashes! You attach yourself to pirates, by then you will even get the name of follower of bandits!"

Ma Peng opened his mouth, probably not knowing what to say.

Fu Buer took the opportunity to ask if there was news from home. Ma Peng said he had been working all the time and didn't see anyone coming from the village. Moreover, the pirates' construction sites were many and large now. He was often driven to work here for a few days and there for a few days. Almost confused about the places. Fu Buer was very anxious in his heart, thinking even if they wanted to extort ransom, they should send someone to negotiate. Why did the pirates not even make a sound?

Because Ma Peng still had work to do, he left in a hurry. The injury on Fu Buer's leg was almost healed, and he could walk around. Before, he dared not go out, afraid that if pirates saw him, they would think he was running away and chop him. Now seeing Ma Peng coming in and out very freely, he took a stick as a crutch and went out of the tent to walk around. There were barbed wires all around the tent. He shivered as soon as he saw this thing. The scene of bloody corpses hanging on the barbed wire during the battle that day was really too terrifying, making him unable to forget.

Outside the barbed wire was a wooden tower. A small pirate stood below bored, carrying a bird gun with a short sword attached. Fu Buer had witnessed the power of this thing. It fired densely like rain. Once the gun rang, people around died in patches. With such formidable firearms, let alone their militia, even if the official army came, it would be tough. However, Fu Buer also knew clearly that expecting the official army to rescue them was a dream. The Daming official army was too lazy to care about the life and death of them common people. If they really came to suppress bandits, fear that the first thing they would do is chop off the heads of these hostages to claim credit and reward—when he went to Guangzhou, he heard unknown amount of such things—"Guest troops are like bandits".

Suddenly a strange roar came from the air, also like the sound of firecrackers exploding. Followed by a rumbling roar. Looking towards the sound, saw a red steel monster roaring, spewing filthy black smoke, gnawing at the ground with incredible power. The scene in front of him had never been seen even in the most terrible nightmare. Fu Buer's face was pale, almost falling down.

Watching the iron plates creaking, this behemoth moved slowly, then with a roar, a huge iron shovel was lifted fiercely from the soil. Mud and crushed stones sprinkled around like a waterfall. Everything seemed so soul-stirring.

Fu Buer was surprised speechless. With such power, what could resist? Let alone more than a thousand official troops in Qiongzhou Prefecture, even if troops from several provinces were gathered to suppress, what could they do? They have such great power and are engaging in large-scale construction here. If not for long-term residence, what is it for?

Thinking of this, his mind became very chaotic, unable to figure out whether it was a blessing or a curse. Squatted on the ground for a while, at a loss.

Wu De took the latest draft of "Captive Ideological Trends" to report to the Executive Committee. The Executive Committee had high expectations for this group of captives, wanting to use them as seeds for future regime construction, so it required a report on the ideological state of these people every Monday to make corresponding policy adjustments.

Executive Committee Building—although it was actually a simple prefabricated small building, everyone was used to calling it the Office Building to show style—now it has completely changed appearance. The barbed wire on all four sides was removed, and a high wall was built. A sentry was set up in front of the wooden double-opening gate. Two rows of bungalows were newly built on the two wings of the office building—since there were masons among the captives, building a few old-style brick-wood structure tile houses was naturally not a problem. The ground of the compound was all paved with blue bricks, and two flower beds were built on the left and right. A Beijing 212 was parked in the yard, and several motorcycles and bicycles were scattered. At first glance, it looked very much like a county committee compound in a certain county in the 60s-70s.

Wu De didn't enter the main building, but went directly into a tile house on the east side. The sign with black characters on a white background in front of the door wrote "Printing Room" in correct art characters. This was the place where the Executive Committee edited and printed documents and various internal publications.

This kind of internal publication started editing since the Executive Committee moved to Bairen Beach. Although Ding Ding clamored to run a Lingao Times, the Executive Committee always rejected his request on the grounds that the time was not ripe, but let him be responsible for internal publications. Such internal publications ranged from being circulated among all transmigrators to only the Executive Committee. "Captive Ideological Trends" belonged to materials restricted to the Executive Committee and the Theory and Policy Group, with only five copies printed per issue.

The printing room was dark. To save electricity, lights were not turned on unless necessary for work. The room was large, with a fast mimeograph machine inside. Wax paper, steel plates, and stylus pens were spread on a large table taken from the ship. In the corner were two computers and several Epson 24-pin printers. Boxes of white paper and printed documents were piled in the corner.

There was no one in the room. Wu De picked up a proof sheet from the table casually. It looked like a single-sheet tabloid. The front page had two crooked bucket-sized brush characters written like tadpole script. looking carefully, it turned out to be: "Lingao Express", with a signature below: Inscribed by Xi Yazhou.

Xi Yazhou's head seemed to be healed; he even inscribed for the publication. Wu De started reading. The newspaper reported the victory of the "First Counter-Encirclement and Suppression" at length, exaggeratingly reporting that the local government dispatched an army of three thousand people, but under the strike of our mighty Heavenly Army, all were wiped out in just half an hour. Although signed as the military commentator of this newspaper, that style similar to war game instructions obviously came from the hand of Xi Yazhou, who was unfortunately injured on D-Day.

Then there was an editorial, signed: Special Commentator of this Newspaper. It commented: The reactionary Ming government will surely be completely wiped out by our wise and great Transmigration Party.

Then there was a theoretical article introducing Marxism. Of course, this Mr. Ma became a hermit born in the Wanli period. The signature was Du Wen. However, although this article was very long and listed many numbers, Wu De couldn't understand what it was writing about from beginning to end. Estimated that even Marx himself wouldn't know if he read it.

At the bottom of the newspaper, there was another article "The Blood and Tears Accusation of Lingao Farmers", which wrote about the miserable experiences of many farmers. Wu De felt very familiar—wasn't this excerpted from the "Summary of Captive Interrogation" copied to him after Little Guo interrogated the captives? Truly all articles in the world are one big copy. It also added a lot of inflammatory content, and its imagination was simply outrageous. The author consciously did not sign his name.
