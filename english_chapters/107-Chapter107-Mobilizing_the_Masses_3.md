# Chapter 107 - Mobilizing the Masses (3)

Xi Yazhou had a well-thought-out plan: "We will handle the dealings with the government. You don't need to worry." In fact, he already had a plan in his heart—we can't gain the upper hand by playing tricks and schemes with ancient people; we can only break through with force.

The people from the salt village looked at each other, seeming somewhat disbelieving. However, these Short-haired Masters before them were not benevolent men and believing women (easy pushovers). They defeated hundreds of village braves at Bairen Beach, so maybe they really could take it down. Xi Yazhou was not eager to prove anything, just asked: "If we take back the salt tax, can everyone's hearts be united? At that time, the two old bastards of the Gou family will definitely not be reconciled and will come to cause trouble—"

"Afraid of a bird (damn thing)?" Tan Chengqing shook his shoulders and said with great certainty, "With his few people, any able-bodied man in the village can deal with two or three of them!"

Tan Guihuang sighed: "It's just that we don't have swords or guns. Our village has suffered enough because of this. With two empty hands, we don't even have a tool to vent our anger."

"We have plenty of weapons," Xi Yazhou said.

"Then we can be united," a surge of heat welled up in Tan Chengqing's heart, "Damn it, people have to die anyway. Living like this is too damn cowardly. A good man can't take this turtle anger (stifled anger). If we have swords and guns," he gritted his teeth, "I'll fight a few of them no matter what."

"Good!" Xi Yazhou said excitedly, "The problem now is first to let the villagers fill their stomachs, and second to find a way to save the village head and the others first. Then we'll talk about other things."

"Right!" The few people said excitedly together, "Once people's hearts are settled, we can do anything."

"How many people are there in the village now?" Xi Yazhou asked Tan Guihuang, "How many able-bodied men, women, and children respectively?"

"Probably more than four hundred people left. Mainly women, children, and the elderly. Most able-bodied men are hiding outside reclaiming land. Together there are more than two hundred."

Not counting the able-bodied men outside, just supplying more than four hundred people in the village, calculated at a low standard of half a jin of rice per person per day, the daily grain consumption would be two hundred and fifty jin. This was not a small number for the transmigrators whose grain had already been consumed by more than half. In addition, the people from the salt field who were taken away had to be rescued. It seemed that fighting Gou the Elder, this big household, was inevitable!

"If all able-bodied men return to the village," Xi Yazhou asked Tan Guihuang, "how much salt can be produced every day?"

The father and son calculated face to face: "More than two thousand jin can be produced every day. The weather has been good recently; these are good days for drying salt."

Xi Yazhou thought, this equals one ton a day. For manual labor, it is quite a lot, but for the chemical department, one ton of salt is not even enough for the daily raw material consumption of a small chemical plant. It seems there is still much room for improvement in salt production methods. But this is a story for later. The main topic right now is to treat salt as a commodity and exchange it for grain and cloth as soon as possible.

Lingao itself did not have the capacity to consume so much edible salt. In fact, most of Hainan's salt was exported to the mainland. Markets had to be found for this salt. There was no news back from Xiao Zishan since he went to Guangzhou. Even if he was notified immediately that there was a large batch of salt available for sale here, distant water could not quench near thirst. He thought for a moment and asked again:

"Do the merchants who originally came to your village to collect salt still come now?"

"How dare they come!" Tan Guihuang said, "Since Great Household Gou colluded with villains, robbed a salt boat from Leizhou, and killed all the merchants and boat owners, no one dares to come here to buy salt anymore."

"Are there any familiar ones? Just ask them to come collect salt. We can provide armed protection." Xi Yazhou vowed solemnly, seeing their doubtful eyes, "What, we have such a big iron ship, are we still afraid of a few small pirates?"

Tan Guihuang nodded, as if hardening his heart: "Done! I received these salt merchants in the past, and I am familiar with their trade names. There is a Hokkien named Liu Gang over in Leizhou. He is a small merchant. Although he also buys quotas to sell salt, he often mixes in smuggling. His guts might be bigger. I'll make a trip to Haikang!" (Note: Leizhou has two subordinate counties: Haikang and Xuwen)

"Let me go instead. You are old," Tan Chengqing saw his old father going on a long journey and hurriedly stopped him.

"Going to Haikang is just crossing the sea. People must stay in the village all the same."

"We will send a boat to take you across the sea tomorrow." Although Xi Yazhou knew doing so was a bit making a mountain out of a molehill—crossing the sea from Maniao to Leizhou Peninsula wouldn't take half a day even rowing a wooden boat. But this moment was exactly the time to show the transmigrators' strength.

"Chengqing," Xi Yazhou said to Tan Chengqing, "please go call back the able-bodied men fleeing outside tomorrow. We will set up a regiment (Tuan)!"

"Set up a regiment?"

"Yes. The Gou family can have family guards and village braves. Such a big salt village can't do without its own armed forces. Even if the Gou family doesn't come, you have to guard against pirates. Tomorrow we will allocate weapons from Bairen Beach."

"Done! I'll go do this tomorrow." Tan Chengqing got excited.

"Good, next I have to talk about saving people." Xi Yazhou said, "Saving people is not difficult. However, once saved back, you will have torn face with the Gou family. Do you have the determination to fight to the end?" He deliberately said, "If you don't have this determination, then using soft tactics is also fine. You can gather two hundred yin of salt first, then go redeem the people." This was also a method of goading.

The father and son looked at each other and said in unison: "Do it! In the past, we yielded an inch, and he advanced a foot. If we don't overthrow him, sooner or later this salt field and salt village will all become the Gou family's!"

"Okay, then we will arrange to save people. Find me some people familiar with the Gou family's situation tomorrow."

"Good! We will go back now to tell the villagers and arrange it together."

These few people disappeared into the night outside, and the atmosphere in the tent also became much more lively. Everyone felt happy about being able to open up such a situation today.

Xi Yazhou discussed some matters with everyone again and decided to transfer a batch of grain from Bairen City tomorrow for relief, and weapons would also be transported together—anyway, the transmigrators couldn't use these things (spears/swords likely implied, or old weapons).

Early the next morning, there was some vitality in the village. While continuing to build their camp, the work team people looked at the beach, where figures were moving; people were already working. Compared to the desolate scene of yesterday, they had much confidence. Many people who originally held skeptical or even mocking attitudes towards their propaganda work yesterday were now convinced by Xi Yazhou's set of "old-fashioned policies."

The sun shone on the churning seawater, reflecting mottled and flashing light. This unremarkable new day meant the beginning of a new era for the residents of the salt field.

Outside the ruined walls of Ge Hong Temple, curious children gathered—unlike the suspicious adults, these short-hairs bringing sweet and sour candy balls seemed like people from another world to them. They watched intently as these people worked with strange tools. These people's things looked so exquisite and luxurious—even a candy ball was wrapped in colorful transparent paper. Starting from last night, the children spontaneously formed a craze for collecting fruit candy wrappers. Every time a short-hair walked by, everyone held their breath, watching if he would take out a candy ball. Everyone would stare closely at the lucky one, watching him impatiently stuff the candy ball into his mouth and pinch the paper in his hand like holding some treasure.

"These children can all be our future new blood." Wang Luobin said to Xi Yazhou. Seeing these sallow, emaciated, half-naked children, the idea of the first comprehensive industrial technical school that he had envisioned for a long time popped up again.

"Then let's open one." Xi Yazhou said, "How did land reform work teams do it? Struggle against landlords, distribute land, and wasn't there also running night schools—"

"Correct!" Wang Luobin nodded excitedly, "I forgot all about this." He said somewhat ashamedly: "I always thought of it like a regular school, with school buildings, dormitories, cafeterias, laboratories... So I thought about it several times, always feeling that materials were still scarce and the timing for running a school was not ripe. Actually, to run a school, just a room and a blackboard are enough!"

"We have thirty people; every one of us can be a teacher for the children." Xi Yazhou said, "Otherwise, wouldn't everyone be bored to death at night?" Running a night school could not only conduct education but also give everyone something to kill time in these extremely boring nights, killing two birds with one stone.

"Good, then I'll go prepare for this immediately." Wang Luobin walked away excitedly.

The first construction task for the transmigrators was still energy. As a small independent stronghold by the sea, wind turbines were the best choice. Lingao itself had relatively abundant wind resources.

He Ying led the team members to hoist a heavy packing case onto a high platform built of piled stones using a primitive derrick and pulley method—judging from the appearance of the stone platform, it must have been a bell and drum tower in the past, but the building on the stone platform had collapsed many years ago. There was only a thick layer of rubble and mud on the surface. He Ying wiped his sweat and measured the altitude. Including the height of this platform of more than 5 meters, this place was nearly 10 meters above sea level. The foundation was relatively solid, and the windward side was open. The wind was really strong; the sweat dried in a while. He couldn't help shivering. This should be a suitable place.

An hour later, a two-meter-high frame shaped like a high-voltage line tower was set up.

Two hours later, a thing resembling an electric fan head was installed on the frame.

Two and a half hours later, the fan blades of this head were installed.

A black box had been placed under the frame, with a thick cable connecting to the "electric fan" on the frame.

He Ying stepped on the frame and forcefully pulled down the fan blade safety. The "electric fan" whirred and started to turn, and the black box emitted a long beep. Clean Energy Facility No. 1 started working.

This wind turbine was a ready-made purchase. The blades were fiberglass, the generator was a small DC motor, and there were storage batteries in the transformer box under the frame. In fact, the generated electricity charged the battery first, and then supplied power. This way the voltage would be relatively stable, with a power of only 400 watts.

Besides lighting, 400 watts of electricity could only run things like computers, which was enough for now. In the energy department's plan, once the situation in the salt field stabilized, a small thermal power generator would be put into production here—it was said to be self-produced, and people from the machinery group were drawing boiler blueprints recently.

Hopefully, this self-produced small generator wouldn't cause any trouble; he didn't plan to come and install it then. He Ying, who was installing the generator, muttered to himself. He brought a small generator privately, but it was requisitioned by the Planning Committee as soon as he landed. Because of this generator, he became a member of the energy group of the Ministry of Industry.
