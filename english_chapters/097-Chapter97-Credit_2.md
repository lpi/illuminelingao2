# Chapter 97 - Credit (2)

"Yes, okay... I know." Wu Nanhai put down the phone with some pride and surprise. It seemed that the credit of this "Bairen Production Team" work point coupon had been initially established.

"It works?"

"Yes, it works!" Wu Nanhai nodded excitedly, "Hu Yicheng called just now, said all the extra food prepared today was sold out in a flash. There are still many people waving tickets wanting to buy. The masses' enthusiasm for consumption is very high."

"Okay!" Cheng Dong slapped the table, "We can consider expanding the scope of goods supplied. Besides food, some daily necessities can also be provided."

"Daily necessities?" Wu De thought for a while, "Toothbrushes, towels, soap?"

"These things are temporarily scarce for ourselves, and we can't supply much." Cheng Dong shook his head, "I mean things like needles and thread, coarse cloth, pottery bowls and pots. These things can be purchased from local merchants or produced by ourselves."

"Pottery?" Wu De's eyes lit up, "Right, there are potters in the captives. We can let them fire pottery. There is clay near the brick kiln."

"Correct. Also bamboo weaving, straw weaving. These local specialties can be organized for production." Cheng Dong continued, "We can open a supply and marketing cooperative in the captive camp, specifically selling these things. Accepting only work point coupons."

"Supply and Marketing Cooperative..." Wu De chewed on this word full of historical sense, "Good name. It sounds like a socialist collective economy."

"Actually, it's a company store." Cheng Dong laughed, "Exploiting workers twice. Once in production, once in consumption."

"Don't say it so harshly," Wu De retorted, "We are improving their quality of life. You see, they used to have no place to buy these things even if they had money. Now we provide them with convenience and stable prices."

"Yes, yes, serving the people."

With the successful promotion of work point coupons, the labor enthusiasm of the captives rose unprecedentedly. Everyone hoped to earn more work points to exchange for delicious food or save up to buy useful things in the future. The phenomenon of laziness decreased significantly, and efficiency improved greatly.

Wu De struck while the iron was hot and announced a new policy: "Model Worker" selection. A model worker is selected every month. In addition to material rewards, a red flower is awarded to be worn on the chest, and the photo is posted on the honor roll at the entrance of the camp.

This honor roll was Wu De's proud work. He asked someone to take photos of the selected model workers with a digital camera, print them out with a color printer, and paste them on a wooden board made by carpenters, covered with a glass frame to prevent rain. Above the photos were the four large characters "Labor is Glorious" written by Ma Qianzhu.

For these Ming Dynasty farmers, having their portraits hung in a public place for everyone to admire was an honor they dared not even think of before. In their concept, only officials or ancestral tablets in ancestral halls could enjoy such treatment. Now, as long as they work hard, they can have this glory. This greatly stimulated their vanity and sense of honor.

On the day the first batch of model workers' photos were posted, almost all captives gathered in front of the honor roll to watch. Pointing and talking, eyes full of envy. The selected people stood under the honor roll with chests high, accepting everyone's gaze, looking very proud.

"Look, that's me!" Wang Tian pointed to his photo and shouted to the people around him, "Am I handsome?"

"Handsome, handsome!" Everyone echoed, but muttered in their hearts: Just your wretched look, where is handsome. But envy was real.

Lin Xing was also elected as a model worker. He looked at his photo, feeling excited in his heart. He felt that he was finally respected here, not just a captive or a coolie. He secretly swore to work harder and not let the "Chiefs" down.

In addition to spiritual encouragement, material stimulation also followed. The Supply and Marketing Cooperative opened. Although it was just a simple shed, the dazzling array of goods inside opened the eyes of the captives. Besides the food mentioned before, there were indeed needles, thread, coarse cloth, pottery, and some small hardware tools made by the transmigrators themselves, such as small knives, awls, etc.

Business was booming on the first day of opening. The most popular ones were naturally food and salt. But soon, someone started buying needles, thread, and cloth. These were necessary for patching clothes. Some people also bought pottery bowls to hold rice.

Ma Peng squeezed in the crowd, holding the work point coupons he had saved for a long time. He wanted to buy a piece of cloth to make a new dress for his mother. Although he couldn't go home yet, he could save it first. He selected a piece of blue sturdy blue cloth, spent all his savings, but held the cloth happily, feeling sweet in his heart.

Wu De stood in the distance watching the bustling scene, smiling on his face. He knew his plan had succeeded. These captives had been tied to the chariot of the transmigrators. Through interest binding and spiritual control, they were gradually transforming into identifying with this new regime.

However, a new problem arose. With the increase in material consumption, the inventory of the transmigrators began to be tight again. Especially salt and cloth. Salt relied on the salt field, which hadn't produced salt yet. Cloth relied on inventory and purchase, which was not a long-term solution.

"We must solve the production problem ourselves." Ma Qianzhu said at the Executive Committee meeting, "Salt field construction must be accelerated. For cloth, we can try to purchase cotton for spinning and weaving, or encourage locals to plant cotton."

"Cotton planting takes a cycle. It's too late for urgent needs." Wu Nanhai said, "I suggest organizing a trade team to go to the mainland or other places in Hainan to purchase."

"Trade team..." Wen Desi pondered, "This involves the issue of external communication. Our ships are limited, and we don't have safe channels."

"We can use the relationship with the pirates." Xi Yazhou suggested, "Or find local big merchants to cooperate."

"This needs long-term consideration. For now, let's solve the salt problem first." Ma Qianzhu set the tone, "Salt is a strategic material. Not only for eating, but also for chemical industry. We must hold it in our own hands."

"The salt field at Maniao Peninsula mentioned before, how is the reconnaissance going?"

"The reconnaissance team has come back. The conditions there are good, suitable for building a large salt field. But there is a patrol inspection division of the Ming army nearby."

"Patrol inspection division? Just a few shrimp soldiers and crab generals." Bei Wei said disdainfully, "I'll take a squad to destroy them."

"Don't act recklessly." Wen Desi stopped him, "We just reached a peace agreement with the county. We can't start a war lightly. We can try to negotiate or buy/rent land first."

"Buy land for a salt field? Will the government agree?"

"Money can make the devil turn the millstone. As long as the price is right, I don't believe those corrupt officials won't be moved."

"Okay, let the Ministry of Foreign Affairs handle this. If negotiation fails, then consider military means."

While the Executive Committee was discussing the salt field, good news came from the Exploration Team: they found limestone and quartz sand mines. This meant that the production of cement and glass had raw materials.

"Great!" Mei Wan was overjoyed, "With cement and glass, our construction speed can be doubled. Bairen City can truly take shape."

"Also, we can build brick houses for the captives. Let them settle down completely." Wu De added.

"Brick houses? That's too extravagant." Someone objected.

"Not extravagant. Settling down leads to contentment with one's work. Only by letting them live in good houses can they treat this place as home." Wu De insisted.

"Okay, approved. But they have to build it themselves." Ma Qianzhu agreed.

So, a vigorous construction movement began in Bairen City.
