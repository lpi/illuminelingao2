# Chapter 1090 - Post-War

However, Lu Wenyuan and Chen Sigen still disagreed with releasing rebel prisoners, believing this was a sign of weakness. Finally, both sides reached a compromise: only release more than four hundred combat soldier prisoners, and transport auxiliary soldiers back to Lingao to be handed over to the Labor Camp for use.

As for the corpses all over the ground, Zhu Mingxia wanted to incinerate them on the spot, but he really couldn't find so much firewood. Burying them was difficult as the ground was frozen. Finally, it was decided that Lu Yang would send *Dafa* boats to transport the corpses to the open sea for sea burial.

All recovered wounded were disposed of by Xie Yao and his team of health workers. Although Zhu Mingxia instructed Xie Yao not to spare medicines as long as they could be saved without leaving serious disabilities, Shi Niaoren had clearly stated before departure to let naturalized medical officers practice more. But the ability of him and his subordinates was limited after all. In short, dozens of people died every day.

But those who could survive, whether missing arms or legs, would have a place for their talents in Lingao.

Ma Linxi was "picked back." Although he climbed onto the floating ice after falling into the sea, being blown by the cold wind after soaking wet, his body was almost frozen stiff. He only crawled onto the sandbar relying on a strong will to survive, pulling a rebel big flag to wrap himself. However, his body temperature gradually dropped, and he began to enter a trance state. If he hadn't been kicked hard, he would probably have frozen to death alive.

The laborers in the refugee camp collecting prisoners were very careful. Regardless of lying prone or supine, as long as it was a basic complete human shape, they would kick it. If there was a slight reaction, they would hurry to load it onto a wheelbarrow—Manor Lord Lu said: one biscuit for bringing back a living person.

This kind of biscuit was now hard currency in the refugee camp. Although the masters were kind, they never let refugees eat full. So when collecting prisoners, everyone held their breath to find the most living people—anyway, the masters said, as long as they were still breathing when sent to Doctor Xie, it counted.

Ma Linxi was lifted onto a wheelbarrow like this, next to a combat soldier who was shot in the chest and bleeding continuously. Blood dripped on him all the way. Just like this, he arrived at Xie Yao's temporary infirmary.

Doctor Xie's temporary infirmary was like a slaughterhouse, floor full of blood and severed limbs. Doctor Xie was red all over, holding bloody pliers in hand coming out—Ma Linxi almost fainted from fright.

Doctor Xie first instructed subordinates to cut the rags on Ma Linxi's body, looked carefully at the body, asked him a few sentences, and immediately said loudly: "It's frostbite, prepare the big pot!"

Ma Linxi thought they were going to boil a living person. Before he could open his mouth to beg for mercy, two strong young men came over, lifted him up and walked quickly for a dozen steps. Seeing a shed in front, there was indeed a big pot inside, probably used in the kitchen of a certain big temple. Fire was burning underneath, and water vapor filled the inside.

Before Ma Linxi could scream, the two people soaked him into the pot.

Ma Linxi was originally prepared for skin peeling and bone rotting death, but unexpectedly: the water in the pot was very hot, but not to the point of scalding people. He was lying on a bamboo woven board. He only felt the body that was already frozen numb gradually regain feeling.

The two young men soaked him for more than ten minutes, then fished him out of the pot. After letting him dry his body by the fire, they gave him a lined robe made of recycled cloth (*Gengsheng Bu*), filled with reed flowers inside, and a pair of reed sandals—although wearing them wasn't considered warm, at least he wouldn't freeze to death.

Ma Linxi was taken to a person looking like a clerk, reported his name, age, and native place. After hearing that he was a carpenter, he received a C-Card. This kind of card was specially issued to refugees with technical expertise. According to the table formulated by Yang Yun, Director of the Labor Department of the Civil Affairs People's Commission, craftsmen among recruited and recovered refugees were divided into thirteen categories and fifty-one types. Anyone matching one of these fifty-one types could enjoy the C-Card supply standard.

This standard was slightly higher than the A-Card standard for ordinary refugees and slightly lower than the Z-Card standard. They also formed a separate camp within the refugee camp. When shipping, they were also arranged as early as possible—especially since Taiwan and Jeju currently needed a large number of technical personnel like blacksmiths and carpenters to assist.

Ma Linxi didn't know he had received special treatment, but seeing that he had clothes and shoes, and received a bowl of warm porridge after registration, he was already tearful with gratitude—anyway, he looked like a human again!

Here Zhu Mingxia summoned several captured Thousand-man Commanders and Patrol Leaders. Quite a few of these small officers were caught. Several of them were kicked and beaten by other refugees as soon as they entered the refugee camp and were beaten to death on the spot. Zhu Mingxia instructed soldiers not to block, letting refugees vent to their hearts' content, fully embodying the glorious image of the Senate making decisions for the people.

Zhu Mingxia instructed to separate seven or eight of higher status or trusted aides of main rebel generals, asking them to take a few words to Li Jiucheng, Kong Youde, and others. Then he handed over four hundred combat soldier prisoners to them, letting them take them back to Dengzhou.

The officers originally thought they would definitely be beheaded this time. Hearing they were allowed to return to Dengzhou and could take back four hundred combat soldiers, everyone was moved to tears. Just about to be pushed out, someone suddenly stood up and clasped hands in salute:

"Master's benevolence and righteousness, this general will never forget! I also ask Master to bestow General Mao's corpse and head back. Marshals Li and Kong will also feel Master's benevolence and righteousness when they know..."

"You people raised troops to invade without cause. My not going to punitive expedition against Huang County and Dengzhou now is already mercy." Zhu Mingxia sneered, "Still want corpse and head? Better think about your own heads first."

Several people trembled all over, looking at this officer asking for Mao Chenglu's corpse with resentful eyes. Fortunately, the other party didn't say much and directly waved hands for them to withdraw.

Zhu Mingxia instructed to load the remaining dozen officer prisoners and a large number of heads treated with lime, together with rebel banners and documents, onto a ship. Lu Yang would send people to deliver them to Laizhou for Sun Yuanhua. Bring a little fresh stimulation to the dispirited Laizhou City.

Zhu Mingxia estimated that after this big battle, Li Jiucheng and Kong Youde had only two choices: either raise a large army to come out in full strength to flatten Qimu Island in one stroke, or hold their noses and acknowledge the freedom of movement of the Northbound Detachment in Huang County and other places. Even proceed to choose to cooperate with them.

Zhu Mingxia thought the first possibility was not too great. At their peak, Dengzhou rebels, including Dongjiang veterans who crossed the sea and coerced able-bodied men, were no more than ninety thousand. Now they had at most thirty or forty thousand, among whom those with real combat power were mainly original Dongjiang Liaodong men and remnants of Shangdong and Southern soldiers who surrendered to them; these troops would not exceed ten thousand.

The troops Mao Chenglu brought were already quite tough in terms of the rebels' true strength. If even these people were defeated utterly, Li Jiucheng and others would never attack with the whole army in a fevered head—doing so, even if they could take Qimu Island, would greatly damage the rebels' vitality. Without the court sending troops, they would be cleaned up by Sun Yuanhua.

This obviously did not conform to the rebels' interests. Furthermore, their primary task was to capture Laizhou and expand maneuvering space, not to fight to the death here.

Dengzhou rebels, in the final analysis, had no real strategic goals. What they sought was nothing but immediate interests, and it was impossible to have too long-term plans. Subordinates also had different minds. So they were unlikely to fight to the death with the Northbound Detachment. There was room for coexistence between the two sides.

"Humph, let me see if you dare not agree to my conditions." Zhu Mingxia was very proud. Besides capturing a large number of prisoners this time, he looted many horses. In this way, his scout cavalry could each be equipped with double or even triple horses. Mobility was greatly improved, and sortie frequency was also much higher.

After finishing the matters at hand, Zhu Mingxia took a bath and thought of Ruhua. Immediately he instructed people to go to the Z Camp to bring Ruhua and others.

Zhu Mingxia saw that Ruhua had bathed, rested for several days, and received enough rations; her color had recovered a lot.

By the standards at that time, Ruhua could hardly be called a beauty embryo; her height, body shape, and pair of big feet did not conform to the popular aesthetic taste at that time. However, in Zhu Mingxia's view, Ruhua's level was enough to score 85. Especially her figure, very much like a female student he drooled over back then.

He felt his vision was even more brilliant. To be prudent, he decided to ask about her life experience and background first:

Ruhua's life experience was not particularly rare in late Ming society—it couldn't even be called miserable; this was just a small microcosm of many ordinary people struggling in troubled times.

Ruhua was born in a small village at the foot of a mountain in Northern Jiangsu. She was the eldest in the family. Her father was a local hunter. The family didn't have much land, but her father was skilled in hunting, and the family lived okay relying on the furs hunted. Probably because she ate more meat of various kinds since childhood, at twelve years old, she was taller than average girls.

Last year, bandits caused trouble near her hometown. The county yamen organized village braves to suppress them. Because her father could draw a bow and shoot arrows, he was recruited to suppress bandits. A few days later, the bandits were suppressed. Her father returned home with an arrow wound. Soon he developed a high fever and remained unconscious. Her mother sold all family belongings but failed to cure her father, instead owing a large debt. She had no choice but to sell her to a big household in the neighboring village as a domestic slave. This big household didn't know why they took a fancy to this big-footed woman and wanted to take her as a concubine. Originally intending to do the deed on an auspicious day, the auspicious day had not arrived when this big household drowned in a river while playing. The big household's first wife decided she was a venomous woman who cursed her husband, beat her half to death, and threw her out of the house. she wandered outside for months and was finally taken in by Liu. Because she was too old to bind her feet again, she took the name Ruhua, specializing in learning Pipa to match Siyu's singing voice.

When Ruhua finished telling her experience, snowflakes rose in the sky again. Zhu Mingxia walked outside the house and watched the drifting snowflakes for a while, turned his head to Ruhua and said: "The name Ruhua is too ugly. You are not allowed to use this name in the future. Hmm, 'Frogs croak for a thousand *li* in distinct summer (*ming xia*), snow drifts for ten thousand *li* in quiet cold (*jing han*)', you will be called Jinghan in the future. Tell your troupe leader that you have all been bought by the Senate. Go sign the indenture contract."

Zhu Mingxia required Jinghan to keep her original surname, changing Ruhua to Zhao Jinghan. After Zhao Jinghan left, Zhu Mingxia called a messenger and gave him a few instructions.
