# Chapter 698 - Raising the Flag

"Wait until we get to Hong Kong Island to properly purify them." The fleet had brought along professionals who previously worked in the Guangzhou purification camps. The Task Force planned to open a new purification camp on Hong Kong Island to process captives.

"They'll take the opportunity to escape."

"I think not—not anyone who's seen the 'typewriter' fire."

The fleet smoothly passed the Ma Wan Channel, rounding the southwest corner of Tsing Yi Island. This was Victoria Harbour. Even without binoculars, Chen Haiyang could see a peninsula jutting from the mainland—this was the site of the former timeline's Stonecutters Island Naval Base.

"Truly a natural harbor!" Chen Haiyang exclaimed involuntarily. Victoria Harbour's geographical conditions were indeed superb, perfectly suited to be a first-class naval and commercial port. Suitable port locations were everywhere.

Now it was barren, with few traces of permanent inhabitants. According to intelligence from the Guangzhou Station, only a very small number of villages existed on Hong Kong Island and the surrounding outlying islands.

But directly opposite Hong Kong Island lay Xin'an and Dongguan counties, both Guangdong's lands of fish and rice, producing vast quantities of rice, tea, indigo, tobacco, and sea salt. Economically, this was an extremely wealthy region. occupying Hong Kong was tantamount to the Australian-Song regime inserting a straw into South China's richest region. Massive amounts of goods could be continuously transported out from here.

The Ming government also recognized Hong Kong's importance. Besides the Tuen Mun Inspection Station guarding the Pearl River Estuary, Xin'an County, responsible for governing the Hong Kong region, had its county seat at the Dongguan Defense Battalion Walled City, originally under the Guangzhou Guard. in the first year of the Wanli reign, to consolidate maritime defense and protect Guangzhou, this area was separated from Dongguan to establish Xin'an County.

At its peak, Nantou Fortress here garrisoned 2,000 Ming troops and over a hundred warships. The city was a key junction for river and sea traffic, a military stronghold for maritime defense.

Even now, it maintained a garrison of seven or eight hundred troops and over fifty warships. This Nantou Fortress was present-day Nantou District in Shenzhen; there was even a tourist spot there—Chen Haiyang had visited the Ancient City of Xin'an in the past. The two locations were not far apart; if the Ming army wanted to intervene, they could reach Hong Kong Island the same day.

The External Intelligence Bureau and the Naval Command staff team estimated that the Guangdong Ming army, freshly defeated, was unlikely to rashly launch an attack on the Australian-Song army. Even if they wanted to attack, they couldn't assemble enough troops to pose a threat. The Task Force had sufficient strength to repel the Ming army.

Chen Haiyang ordered the fleet to sail toward Wan Chai, preparing to land near the Hong Kong-Macau Ferry Terminal of the old timeline and establish the first base. Although Hong Kong Island was China's 17th largest island by area, its terrain was dominated by mountains. The limited plains were mainly concentrated in the northern part of the island facing Victoria Harbour. Therefore, this was chosen as the main location for building the base and settlement area.

After the Task Force landed at Wan Chai, a brief occupation and flag-raising ceremony was held.

"Raise the flag! Salute!" With the shout of the ceremonial guard, the bugler blew the bugle. A flag rose on a temporarily procured bamboo pole. The Marines and sailors lined up on the beach saluted simultaneously, then sang "Ode to the Motherland" in unison. The occupation of the first territory outside Hainan Island by the transmigrators was declared complete.

Although they had landed on Hong Kong Island, Chen Haiyang decided not to exercise substantive control over the entire Hong Kong Island area for the time being—his troop strength couldn't support scattered deployments. Thus, he decided the main force would temporarily concentrate where the ships were anchored. In the old timeline, this place was called Central. Chen Haiyang simply named this harbor and the fortress under construction "Base 852." As for what it would ultimately be called, let the people of the Yuan Laoyuan figure it out.

To monitor surrounding activities, Chen Haiyang dispatched a small detachment with radios by boat to Lei Yue Mun to establish an observation post on this key channel east of Hong Kong Island. He sent another small team to Kap Shui Mun to establish a western observation post. These two observation posts could roughly monitor ship movements in the waterways east and west of Hong Kong Island.

The armed survey team commanded by Yellow Claws set out for Victoria Peak the day after the landing. They would conduct a preliminary survey of Hong Kong Island's general topography and terrain. Simultaneously, they would establish an observation post atop Victoria Peak.

Finally, the patrol boat squadron would form a maritime patrol line to ensure early warning around the entire base. At the same time, they would clear out small groups of pirates operating locally—Lantau Island had historically been a traditional anchorage for pirates in the Pearl River Estuary, where assembled pirate bands sometimes numbered over 300 ships. Although the Task Force hadn't observed many ships when passing north of Lantau, it was undeniable that this was the area with the most rampant pirate activity. The Task Force had to be ready for conflict with local pirates at any time.

The Task Force's landing and fortification on Hong Kong Island was quickly discovered by Ming troops stationed at Tuen Mun and Nantou. Dispatch reports were transmitted to Zhaoqing and Guangzhou.

But the Ming army was powerless to make a substantive response. Morale in official circles and the military had hit rock bottom. Although according to the dispatch reports, the bald bandits landing on Hong Kong Island numbered only about a thousand with forty or fifty ships, the officers and soldiers of the Guangdong Navy, having heard of their fearsome firearms, had no desire to fight them. Navy war junks sent from Tuen Mun only made a symbolic appearance at the Sulphur Channel before retreating. Both sides fell into a silent stalemate. As for the Ming troops in Nantou, there was no sign of large-scale movement. Only sentries observed small numbers of Ming scouts arriving in the Sha Tau Kok area across the bay.

A simple interrogation of the captured pirates revealed they were actually fishermen from nearby islands. Because they owed debts to the fish markets (yulan) and were forced beyond endurance, they finally decided to pull a job at sea.

The sunk boat belonged to the gang's boss, a fisherman named Zhao Yajin. The other two captured boats generally were coastal cargo vessels they had robbed over past month. Before being caught, they had succeeded several times, each man sharing about ten taels of silver.

The cargo vessels' crew and owners were still detained on board—it was said they had to participate during combat, or their heads would be chopped off. There were also seven or eight pirates who were kidnapped from shore when the pirate ship docked and couldn't escape in time. those with money for ransom were released; those without were kept on board and coerced into piracy.

Chen Haiyang immediately ordered the captured hostages and their ships released on the spot, even replenishing them with some captured grain and money so they could return home safely. The twenty-plus captives left with profuse thanks. Those remaining were the screened pirates. Zhao Yajin had already been killed by "typewriter" fire during the battle.

No valuable spoils were found on the ships, mostly daily necessities like grain and salted fish. According to the captured second-in-command Liang Sanshi, any valuable loot was in the villages on shore.

"The interest at the fish market is truly too heavy, charging thirty or forty percent interest. This lowly one couldn't pay it off after years of repayment, that's why I took this desperate risk. I beg the Vice-Commander to spare my life!" Several ragged men pleaded bitterly on the beach.

"Whether becoming pirates or bandits, they always say they were forced. In reality, most are lazy and seek to gain without labor!" The Cantonese translator, a scholar of *tongsheng* rank recently out of a purification camp, said indignantly to Chen Haiyang. "Chief, please be aware!"

Seeing the interpreter speaking unkindly, the captured pirates kowtowed repeatedly, begging piteously. The reputation of the bald bandits had spread to the Pearl River Estuary area. Just seeing their hair, they knew they had fallen into bald bandit hands—and their "cruelty" was notorious.

Chen Haiyang knew a bit about the heavy exploitation of fish markets. Back when he was in the fleet, although "recalling bitterness and savoring sweetness" was no longer in vogue, whenever visiting revolutionary tradition education bases, anything involving militia usually touched upon terms like "fish markets" and "fishing despots."

Fish market owners leveraged their capital and market dominance to buy catches at low prices and sell daily necessities and grain at high prices, profiting enormously. They also used high-interest loans to easily control fishermen. Fishermen often need large one-time capital investments for production and operations, creating a much higher demand for loans than farmers, making them easier prey for such usury traps.

However, Chen Haiyang's mission wasn't to strike down fishing despots. He decided to hand this matter over to the Civil Affairs Commissioner accompanying the team.

"Let them work hard in the purification camp first, and have someone interrogate them properly later." Chen Haiyang said.

Many messengers capable of speaking the local dialect were dispatched from the accompanying Civil Affairs team. escorted by armed soldiers, they went to villages across Hong Kong Island to deliver messages—demanding they immediately send representatives to Base 852 for a meeting to select liaison officers.

Although limited in strength and unable to forcefully intervene in the local civil administration system yet, the Task Force needed to establish a system for local requisition of personnel and materials as soon as possible.

"To enter and leave the Pearl River Estuary as we please, we must firmly control the Lantau Channel." In the temporary headquarters set up in a large tent, Chen Haiyang lectured his subordinates on the upcoming battle plan. "On the north side of Lantau Island, there is a village called Tung Chung. It is the main anchorage for pirates in the Pearl River Estuary. We must destroy the pirate base at Tung Chung."

Wen Desi said: "We haven't started fighting the Ming army yet, but we're starting a big fight with pirates first. Will we face enemies on both sides?"

"The Ming army may not actively fight us, but pirates who jump at any benefit are a major hidden danger for us—in the future, many ships will travel between Hong Kong Island and Lingao. Their harassment would be a major headache for the Navy."

"Then we'll need to increase land forces. occupying Tung Chung requires sending troops to garrison it!"

"It doesn't matter if we don't occupy Tung Chung for now. As long as we can destroy pirate fleets assembling there at any time, pirates will naturally dare not show their faces there."

*Note: Lantau Island is the site of Hong Kong Disneyland. The Ma Wan mentioned in the text is now connected by the famous nearby Tsing Ma Bridge. Lantau was always a Chinese pirate anchorage during the Ming and Qing dynasties. East India Company business records mention it often; in the early 19th century, Russian envoys passing through saw over three hundred Chinese pirate ships anchored there.*
