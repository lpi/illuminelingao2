# Chapter 337 - Students

Apart from a few glassware instruments, furniture, and some simple equipment that were self-made, most items in the various laboratories were products from the other timeline. Especially items like balances and microscopes, which absolutely belonged to First-Class Controlled Items in the Planning Committee's catalog. It seemed the Executive Committee was extremely determined in its investment in education.

"It takes a hundred years to cultivate people; it seems President Wen and Lord Ma really have foresight." Xiao Zishan offered a compliment. Such behind-the-back compliments were much more useful than face-to-face ones.

"I was also startled when I saw the design plan. Really generous." Hu Qingbai said, "But I'm also worried. Chemical laboratories need many chemical reagents and such; I wonder if they can be solved?"

"In a few days, the Bopu Chemical Plant will ignite. Once the 'Three Acids and Two Bases' are solved, there's nothing to worry about—at most organic chemistry can't be done."

Coming out of the laboratory, they visited the dormitories, toilets, and bathrooms. These basic living facilities were what Xiao Zishan paid considerable attention to—schools were high-density population concentration areas; if hygiene wasn't done well, just a flu outbreak among students would be enough to suffer.

Lingao Construction Company now had enough experience in constructing such high-density residential areas; the Bauhaus style was utilized to the extreme. Water supply, bathing, waste disposal, sewage—all these were solved one by one under the painstaking efforts of everyone in the Construction Company.

To reduce the volume of personnel in each dormitory and save land and building materials, Mei Wan reconstructed the dormitories, expanding the original single-story dorms to two stories, increasing the floor area ratio.

In this way, the capacity of each room in the dormitory was reduced from the original one hundred people to thirty people per room—exactly the quota for each class in the plan. According to Hu Qingbai's experience, if a class exceeded twenty people, it would be difficult for the teacher to take care of everyone. Thirty people was just barely manageable.

Letting students of one class live together, thoroughly implementing eating together, living together, learning together, and working together, would make them very united in whatever they did, helping to cultivate students' sense of collective honor and discipline.

Xiao Zishan was astonished by the neatness and high degree of discipline of the entire dormitory. At the door of every dormitory building, there were male and female students wearing "On Duty" armbands. As soon as they entered, loud commands of "Officer Inspection" would ring out in one sleeping room after another. Walking into any room randomly, students were already standing straight by their beds. Personal items and clothing were all placed in position neatly, completely a military camp style, with girls' dorms being no exception.

"Discipline is very good!" Even a military-blind and STEM-blind person like Xiao Zishan knew that high discipline of the masses had immense benefits for the superiors: fearless armies and industrial workers capable of enduring high-intensity monotonous labor.

"This is the effect of the Quarantine Camp's military training," Bai Yu said. "Even the most prickly characters have been tamed into submission. In addition, we also promote a student self-management system."

Each class was divided into groups of ten, with group leaders. Class cadres included a monitor and three class committee members responsible for studies, culture/sports, and daily life respectively.

"We require teachers only to assign tasks, not to handle arrangements specifically. Let them self-manage as much as possible." Hu Qingbai introduced, "Currently it's in dormitory management, including hygiene and security. In the future, we prepare to let classes take turns helping in the kitchen, managing the campus environment, and organizing study mutual aid groups, achieving the goals of student 'self-governance', 'self-support', and 'self-study'."

"Is the effect good?"

"Temporarily not ideal enough." Hu Qingbai said, "This transformation of thinking mode doesn't happen overnight. Students either don't know what to do without teachers' orders; or the opposite: simply acting as 'Class Tyrants'. Yesterday we handled one from the Vocational School—this kid even argued plausibly that this was 'self-management'—students in the class broke his rules as the 'Student Official', so he, the 'Student Official', had to punish them—'Officials beating commoners', you know."

"Quite an interesting kid, an official-fanatic! How was he handled?"

"Sent to the Labor Reform Team along with his subordinate class committee members. They beat a classmate into a fracture together and injured several others." Hu Qingbai sighed, "If this kid isn't locked up, he'll be a careerist in the future."

"Careerist?"

" The General Bureau of Political Security forwarded a document: some students reported that this person often said the room was full of fragrance when he was born, and his mother dreamed of a big snake entering her bosom when pregnant; fortune tellers said he was endowed with extraordinary talents and would have great wealth and honor hard for ordinary people to have, and such bullshit. Later when he was questioned, he admitted it himself and insisted it was true..."

"Isn't this mental illness? Cliché old stories." Xiao Zishan joked, "But quite imaginative. If things go wrong, he might be a local emperor or something in the future."

"He doesn't have this chance anymore." Hu Qingbai said, "The General Bureau of Political Security's sentence for this kid is 'Indefinite Labor Reform, not to be released without approval'."

"So severe!" Xiao Zishan felt a chill on the back of his neck. "A thirteen or fourteen-year-old brat, knowing what? A bit excessive, right?"

"If he didn't say those silly words about fragrance filling the room, it wouldn't be a big deal. He said it, and insisted it was true. This stepped on the high-voltage line; whoever touches it dies."

Although Xiao Zishan felt the handling of this matter was a bit excessive, essentially he didn't like this kind of low-level playing god and ghost trick either. Let this unlucky child pay the price for his delusional extraordinary endowments.

Coming out after a tour of the dormitory, Hu Qingbai invited him to sit in the office. The Education Committee's office very much fit the image of an educational institution, a two-story pseudo-European building. Because the Education Committee and the school were actually one team now, this office building also included teachers' offices. But inside it was empty; few people could be seen.

Hu Qingbai invited him into his own office. It was empty inside, with only two facing desks and a few rattan chairs.

"Didn't even apply for electric lights!" Hu Qingbai poured out bitter water (complained), "Chang Kaishen insisted this place isn't within their wire-laying range!"

"There is a shortage of teachers now! Few transmigrators are willing to be full-time teachers. And I have no personnel power. Begging everywhere, and there are only twelve people in the Ministry of Education so far. These twelve people also have to be responsible for literacy education in the quarantine camp. Busy to death." Hu Qingbai complained, "Everyone feels being a 'King of Children' is boring. Quite a few are willing to do part-time, but part-timers have limited time; we can't open night schools for everything!"

"Speaking of teachers, aren't there a few scholars among the refugees recruited from Guangzhou? Train them to take posts first."

"Few, really very few. Knowing a few characters counts as amazing. Even if there are a few intellectuals, they get intercepted by various departments as soon as they come out of the quarantine camp."

"I'll talk to the Executive Committee. Besides letting the Ministry of Education prioritize extracting indigenous intellectuals, let's look at women; suitable ones will be transferred to you." Xiao Zishan said, "Among them, many studied pure liberal arts. Staying in various departments, they are just material for being little secretaries, which is pure waste. Fang Yijing, who manages dorms for the General Office—now the dormitory occupancy rate is much lower, no need for this full-time dorm administrator anymore. Might as well transfer her to the school. To be your Matron Teacher."

"That would be great. With women, I estimate we can attract a batch of liberal arts otaku men to be teachers." Hu Qingbai seemed to see hope.

"They all have boyfriends and husbands; you have to keep a close watch, don't let scandals happen." Xiao Zishan rolled his eyes, "Actually, there is a way to attract otakus to you."

"What way?" Hu Qingbai's eyes widened.

"Stupid, what do you have most here?"

"Students—"

"Aren't there female students..." Xiao Zishan said meaningfully.

Hu Qingbai suddenly realized: "Right, right!" Then he frowned again, "They are all little kids, dirty-faced, thin as monkeys, unless they are loli lovers."

"Didn't the Superintendent want you to run a Simplified Normal School? You just extract girls aged over fifteen with decent looks and start a Simplified Normal Class. Give them slightly better food, raise them to be strong and fair..." Finally, he added, "The sailor suits female students wear are made too tackily—the material isn't good either. The tailoring technology of the Commune's garment factory is much better now, and good fabrics can also be purchased from Guangzhou and Macau. You just ask any anime otaku to contribute his *Japanese High School Girl Uniform Collection* for reference, and custom make a set for them—pay attention to make skirts longer. Then advertise Simplified Normal School recruiting teachers. Hehe, won't that group of otakus cry and shout to come be *Kichiku*... no, return as People's Teachers?"

"A Simplified Normal School can't recruit many students. One hundred is about enough. Can there be so many classes?"

Bai Yu said from the side: "Only promised to let them teach Simplified Normal School classes, didn't say only teach Simplified Normal School classes."

"Right. Isn't teaching one period a week teaching?" Xiao Zishan said with a smile. "Also, recruiting only one hundred for Simplified Normal School is too few. Try to recruit more—five hundred. Fix the literacy teachers with the lowest requirements first; otherwise, you'll be tripped up by low-level teaching and won't have time for administration."

"Recruiting all females might not be suitable." Bai Yu said, "This is the 17th century; there's no gender equality yet. You let a little girl teach big men literacy; will people submit?"

"Laboring people still submit to cultured people, regardless of male or female, or status." Xiao Zishan said. This was probably one of the traditional virtues in past Chinese society.

"But what Bai Yu said makes sense. Recruit some boys too."

Thereupon it was finalized that the first batch of the Simplified Normal School would recruit five hundred people, three hundred fifty females and one hundred fifty males. Recruited from teenagers aged fifteen to twenty who completed literacy education and obtained a Type C Diploma. The Ministry of Education would concentrate most teachers to conduct a three-month crash training for Simplified Normal School students, bringing them to the cultural level of a Type A Diploma.
