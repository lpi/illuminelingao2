# Chapter 1845 - The Tea House Boss's Worries

Zhang Yu ate a Fun Guo (dumpling), saying slowly:

"Let's count the courts established in Guangzhou," Zhang Yu said while eating, "Those that unified China, naturally there were none; even the ****** [Note: likely referencing Southern Ming or similar regimes, text blocked] content with retaining sovereignty over a part of the country in Jiangnan didn't exist. At best, they were vassal towns partitioning a corner. The Kingdom of Nanyue lasted only one hundred years, Southern Han enjoyed the state for more than fifty years, each generation worse than the last. This talk of Guangzhou having a dragon vein, I see is unreliable." After saying this, he patted his belly and spoke slowly.

After he finished these words, someone among the tea guests immediately raised a thumb: "Little Brother Zhang is truly full of learning!"

"Where, where," Zhang Yu was modest verbally, but couldn't hide the pride on his face, "Just a little insight from reading history." Remembering the spirit conveyed at the public opinion staff meeting, he added: "Actually, this superficial knowledge can be found by reading a few basic Australian magazines. Compared to thick history books, not only is the explanation clear and logical, but it is also thorough."

"Everyone knows Little Brother Zhang, you are deep in 'Kun'... ah 'Australian Studies'." The tea guests complimented one after another.

"If Guangzhou has no dragon vein, wouldn't the Australians conquering the world have great variables?" Someone began to worry about the future of the Great Song.

"The Australians' dragon vein is naturally in Australia. What does it have to do with Guangzhou?" A tea guest said, "Besides, I haven't heard of any good Fengshui in Qiongzhou Prefecture, yet the Australians prospered just the same."

"Good Fengshui? The Great Ming's Central Capital Fengyang Prefecture has good Fengshui! Produced a Zhu Emperor, resulting in common people going out to beg and flee famine!" A tea guest who was a tea merchant, traveled north and south, and was knowledgeable said.

Hearing these words were on the right track, Zhang Yu quickly said: "Correct, since ancient times, those who take the world rely on nothing more than the two words 'Popular Sentiment' (Hearts of the People)."

Everyone nodded in agreement. That tea guest was still intent on speaking and sighed with emotion: "Traveling north and south these years, I see only our Guangdong and Jiangnan count as paradises. Other places unexpectedly all have signs of the end times!"

"Speaking of which, Guangzhou really is a treasured place of Fengshui! Hahaha."

...

Seeing the preaching was about done and having other matters himself, Zhang Yu rose to take his leave. Walking only a few steps away from the seat, the tea house boss waved to him again.

This tea house boss was an old acquaintance of Zhang Yu. It was he who "discovered" Zhang Yu back then, letting him read all kinds of messy "Australian pamphlets" to tea guests in the tea house, attracting a lot of business. It also gave this small tea house quite a reputation.

But at that time, Zhang Yu was the one "receiving grace," now it was completely different. The boss looked at the young man in front of him with complex emotions. Not only had he grown much taller, but his charm and manner were also different from the past. His gestures and expressions solemnly had the flavor of a "big shot."

"This Bone-Melting Dragon (Huagulong - brat/kid), truly runs **** luck!" The boss thought, somehow hooking up with the Australians! The Australians were also truly sick! Spending money to support such a small tea food shop! Now the Zhang Family Tea Food Shop not only had booming business but also built a large workshop, specifically supplying goods to the Australians. Incoming materials and outgoing goods used big ships—solemnly becoming the number one big tea food shop in Guangzhou city. Even if he wanted to buy their goods, he had to sign a purchase and sales contract in advance, stating the monthly usage and paying a deposit first, otherwise don't even think about getting goods—this style, which tea food shop had it in the past?

"Come, come, come here." The boss greeted him towards a private room. Zhang Yu said busily: "I still have things to do, the family is busy."

"Won't take long. I have a matter here, undecided for a long time. You are familiar with the Australians, can you give me an idea?"

This couldn't be ignored. After all, this tea house boss could be considered to have shown him "recognition and kindness" back then. So he said straightforwardly: "I dare not say giving an idea. As long as you trust me, planning for you is still possible."

"Presumably Ayu also knows, the Australians are issuing new currency. Restricted to..." The boss glanced outside, confirming the waiters were doing their duties and tea guests were talking loudly, before lowering his voice, "Exchanging silver for silver dollars, this is nothing. The Red Hairs and Franks also use silver dollars. It's just this Silver Dollar Certificate and Subsidiary Coin Certificate... I really can't rest assured. Isn't this just the Great Ming Treasure Note (Baochao) old people talked about!"

Just a month ago, on June 1st, the Ministry of Finance and Economics officially started issuing new currency in the Guangdong Region. Because a briefing had been held in the business community beforehand, and the exchange was silver for silver coins—except for paying different handling fees and production costs according to purity during exchange, everyone took out silver and got back silver, so there was no feeling of loss. Aside from deducting some "premium/discount" due to purity issues, it wasn't much burden for merchants and commoners. Moreover, in the past, purity varied and weight differed. Now the large and small silver coins exchanged back were not only uniform in purity and size but also lacked not a single bit in weight. There was also no worry about fake silver. It could be called convenient for both public and private, so the silver coin exchange work didn't encounter much resistance and was even very enthusiastic.

However, with the advancement of the exchange work, comprehensive collection of copper coins began, and subsidiary coin certificates and half-yuan, two-jiao silver coin circulation certificates began to appear on the market. This immediately caused worry among the broad citizens, especially small and medium merchants.

For small merchants like the tea house boss, this was a matter of life and death. Small merchants like them mainly dealt with small-denomination currency in daily business life. Although there was no lack of generous spenders among guests coming for tea, the consumption of most guests was only a few hundred wen to one or two mace of silver. And when he went out to buy ingredients, the transaction volume was also very small. Except for a small amount of bulk goods usage, fresh ingredients were bought daily in retail, using mainly small-denomination currency.

Before Guangzhou was recovered, he used copper coins of varying quality. Because local copper coins were insufficient, he also used a kind of small silver bean privately cast by merchants and big households. The weight varied, and purity could only be looked at roughly; quality couldn't be haggled over—after all, this thing was really too small. Fortunately, it touched the word "silver." As long as the purity wasn't messy beyond redemption, it could always be spent, though it took some tongue-wagging. Because small currency was insufficient, when necessary, he even issued "tea chips" himself, used to give change to old customers and purchase goods from familiar merchants. Naturally, this also took some tongue-wagging and some favor-currying.

Speaking of Australians casting new currency, he originally had no objection. Shiny big and small silver dollars felt heavy in hand and looked comfortable.

Now the Australians wanted to completely collect broken silver and copper coins, replacing them with paper subsidiary currency. This was simply a bolt from the blue for small merchants.

"...Ayu, think about it. How much cash flow does a guest of mine have here! Most are business of a few hundred wen. How many silver warning (silver coins/jiao) can be collected in a day? Needless to say, they all pay with that subsidiary coin certificate. Not to mention the Australians are going to issue silver jiao certificates again, saying they circulate equally with silver jiao. If guests take them out to pay, I can't say I won't accept them! My whole family, waiters, and apprentices work for a day, exchanging for a pile of Great Song Treasure Notes back—said to circulate equally, but they are just pieces of paper after all... This, I really can't rest assured." The boss said with an expression of "entrusting life and family property," "You are familiar with the Australians and taken care of by the Senators. Is there any reliability in this matter?"

Speaking of this, Zhang Yu himself was filled with emotions—why? Because the tea house boss's words were almost the same as what his father said.

The Zhang Family Tea Food Shop had now been reorganized into "Zhang's Food Co., Ltd." in the hands of Senator Zhang Yikun. As for the details of the reorganization, naturally no one in the Zhang family could figure it out clearly; it was all done by Zhang Yikun—anyway, one stroke couldn't write two Zhangs.

Zhang Yu's cousin was sent to "learn Australian accounting" for this reason—Zhang Family Tea Food Shop originally had no accountant—never mind the differences and similarities between Australian accounting and Great Ming accounting, the key was Australian accounting stressed "cash doesn't stay overnight, money is transferred by account."

Cash not staying overnight meant that after checking accounts every night, cash was remitted to the Zhang Company account at Delong Bank. In the past, Zhang Yu's mother personally moved the money box into the back room, closed the door to count carefully, and then categorized and stored it.

As for depositing money at the counter of a big shop to earn interest, the Zhang family had thought about it. But their shop was small with small cash flow, and a shop was a place that spent money as soon as the door opened. They couldn't save much money. Business was bad these years, subsidizing with savings every year. There was no thought for such things.

Now business was good, but money didn't enter their own door: it was sent directly to the bank. Getting back a passbook, how much money the own shop had became just a few numbers on this passbook. Invisible and untouchable. Doing small capital business, it was inevitable to panic a bit. This was secondary. Most critically, money couldn't be spent casually either!

In the past, the finances of Zhang Family Tea Food Shop were undistinguished from the family. If Zhang Yu wanted to buy a sesame seed cake, Father Zhang went to the tea house for tea and sticky rice chicken, Mother Zhang went to buy vegetables... all took money directly from the counter. Recording a stroke in the running account was considered good; forgetting it meant simply not recording. Although they roughly knew how the business status was, specific profit and loss had to wait until the three festivals, paying off accounts, collecting debts, offsetting the two, and then charging various bits and pieces of income and expenditure accounts, only then could the profit or loss figure be known. Because family and personal expenses were mixed in, the shop's actual operating situation was a muddled account.

Now it was different. The company's accounts were completely separated from family expenses. Zhang father and son, like the waiters and apprentices in the shop, received a "salary" from the shop monthly. Besides this, they couldn't spend casually from the account anymore. Most critically, all company expenses, as long as they exceeded a certain figure, had to be paid by "check." And the seller must also provide an "invoice."

This system was not only promoted in Zhang's Food Company; the Australians were forcibly promoting and implementing it throughout Guangzhou city. All commercial and handicraft enterprises above a certain scale had to switch to this financial system.

Thus, the Zhang father and son soon discovered that their family's business was getting bigger and bigger, but the clinking, shiny silver dollars seen were fewer and fewer.
