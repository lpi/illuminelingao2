# Chapter 1582 - The Long-Haired Senator in White

"This is—"

"It's the students from Fangcaodi." Lian Nishang sighed slightly as she spoke, seeming to recall her own student life. "These are all children from the selection group." Her words revealed a tone of envy.

Zhuo Yifan was secretly surprised: This Lian Nishang was always proud and arrogant. Except for the "Chiefs", almost no one was in her eyes. She treated the Imperial Court as an enemy, often speaking many treasonous and contemptuous words. To think she would have such a tone! The status of these "juvenile Fake Australians" here could be imagined!

If he could get such a "uniform", Zhou Zhongjun and the others could approach the True Australians openly. The chances of success would increase a few points.

Originally, in the past few days, Zhou Zhongjun and others had been active near the East Gate Market, firstly to familiarize themselves with the terrain, and secondly to try to buy the "uniforms" of the Bandit students.

According to the intelligence gathered by Zhuo Yifan, students were a group relatively close to the bandits among the Fake Australians, and the True Australians had less defense against them.

Unexpectedly, student uniforms were nowhere to be bought. The ready-made clothing industry in Lingao was very developed. Naturalized citizens almost all bought ready-made clothes to wear. Even among the indigenous people, because ready-made clothes fit well and were cheap, much more cost-effective than buying fabric and hiring a tailor to make them, they were also very popular.

Only this "uniform" could not be bought. The "work clothes" in the clothing store looked quite similar to the various "uniforms" of the bandits at first glance, all being button-down jackets. But in details, there were great differences, and the difference in women's clothing was even greater. The female student uniforms of Fangcaodi could not be found in the market, not even similar ones. Zhou Zhongjun inquired around and learned that these were all "publicly issued" and could not be bought outside.

Otherwise, let Zhou Zhongjun and others try to ambush a few female students...

While he was letting his imagination run wild, suddenly dense footsteps sounded behind him, coming extremely fast from far to near. In an instant, accompanied by an almost inaudible "Excuse me", a tall figure rushed towards the position where the two stood.

Zhuo Yifan almost subconsciously pushed Lian Nishang lightly to the side, and he also took a diagonal step, turning his head quickly. But this narrow place was not conducive to dodging. He only felt a cool breeze passing behind his back, and a figure bumped into him. In panic, he could only stand firm with his feet rooted. The person who was running rapidly indoors seemed very rude and did not realize that he almost collided with a woman. He just turned around and said something like "Suo-li" (Sorry), then pushed through the crowd and left. Zhuo Yifan vaguely saw that this person was a young man, quite tall, about six feet, wearing white clothes and with disheveled hair.

The Huashan Chief Disciple was confused for a moment: "Isn't the rule in Lingao strict? Everything has an order. How can they tolerate such a reckless person? It's really strange!" He was a bit indignant. It was fine to line up behind the yellow-mouthed children to enter, but he was bumped by an inexplicable person. If he hadn't practiced martial arts and had roots under his feet, he would have almost made a fool of himself in front of the female police officer Lian Nishang.

Lian Nishang exclaimed: "Ah, this is the Chief mentioned by Zuo Yami last time. It is said that he is the only man among the Chiefs who keeps long hair! Why did he run in alone? Didn't he come with the music band?"

Zhuo Yifan wondered: "Is this a True Australian? Why doesn't he shave his hair?"

"It's true that most Chiefs shave their hair, but Zuo Yami told me that there is a male Chief in the Art Troupe who has a different style of acting. His appearance and speech are very different from their Chiefs. By the way, I remember, this is Chief Dongfang of the Art Troupe. He is probably here to participate in the Cultural Festival rehearsal today. Let's go in, there will probably be a show to watch inside!"

"Oh, unexpectedly there is such a maverick Australian, it really exceeds expectations." Zhuo Yifan was immediately ecstatic. He didn't expect the Bandit to enter and exit the gymnasium so casually, and there was such an observation opportunity. He immediately followed Lian Nishang in.

Dongfang Ke, who often overslept and arrived late when working in the Finance and Economics Committee, rode his bicycle from the Bairen Dormitory Area to the gymnasium at a sprinting speed. Then, to save time, he did not go around to the small door commonly used by Senators, but forcibly passed through the large group of people at the main entrance, almost colliding with a spectator in a long gown, and finally arrived at the stage when Liu Shuixin was already sitting in front of the piano.

"Phew, overslept, sorry."

Nan Gong, standing on the conductor's podium, was not surprised at all: "You go to the side and drink some water to slow down first."

"No need, let's start directly. Go through the speed first, and then the focus is to listen to the on-site sound field and response feeling."

"Uh, I asked the strings to try just now, it's okay. Good, let's rehearse first."

"Rehearsal piece: *Good News from Lingao Reaches Li Villages*, percussion ready."

Nan Gong raised his baton. Accompanied by the long cry of the bull horn, the bell sound of the percussion cut in subsequently. The melodious and cheerful piano sound rang under the fingers of Dongfang and Liu Shuixin—currently the MIDI keyboard had not been debugged properly, so they could only use the plucked piano to guest as the keyboard temporarily—making this 20th-century main melody folk music sound with a strange mix-and-match feeling.

Offstage, Zuo Yami, who had already finished her snacks, saw her best friend's figure and hurriedly greeted them, "Come here, come here, over here!"

"So you knew this was an Art Troupe rehearsal, if I knew I would have come earlier to watch! Hehe, did you see Chief Dongfang? He just ran past me." Lian Nishang chatted with her best friend with a grin, leaving Zhuo Yifan aside.

Hero Zhuo, still in shock, appreciated the performance on stage with interest. This "Australian Music Band" was unique in both form and instruments used. The most surprising thing was that the genuine Bandits actually personally went down to the stage to be musicians, men and women playing one zither together. The Australians' style of "disregarding hierarchy and cardinal guides" gave him a good lesson again. However, this "Australian music", compared to the silk and bamboo music among the folk of Great Ming, had a different momentum. The string sounds were noisy and cutting, the bells and gongs were scattered and orderly, the temperament was in the key of *Zhenggong*, truly sonorous and enthusiastic. Zhuo Yifan had heard of that huge foreign zither, it was a product of the West, capable of playing dozens of tones. The male and female musicians cooperated skillfully. There was also a "True Bandit" on stage, also in plain clothes, dancing with a wooden stick in hand, very funny. access those musicians playing gongs and drums looked at him intently.

Suddenly, the music entered a rapid tempo, becoming increasingly high-spirited. Then the gongs and drums sounded, ending on a long note. The dancer holding the wooden stick also clenched one fist and froze his figure. Zhuo Yifan then roughly understood what he was doing.

"Wow, the Chiefs really know everything. It's amazing that the Chiefs also come to play the qin and music!" Lian Nishang was still immersed in the impactful "Aus-Song melody" and couldn't help but start to "worship" again.

"I heard from the Chief in the club that this Art Troupe has gathered all the naturalized musicians in Lingao, and Chief Dongfang, Chief Nan Gong and Chief Liu personally sit in town to play. The instruments used were also purchased from Macau. Head Chief Okamoto ran around a lot for this." Zuo Yami continued. As for the dispute over art resources among the Chiefs she overheard last time, as a police officer, she naturally had the awareness of confidentiality.

"Oh, right, I was just watching the performance! Neglected Hero Zhuo. This little woman pays her respects. What is that in the young master's hand?"

"Miss Zuo is too polite. This is Australian Pancake bought in East Gate Market. Miss can taste it." Zhuo Yifan had long abandoned the strict segregation of sexes, only seeking to win the trust of these two female police officers.

"Hehe, not for now, I have already had breakfast. Shall we go to the fighting gym over there to spar now, or listen to the Art Troupe rehearsal for a while longer? Seems there are more programs."

"Let's listen a bit more! It's really amazing!" Lian Nishang seemed to have become a loyal "fan" of the Art Troupe.

Zhuo Yifan also echoed: "That is very good. This Australian musical temperament really has a unique flavor!" Actually, he wanted to see the faces of these few True Bandits a bit more, "It's just that these few Chiefs personally playing the qin, I always feel it loses a point of dignity..."

"Hehe, don't you sons of Great Ming also practice Qin, Chess, Calligraphy and Painting? Why can't the Chiefs play the Qin?" Lian Nishang turned around to choke him, her small mouth pouting.

Young Hero Zhuo cursed inwardly: How can the refined interest of the study be compared with performing on stage for a living? But he stopped talking and didn't argue.

The orchestra on stage was changing seats and instrument arrangements. Dongfang Ke and Liu Shuixin walked down. Okamoto went up and said: "Not bad, not bad, at such a fast speed, the basic rhythm layers of the piano and percussion were not messy. Conductor Nan Gong is still good. It's just that the sound field is still thin, and the audio needs to be debugged again."

"Just about right. This piece is relatively short, and they practiced it familiarly. The next song *Colorful Clouds Chasing the Moon* has nothing to do with me. I'll go sit down below to guest as an audience member and listen to the effect." Dongfang Ke was quite surprised that Okamoto didn't pursue his lateness.

"Okay, find a seat yourself, I'll still stare here. Comrade Liu, you..."

"I'll go listen from the opposite stand!" Liu Shuixin also appeared very active. As a backbone of a song and dance troupe before the crossing, she had long been dissatisfied with just singing at the Senator Annual Meeting. After all, the stage was where an artist's passion lay.

Dongfang Ke tied his loose hair with a hair rope, unbuttoned the first button of his silk shirt, walked alone to the stand where a group of onlookers, naturalized citizens, were located. He supported himself on the railing, swung his legs over and jumped up, stood in a shadow with his arms crossed. At this time, Nan Gonghao on stage directed the folk orchestra to start playing.

Tapping the beat with his toes, Dongfang Ke's gaze did not look at the stage. He was searching for something.

"Eh, Yami, this Australian tune seems very different from before?" Lian Nishang did not understand music. In this era without transmission media, it was not easy for ordinary people to contact various kinds of music.

"I heard this during the last rehearsal too. It is said to be a folk ditty from Fujian and Guangdong re-arranged by the Australian Chiefs."

Zuo Yami, obviously under the influence of the Senate, had become a literary and artistic activist, speaking logically.

Zhuo Yifan was staring at the musician playing the Huqin. He noticed that this person obviously had a military appearance, and wondered why he came to play the fiddle. Suddenly, his hair stood on end, as if he felt something was wrong.
