# Chapter 389 - Feed

"Won't such crossbreeding cause degeneration?"

"Slightly, but not significantly. China's existing Holstein cattle are basically products of 19th-century Dutch Holstein crosses with local cows. Milk yield is decent, and they tolerate rough feed. Downside is lower butterfat content." Yang Baogui smiled. "People often say domestic milk tastes bland, not as rich as foreign milk. Besides adulteration, this is a factor."

"With many dairy cows, we could implement a 'student milk' program—greatly improving next-generation physical fitness! At minimum, every transmigrator could have daily milk."

"Actually I think dairy products like cheese have more potential." Yang Baogui said. "Chinese don't tolerate lactose well, but dairy products are fine. Plus dairy products store easily—our harsh conditions make fresh milk preservation impractical."

They continued past several cow stalls. Besides those carrying dairy calves, various other breeds had been served. The liquid nitrogen tanks' different bull semen types had all been matched with local cows—some purely for meat, some dual-purpose.

After cattle sheds came the sheep pen. The enclosure had few sheep—just several dozen. These had recently arrived from Changhua Fortress—Changhua sheep. They didn't seem well-adapted to penned life; occasionally rams tried ramming the fencing.

These sheep would be raised for a period, then quality ewes selected for artificial insemination. The Agricultural Committee had several quality goat and sheep semen types. But whether sheep suited Lingao—Yang Baogui really wasn't confident. Better to occupy higher-latitude regions first before breeding.

Nearby sheepdogs ran out, barking loudly, restoring flock order.

"Beibei, stop barking!" Yang Baogui called. Immediately a pack of dogs ran over, wagging tails furiously—some were puppies.

"Look—'Huanhuan,' 'Yingying,' 'Nini' are all hero mothers. Just half a year and over twenty puppies born." Seeing Wu Nanhai pick up one adoringly: "I'll give you one."

"No thanks—dog-keeping gives bad impressions." Wu Nanhai reluctantly set it down.

"True—several girls have asked me for dogs; I haven't given any." Yang Baogui said. "Need to train them properly first, then assign to departments. Ma Qianzhu wants a military dog unit; Security Bureau also wants some."

"A dog at the gate for guarding would be reassuring." Wu Nanhai thought. "Are there local mongrels? Maybe I'll just catch one for guarding."

"Of course. I've caught a few, seeing if we can develop localized hybrids. These are typical Chinese pastoral dogs—low domestication level. Probably more likely to be beaten and eaten as meat dogs. Cats are better." Yang Baogui said. "Though cats and dogs don't directly produce economic value, they greatly help agricultural production. Once the sheep flock expands more, I'll arrange grazing—that'll need dogs' help."

Yang Baogui proposed: besides poultry, sheep promotion would also be a good item. Sheep tolerated rough feed, were simple to care for, needed no special feed, and required little labor. Women and children could herd them—the most common poverty-alleviation project.

Wu Nanhai shook his head: "Sheep cause too much vegetation damage."

"That's in semi-arid northwestern regions. Here with abundant rain and rich surface vegetation, a few sheep won't damage anything. Besides, one farm household can at most raise a dozen sheep—low land carrying capacity."

Wu Nanhai was tempted: "Wait until this chicken promotion succeeds. Only responsible farmers should get them—eating 10 chickens is manageable to resolve; eating our sheep is harder. Pursue them and they go bankrupt; don't pursue, and future programs fail."

The livestock farm's final section was rabbits. Rabbits had initially been unhappy living here—too hot. The entire farm's best-cooled livestock housing was the rabbit building—directly under big trees—but rabbits remained listless, refusing to breed. This troubled Yang Baogui—did they need air conditioning? By deep autumn in Lingao, they finally felt romantic. Rabbit reproduction rates were phenomenal—could mate anytime, gestation just one month, mature rabbits producing 6-10 per litter. 20th-century Australia's rabbit plague—despite government and farmer culling—was merely descendants of five pairs of European rabbits over 100 years.

Rabbits were herbivores with low feed requirements—very suitable as rapid meat providers.

Now this once-expanded rabbit building held over 30 rabbits, including 10 Angora rabbits—Wu Nanhai recognized them immediately. To help Angoras survive summer, these rabbits had been completely sheared.

"Summer rabbits don't breed—wait for autumn." Yang Baogui said. "By year's end we should be able to feed everyone rabbit meat. Health Department also needs rabbits."

"Let Health Department dissect first, then everyone eats after dissection."

"Physiological dissection is fine; pathology experiments can't be eaten."

"Naturally." Wu Nanhai suddenly remembered. "Lingao has wild rabbits, I recall. Haven't you thought of using local wild rabbits to improve and expand the population?"

"Not very suitable. Plus wild rabbits may carry viruses—if those spread, disaster."

Finally they reached the riverside wasteland, approaching the Wenlan River's summer high-water mark. Sandy soil grew peanuts and watermelons. Farther away were several large pools connected by channels, emitting stench. Wu Nanhai knew this was Tian Jiujiu's biochemical wastewater treatment system. The livestock farm was a major wastewater producer—cage-washing generated large volumes of organic-rich wastewater. Biogas pits alone couldn't handle it, so they'd built a biological treatment system: wastewater first settled, then entered treatment ponds where aquatic plant cultivation absorbed excess nitrogen and phosphorus.

Several ponds were covered with dense duckweed. Workers were harvesting duckweed from the ponds—excellent green feed and composting material. Not far away was the livestock farm's silage pit.

"Pond duckweed is also a feed source." Yang Baogui asked Wu Nanhai seriously: "The Agricultural Committee apparently has high hopes for livestock farming. I want to know—have you considered feed? No grain means no livestock industry."

"Of course we have."

Wu Nanhai explained the feed solution, planned through three approaches.

Primary starch feed would come from expanded sweet potato cultivation—both sweet potatoes themselves and deep-processing byproducts like starch water and residue.

Second was green feed. In modern agriculture this meant corn silage. In China, because grain was precious, corn stalk silage was promoted. In Lingao, the Agricultural Committee didn't even have corn—they used alfalfa silage and other legume fodder crops, plus sweet potato leaves. Additionally, high-yield vegetables like pumpkins and squash grown on "ten-border" marginal plots could provide some feed.

Most crucial protein feed came from: first, earthworm and fly-maggot farming; second, recovering oil-pressing byproducts like soybean cake, peanut cake, coconut oil cake. Bo-pu's seafood factory could also supply some fish meal from trash fish and processing scraps.

Feed additives: calcium could be directly recovered from eggshells and bones, or limestone powder added. Salt they had plenty of; if needed, they could obtain trace element supplements from kelp and seaweed.

Agricultural processing byproducts like rice straw, rice bran, and sweet potato skins weren't ideal feed, but could supplement—especially after processing, livestock could better absorb and utilize them.

Calculated this way, feed sources were quite diverse. At current farming scale, feed scarcity wouldn't occur. According to Fa Shilu's estimates, after the second-half sweet potato harvest, feed supply would be quite ample—just in time for autumn's peak livestock birthing season.

"Last time Fa Shilu told me: think creatively, don't just focus on corn and sweet potatoes. We can obtain abundant supplements from wild plants—rural children used to gather grass to feed pigs."

"Does Lingao have such plants?"

"Of course. Common plants everywhere. Grasses like cogongrass, foxtail, medick, alkali grass, barnyard grass—all gramineous wild grasses work for pulping and silaging to feed pigs. Leguminous wild grasses go without saying—everyone knows. Wild vegetables: lamb's quarters, Russian thistle, sow thistle, purslane, wild amaranth, chicory, plantain, bedstraw—all can be fed raw or fermented. Also green tree leaves: poplar, willow, elm, mulberry. Not everywhere, but not rare either. Mobilizing students and commune semi-laborers as sideline work could gather plenty."

"Honestly, I really wanted to bring water hyacinth. That stuff—you scoop tons from waterways. During summer blooms it piles up like dams. Far more efficient than human-wave feed collection."

"That invasive species—better not. Long-term consequences are endless. Let's not repeat predecessors' mistakes. Duckweed is sufficient. We'd originally planned to bring tilapia and crayfish. Later all vetoed."

This issue had sparked fierce debate during pre-crossing material preparation. Tilapia, crayfish, and others had all been eliminated through debate. The final decision was: don't bring any controversial species—they all existed on Earth anyway. When needed someday, just cultivate locally.

"Crayfish are great. Such a pity. Everyone loves eating them."
