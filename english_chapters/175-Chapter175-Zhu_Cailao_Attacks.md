# Chapter 175: Zhu Cailao Attacks

Under Wen Desi's promise of "teaching Western big-ship secrets," Shipwright Zhang enthusiastically began rush work, selecting assistants. Wen Desi—genuinely interested in ancient shipbuilding—stayed with Li Jun's platoon to observe. The Navy showed a completely different interest: the *Fubo* visited every few days, and they shipped Navy cadets to Baitu as Zhang's short-term workers to learn firsthand shipbuilding experience. Though future shipwrights would train in Technical School, the Navy believed cultivating ship-savvy officers was necessary—if possible, future shipyards should be Navy-controlled.

Wen Desi clearly understood the Navy's scheming—but his personal preference gave him a natural Navy bias. He pretended oblivion—continuing cross-temporal technical exchanges with Shipwright Zhang.

Wen Desi discovered Zhang was a model master. Using simple woodworking tools, he crafted various ship models with accurate proportions and detachable parts. This was his technical secret: essentially the scale-up method. Primitive but effective. Wen Desi knew European shipwrights used similar methods—and that the "model-first" tradition derived therefrom.

Zhang knew little mathematics or geometry—his drafting was at a doodle level. But he memorized every ship's dimensions, structure, and specifications perfectly. Wen Desi admired this—ancient Chinese craftsmen, often illiterate and untrained in mathematics, created wondrous works through generations of accumulated experience. Truly unique.

Seeing Zhang's models made Wen Desi's hands itch. Since supervising construction was leisurely, he started building a schooner model. With a model, communication with Zhang would be easier.

As a lifelong survival prepper, tools, food, and weapons always accompanied him. Materials were convenient, so he began immediately.

Seeing a "learned person" like Wen Desi doing craftsman work amazed Zhang. In his view, educated people only wielded brushes—hands-on craft was beneath them.

After work every evening, Zhang visited Wen Desi's quarters observing Western model progress. They exchanged model-making techniques. Wen Desi seized opportunities to teach simple hull and sail design concepts.

While Wen Desi leisurely built models at Baitu, the transmigrators at Bopu and Bairren grew busier daily. Endless projects demanded materials and labor. As the Planning Committee commissioner handling daily operations, Ma Qianzhu became the busiest person: material allocation, labor coordination, inter-departmental relations. Limited resources and manpower meant endless disputes over priorities. Disputes became entangled with personal grudges formed post-D-Day. Group leader grudges evolved into inter-group conflicts. Every trivial matter sparked debates and arguments. Commissioners constantly mediated. Once, Xiao Zishan furtively approached Ma Qianzhu, suggesting the confiscation of sidearms.

"Why?" Ma Qianzhu wanted pistols distributed to everyone given the dangerous situation.

"What if arguments escalate—impulsively—" Xiao Zishan made a gun-drawing gesture.

"Impossible. Zishan—are you psychologically disturbed?" Ma Qianzhu dismissed it.

Besides daily administration, as Chief of Staff, Ma Qianzhu handled military matters.

Baitu's successful operation injected adrenaline into the group. The hand-trained New Army and hand-made weapons passed combat tests—the Industrial and Military branches were exhilarated. Decades of armchair strategizing finally won a real battle.

Ma Qianzhu wasn't as excited. Though absent from the expedition, Xi Yazhou's accounts revealed various problems. The Army wasn't as strong as people imagined. Intensified training was the only solution. Overruling the Mechanical Department's objections, he prioritized ammunition production. Lead reserves plummeted. Ji Situi warned that the Chemistry Department's saltpeter stockpile was nearly exhausted—powder production consumed vast quantities, and nitric acid production had nearly halted.

"If we're defeated—what use is surplus nitric acid?"

Ji Situi shrugged and didn't argue. Ma Qianzhu understood nitric acid's importance to modern industry—but surrounded by enemies, militarization was unavoidable.

Zhu Cailao's peace offer via Shi Shisi had produced no response. War or peace remained unclear. Ma Qianzhu doubted whether that pirate captain even delivered the message. The transmigrators knew little about maritime groups—Guangzhou intelligence was vague, leaving him confused. The only information available was the Intelligence Group's compiled historical materials on Chongzhen Year 1 (1628) maritime group movements.

Today he was on duty at the Communications Center. Amid chaotic public channel chatter, he resolved to finish this brief so he could draft operational plans substituting for the non-existent Staff Department.

As the primary enemy, Zheng Zhilong had officially accepted amnesty in July, achieving legal status to control foreign trade. His partner Li Kuiqi defected "over spoils disputes"—probably related to trade profits.

Li Kuiqi rebelled in September: "seized ships and betrayed, recruited outlaws, challenged Zhilong... December 9th, Kuiqi allied with Chen Shengyu, Zhong Liu (Zhong Bin), Zhou San and others—400+ vessels entered Old Wuyu for battle."

Li Kuiqi's rebellion strength was formidable—reportedly taking nearly all Zheng's ships and weapons—leaving Zheng "only dozens of ships, 600 men." From Li Kuiqi's rallying power—his strength rivaled Zheng. But Ma Qianzhu doubted these numbers. If he truly had "dozens of ships, 600 men"—Zheng couldn't sustain year-plus warfare against Li. Nor could he sign a trade contract with the Dutch on October 1, 1628 (9th month, 4th day) as China's largest maritime group.

For the transmigrators, the Zheng/Li conflict was advantageous. At least both forces wouldn't attack them. Whether negotiating through force or seeking peace through tribute, they only faced the Liu Xiang and Zhu Cailao groups.

This "only" still pressed heavily. Ma Qianzhu lowered the report. From start to finish, there was little about actual military strength. Historical figures were vague approximations—useless. How to respond? Understandable—military intelligence wasn't a historian's specialty. They must rely on the military's own intelligence. Building local agent networks was urgent.

Now that the Training Battalion was established, the arms industry growing, and four fishing trawlers converted—heavy projectors were replaced with 70mm breech-loaders. These trawlers gave transmigrators naval advantage—nothing in this era could challenge them. Days ago, Lin Shenhe finally produced primitive impact-fuse shells—an 80% detonation rate, quite respectable—but it required copper.

Copper sourcing was difficult. Despite Gao Ju's channel, buying copper was troublesome. Gao Ju was increasingly suspicious of their purchases: massive pig iron, saltpeter, copper—destinations unknown. Constant arrivals of various foreign goods (Gou Manor spoils)—suggesting troubling possibilities. Recently he'd probed repeatedly—the Youyu Islet transshipment warehouse had been secretly inspected.

Guo Yi recommended seizing Hong Kong Island—at minimum establishing a transit base there. Also proposing contact with Macau for Portuguese-mediated overseas trade.

Seizing Hong Kong Island. Ma Qianzhu thought: decent idea—but Hong Kong was far more sensitive than Lingao. Right under the provincial capital's nose—Pearl River mouth's strategic point. Occupation meant preparing for a major Ming army battle. Their 500–600 personnel were insufficient.

Fighting and building—truly a two-headed difficulty. Now he understood why alternate timelines often mentioned "winning time for peaceful construction"—it was truly critical. The Army and Navy were twin gold-devouring beasts—consuming resources while occupying valuable manpower.

Lost in thought, suddenly the public channel screamed: "Enemy! Enemy spotted!" The channel exploded.

Ma Qianzhu bellowed: "This is the Duty Officer and Chief of Staff! Everyone shut up! Alarm caller—identify yourself and location! Shaozhong—we need a dedicated channel! NOW!"

Switching to a private channel, the voice calmed: "I'm the Exploration Team's Liu Zheng. Departed this morning for peat search. 9 a.m.—encountered enemy 25km east of Bairren. Retreated immediately—just reached radio coverage. Enemy about 1 hour behind."

"How many? What equipment?"

"Several hundred approximately. Couldn't see equipment clearly—seem to have firearms. Some cavalry. No artillery!"

"Ming regulars or pirates?"

"No uniforms. No armor. Probably pirates!"

Damn—it seems Zhu Cailao attacked. That bastard completely ignored our olive branch!

"Return to fortress immediately! Report any changes!"
