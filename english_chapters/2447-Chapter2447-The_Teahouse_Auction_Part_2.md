# Chapter 2447: The Teahouse Auction (Part 2)

Selling night soil fertilizer naturally brought decent income, but compared to the past when he squeezed both the city dwellers and the farmers—"eating from both ends"—the income was already much reduced. Moreover, everyone said the Australians would sooner or later swallow this "fat piece of meat" themselves.

Though Boss Mi harbored resentment, he knew his head couldn't butt against the big blade. Besides, after the Australians cleared out the night soil districts, they had shown mercy by not mobilizing night soil workers to "struggle" against him—probably recognizing his "sensible" behavior in voluntarily giving up his districts.

But just because they hadn't struggled against him didn't mean there was no "black material." Every time Boss Mi thought about it, he felt thorns in his back.

Fear was fear, but life had to go on. Boss Mi had been looking for new money-making projects lately. His family had been night soil lords for generations, with at least three hundred thousand buried in the ground.

Wu Yijun could tell at a glance that today's auction would be lively. These two families might not have prominent reputations—the Mi family's was even somewhat "smelly"—but both were deep-pocketed old families. In terms of wealth, they weren't necessarily less than those high-profile households. Their situations also meant they came to this auction "determined to win."

He just didn't know which projects these two families had their eyes on. Wu Yijun thought.

Looking further ahead, there was actually another familiar face—none other than "Old Huo," official name Huo Maixiong. It was quite surprising that Old Huo would come. These past years, Old Huo had been badly hurt by the Australians. He had originally been the head of Guangzhou's paper trade, not only having multiple trading firms in the city wholesaling various paper products, but also multiple paper workshops outside the city. He could be called Guangzhou's paper industry leader.

Ever since "Australian paper" landed in the Guangzhou market, distributed by Zicheng Company, Huo Maixiong's business had plummeted. Because Australian paper was high quality and low priced, paper trade colleagues had all switched to sourcing from Zicheng Company. His business not only went into steep decline, but even the papermaking workshops closed down. If the Australians hadn't gotten involved in stationery paper yet, and he could still scrape by with paper shipped in from other places, Old Huo would have closed up shop long ago. So these past few years, whenever the Australians came up in conversation, he would curse without end, hating that "the heavenly troops couldn't annihilate them all."

The paper trade, though still existing now, had actually fallen to just a small retail business for the Australians. The Paper Trade Guild's influence in the entire Federation was negligible.

Setting aside Old Huo's past resentment toward the Australians, did he currently have the resources to bid and buy? Wu Yijun was quite puzzled. Looking at projects, he would most likely bid on his old trade: "paper factory." But the paper factory project's "project transfer fee" alone was ten thousand dollars. Once operations started, at least another ten thousand would need to be invested... Old Huo's down-at-heel appearance these past years wasn't feigned: When his father passed away, the funeral was hasty. When his youngest son married, he couldn't match with a prominent family.

Just as he was puzzling over this, in walked another master and servant through the door. The moment this pair entered, a stir went through the entire hall. Everyone present stood up to greet them. Wu Yijun focused his vision—it was Liang Chenlong.

*Now he's a rare guest!* Wu Yijun thought. Though Liang Chenlong's position as Money Trade Guild President was prestigious, his family's Maokang was just a small player in the money trade, only holding the presidency through the Liang family's backing. Now with the Australians in power, Young Master Liang's current position was delicate, the winds decidedly unfavorable. Dissenting voices in the trade were gradually growing louder too.

Could it be that Young Master Liang was also planning to please the Australians by investing in industry? Or was Liang Chenlong trying to "draw a clear line" from the Liang family? This needed careful consideration.

Watching the hall gradually fill up and time running short, Gao Ju emerged from behind a screen. Greeting everyone with cupped fist salutes as he went, he mounted the stage. On stage, he made another round of bows, greeting everyone with a beaming smile.

"Gentlemen, thanks to everyone's honor in attending this project transfer auction. This is giving Gao a great deal of face—Gao is most grateful..."

Seeing this, those below followed the Australian custom and applauded. Gao Ju continued: "The auction materials have all been reviewed by everyone—Gao won't ramble on. These are all golden egg-laying hens. The Senate releasing these projects for transfer is an immense grace. Those who win projects need no further words—manage them well for a 'win-win.' Those who don't win shouldn't be discouraged either—the Senate will have other projects in the future. Everyone should work hard to make money and prepare."

Just as he was speaking, a Senator-looking person mounted the stage escorted by several naturalized citizen cadres. This Senator was unfamiliar, but looking at his bearing, the powerful families present could all sense this one was "no ordinary person."

Indeed, when Gao Ju made the introduction, everyone learned this was a "big figure" from the Senate's central leadership: the Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries Minister Wu Nanhai.

Though everyone didn't understand why the Senator in charge of agriculture was attending the auction, they figured it was probably to show the Australians' emphasis on this matter. Indeed, this Chief Wu also began speaking, but this Chief Wu's "Newspeak" had a heavy accent. For the wealthy families whose Newspeak was already limited, it was somewhat incomprehensible. Fortunately, Wu Nanhai's speech was very brief. He soon yielded the position to a newly arrived Senator, whose appearance was quite different from typical Senators: dark skin, bald head, face full of fierce muscle—it was He Fanghui, specially sent to host this auction.

As soon as he mounted the stage, the entire auction officially commenced.

Auction items were hung on the gate-shaped frame one by one in sequence order, with introductory diagrams displayed. Then the host introduced and started bidding for each.

The auction catalog's projects were almost entirely concentrated in light industry: textiles, clothing, shoes and hats, wood processing, food processing, glass and enamelware, small hardware. Non-light-industry projects were building materials and fuel, plus agriculture-related "biofertilizer."

All projects had two options. Under the equity-share Option A, the Planning Agency would hold a certain percentage of shares in the newly established enterprise—ranging from 10% to 25%—and as an equity partner, would provide free market and technical support. Under the sole-proprietorship Option B, the Senate would hold no shares, and provided technical and market support would be charged at market rates.

"We begin with the first project: Biofertilizer!" With He Fanghui's booming voice, two teahouse workers hung up the introductory diagram for Project 1.

Biofertilizer sounded very high-tech, but essentially it was farm manure processing. Including human and animal waste harmless treatment, organic composting, and the most technologically advanced "earthworm farming deep processing technology."

As Wu Yijun expected, Boss Mi indeed bid on this project. And under Option A.

Ten thousand Australian dollars in investment plus no less than 100 standard *mu* of land—Boss Mi really was wealthy. Wu Yijun sighed. Of course, this ten thousand dollar project transfer fee wasn't given for nothing. The Australians would provide a complete set of initial startup production equipment. Looking at it that way, it wasn't a bad deal.

No one competed with him for this project; the biofertilizer project was sold at the reserve price.

Wu Nanhai watched coldly from the side. He had expected this: industrial projects were different from slave auctions—they were deals worth thousands or tens of thousands. Moreover, they involved future operations. Most attendees had carefully studied the project handbook and assessed their own capabilities, so there wasn't the kind of heated bidding seen at ordinary auctions. The true purpose of holding this auction wasn't to obtain markup premiums anyway.

Senator He, however, felt somewhat underwhelmed. He coughed and ordered the next project to be brought up.

"Project Two: Wood Processing!" He Fanghui said. "Starting price: ten thousand silver dollars! At least 100 standard *mu* of land, plus an inland river dock connected to the Pearl River."

The Pearl River Delta had no forest resources, but other areas of Guangdong had abundant forest resources, which were materials the Senate urgently needed.

Like Project 1, this project didn't attract much interest. Everyone already knew from the project handbook that this project had certain site requirements—it had to be downwind from residential areas, and the site itself needed an inland river dock. These various restrictions made its hidden costs too high.

Though response wasn't enthusiastic, quite a few people were optimistic about the timber market. Several people raised their hands simultaneously. After two rounds of bidding, it finally sold for eleven thousand five hundred dollars.

The subsequent auctions were mostly similar—either selling at reserve price or concluding after slight bidding. There were also two items with no bidders, going directly unsold. So dull that Wu Nanhai yawned, and even He Fanghui found it tedious.

Not until the seventh item—"Match Factory"—did the entire auction hall suddenly come alive.

Matches were the most popular product the Senate sold externally. Without much promotion or marketing, Lingao-produced matches had rapidly spread through natural distribution alone. Not just in Guangdong, but even in Jiangnan, the capital, all the way to Manchu-ruled Northeast, even as far as Korea, Japan, Southeast Asia, Central Asia, and Europe—this convenient fire-starting tool could be found everywhere. If a box of matches sufficient for a month's use cost just two eggs in Senate-ruled Hainan, by the time it reached distant places, the price had already exceeded ten or even dozens of times.

Due to ever-expanding demand, match production had always been in a state of supply shortage. After Planning Agency calculations, it was decided that apart from retaining one state-owned match production enterprise, all other match production capacity would be "privatized." The Senate would only control upstream match chemicals and related machinery manufacturing in the future, leaving match production to private enterprises. This would fully utilize private capital to expand production capacity while significantly reducing state enterprise labor costs.

"Our employees' training and usage costs are very high—we need to put them in positions with higher returns." Following Wu De's directive, they were preparing to release three match factory projects throughout the greater Guangzhou area.

The match factory's market prospects were crystal clear to the wealthy families. When the five-thousand-dollar Match Factory Project 1 was posted, paddles immediately shot up throughout the hall.
