# Chapter 285 Sweet Port Turbulence – Escalation

The first heart-stopping day passed like this. That night, not just Wen Tong—all the transmigrators at the South China Sugar Factory were like ants on a hot pan. Everyone realized they faced a challenge here and were in the midst of a crisis. For Wen Tong, there were now two options. First, transfer cash from Guangzhou and Lingao. With enough silver, the current crisis could immediately turn into a windfall—the South China Trading House buying sugar at the original price would not only yield huge de facto profits but would also give it immense credibility in Leizhou. But arithmetic quickly reminded him: this was impossible. Over two hundred thousand *shi* of sugar in Leizhou—even if he ultimately bought only a third, that would require nearly two hundred thousand *liang* of silver. An astronomical figure. Never mind that Lingao certainly couldn't produce that much—even Guo Yi in Guangzhou would have to bankrupt the entire Guangzhou Station to meet it.

Xiao Gui said: "Have Lingao send over a batch of luxury goods—mirrors, glassware, that sort of thing..."

"What use are those to cane farmers? Old Xiao!" Chen Tianxiong shook his head repeatedly. "If someone paid your salary with an Armani suit instead of cash, would you be willing?"

"Fair point." Xiao Gui thought that whether ancient or modern, real gold and silver were always more useful than goods.

"The second option," Wen Tong said, "is to simply cut the purchase price tomorrow. Once we cut the price, this situation will immediately improve, and we can continue normal purchasing. Of course, this means we'd lose the chance to take down Haiyi Hall's monopoly on Leizhou in one stroke. This is the safer approach, and probably the only one."

"If only Old Chang could get back soon. He'll definitely bring rice back, and if we pay for sugar with rice, the farmers should still accept it." Wen Tong sighed. But in his heart, he knew this was impossible.

"I guess that's all we can do." Everyone fell silent. That night, Wen Tong was restless and irritable. Even A-Zhu, who was preparing to offer herself as a pillow companion, was scolded and sent away.

The next day, at first light, Wen Tong hastily washed up and brought his people to the trading house entrance. The scene outside nearly stopped his breathing. A dark mass of farmers stretched from the gate all the way to the main road. There had to be several thousand people, at least—and it looked like they'd arrived overnight. Apparently, word of Haiyi Hall's price cut had already spread throughout Xuwen. Everyone who still had unsold sugar was flooding toward South China, their last hope.

Chen Tianxiong and the others arrived too. Even Xiao Gui came—no one had the heart to train apprentices now.

Liao Daxing came over and asked quietly: "Sir, should we change the price on the board?"

Wen Tong gritted his teeth and nodded: "Change it."

Liao Daxing was giving orders to a clerk to write up the new price board, ready to hang it up when they opened, when Liao Dahua came in. Seeing they were about to change the price, he quickly grabbed Liao Daxing's arm: "Don't hang it yet!" He turned to Wen Tong and said in a low voice: "Master, we can't change it!" He pulled Wen Tong into the back room of the counting house:

"The escort guards I sent out have gathered some intelligence."

"What intelligence?" Wen Tong tensed up.

"All over Hai'an Street—and in Xuwen town too—people are saying the South China Factory uses sorcery. That it produces sugar out of thin air. So now sugar from South China is everywhere, prices have dropped badly, and all sugar is unsellable..."

"Absolute rubbish!" Wen Tong was so angry he clenched his teeth. What kind of rumor was this? Despicable! Utterly despicable! "The sugar price in Guangzhou is clearly three *liang* eight *qian*! Where's this price drop?"

"Well... the farmers are ignorant, and Guangzhou is over a thousand *li* away. Nobody can verify it."

Chen Tianxiong said: "Looks like someone is exploiting this information gap."

"Enough analysis—let's make a decision!" Wen Tong's mood was growing frantic. "What do we do about the purchase price?! Do we change it or not?"

Before anyone else could speak, Liao Dahua jumped in: "We can't change it! The streets are full of talk now. People are saying the whole thing is South China's fault. If South China doesn't buy at two *liang* five *qian*, they're going to go to the authorities and say South China is under suspicion of practicing sorcery..."

"Bullshit! The county would listen to their nonsense?"

"Master, of course we're not afraid of them filing complaints at the county—it's all baseless after all. But the escort guards all say there's something very fishy going on here. There are quite a few riffraff mixed in among the sellers. With everyone already panicking, the moment South China changes its price, these people will immediately start a commotion, inciting the crowd to rush in. That would be... mutual destruction! Once trouble starts, even people from the county won't be able to suppress it immediately!"

Everyone's mind flashed to reports they'd seen on online forums about mass incidents. Back then, reading about such things had given them a certain dark satisfaction—a sense of the common people fighting back. But now, when the common people were gathered outside ready to start a mass incident against them, everyone felt the pressure intensely.

"And..." Liao Dahua added, "There are also several hundred sugar-boiling craftsmen from rustic sugar mills all over Leizhou mixed in here. Ever since the South China Factory opened, the rustic mills' business has plummeted. These craftsmen are either unemployed, or those who still have jobs have had their wages pushed way down. They're all nursing grudges. I hear that some have already submitted petitions to the yamen a few days ago, asking the government to intervene. The magistrate rejected them, but if they take advantage of this moment to make trouble, it'll be even worse. Some are even planning to rush in and destroy the machines."

"Holy shit, this is turning into the Luddite movement? The revolutionary consciousness of the masses is really high!" Mei Lin said.

"What's the point of that comment?" Wen Tong waved his hand. "We're all capitalists here. Be careful the revolutionary masses outside don't give us the dictatorship treatment. Everyone come up with ideas!"

"Let's keep buying at the original price." Xiao Gui said. "Even if no one attacks the factory, life isn't easy for the farmers anyway. As long as we make money, that's fine. If there really is an assault, the machines being destroyed would be a huge loss."

"Of course, the best strategy is to keep buying. But what about the silver?!" This was what worried Wen Tong.

"We can hold out for a few more days with the silver we have," Chen Tianxiong said. "A few more days of breathing room is good. At least we can think of countermeasures."

If they cut prices now, according to Liao Dahua's intelligence, the bomb someone had prepared for them would immediately blow the South China Factory to smithereens. If they kept buying at the original price, though they'd still face crisis after scraping by for a few more days, at least they'd have buffer time. If they could come up with a counter-strategy in time, this might even become a golden opportunity to unify the Leizhou sugar industry.

"Let's do it this way. Manager Liao, go tell them to keep buying at two *liang* five *qian*..."

Before he could finish, Wen Xiu came stumbling in: "Bad... bad news..."

"What is it?" Everyone's faces changed. Had the proletarian masses already started their assault?

"The farmers outside—I don't know who told them, but they're all saying South China is going to buy at one *liang* five *qian* today. Someone's stirring them up, saying this whole thing is South China's fault, and if South China dares to cut the price, they'll make South China pay for it..."

"Bastards!" Seeing the enemy pressing step by step, Wen Tong knew there was no time to waste. He quickly ordered Wen Xiu: "Run out and tell Liao Daxing to hang up the price board immediately. Price unchanged!"

Wen Xiu ran out. The atmosphere in the room grew even heavier. If what Liao Dahua had said earlier was just a possibility, the current situation had confirmed the accuracy of the intelligence. Chen Tianxiong suddenly said: "Something's fishy here!"

Everyone's eyes snapped toward him. Chen Tianxiong said: "We only made the decision to change the purchase price early this morning. How did the people outside find out so fast?"

"There's a spy!"

"Exactly," Chen Tianxiong said. "The root is probably those locally hired clerks. They were all recruited recently. We don't know anything about their backgrounds."

Liao Dahua said: "That's easy to handle. First, take them off their positions and have the escort guards detain them."

"But then we'll have no local clerks who can communicate with the farmers. Leizhou dialect is notoriously difficult even among Cantonese speakers."

"I'll go to Xuwen town right now and ask the shops and warehouses we know to spare one or two people each. Add in the local people from the escort agency, and that should be enough."

"Good, go quickly. Opening time is almost here!"

On one side they were rearranging the clerks; on the other side they called Zhou Shizhai over and ordered him to not only mobilize the militia but also organize all the factory's men and able-bodied women. Production was to be suspended. Everyone was to be given a club, ready to defend the factory and protect equipment and warehouses.

"Tell everyone, if trouble breaks out, just hit—hit hard! If someone gets killed, the masters will find someone to take the blame for them! Five hundred *liang* compensation for each death! Any injuries, South China will support them for life! As long as the machines and warehouses are protected, everyone gets ten *liang* of silver!"

"I'll go give the orders immediately!" Zhou Shizhai knew the stakes and hurried off to make arrangements. Xiao Gui also rushed back to the boiler room to raise the pressure—if anyone stormed the sugar factory, they could use the steam engine to power the water pump and spray the crowd.

While they were making urgent preparations inside, the crowd outside had begun to grow restless. Already distraught over the price drop, they'd now heard that their only hope—the South China Trading House—was also preparing to cut prices. And opening time had passed, but the doors were still closed. The growing unrest in the crowd began to spread. Some opportunists were shouting:

"South China doesn't dare to open!"

"They caused this mess—they have to clean it up!"

"If they won't open, we'll rush in!"

"Burn down this demon factory!"

"Everyone, charge!"

The disturbance in the crowd grew louder and louder, about to become uncontrollable, when the South China gate opened. Liao Daxing strode out with his head held high. His haughty manner as a man of status made the farmers, already agitated and ready to act, fall silent for a moment.

"What's all this noise about?" Liao Daxing maintained an air of confident arrogance, though his back was drenched in sweat. "Come on, hang up the price board."

Clerks came out and quickly hung up the board.

Every eye in the crowd focused on the board. It clearly displayed: two *liang* five *qian*.

A sigh of relief swept through the crowd like a gust of wind.

"Fellow elders and neighbors!" Liao Daxing frantically repeated in his mind what Wen Tong had told him. "Our South China Factory and South China Trading House may be new to this area, but we're proper, honest businessmen. Over these past few months, making sugar for you all—you've seen the quality for yourselves. Now that sugar prices are high outside, South China was actually worried about not having enough sugar to sell. That you've all favored South China like this—we're deeply grateful, deeply grateful." He clasped his hands and bowed all around. "Our master says: anyone who has sugar to sell, just come sell it. South China has plenty of silver and rice for buying. Open for business!" He made another bow and went back inside without looking back.

This declaration, combined with the unchanged price, temporarily calmed the restless crowd. But this was only a stopgap measure. What came next would depend on how the Executive Committee handled things.

The Executive Committee received the urgent dispatch that same day. The Foreign Affairs Ministry convened an emergency meeting. Since this involved allocating funds, it became a joint meeting between the Finance Ministry and Foreign Affairs Ministry.

"Right now, Lingao's entire silver reserve is less than forty thousand *liang*." Cheng Dong lowered his voice when mentioning the silver figure—this was one of the Transmigration Collective's top secrets.

Forty thousand *liang* could only buy sixteen thousand *shi* of sugar. For the hundred-thousand-plus *shi* of sugar poised to flood South China's doorstep, this was a drop in the bucket.

"Out of money? Don't we still have some from selling to Macau?"

"Those Indian bills of exchange can't be cashed in Leizhou—we'd have to go to Macau at least. Besides, it's only about twenty thousand pesos."

"Have the Guangzhou Station raise it."

"I've contacted the Guangzhou Station." Cheng Dong said. "The original plan was for the Guangzhou Station to raise a hundred thousand *liang* and send it to Leizhou specifically to purchase Leizhou sugar. But shipping that much cash was too difficult, and security couldn't be guaranteed. So they adopted the idea of Chang Shide from Leizhou Sugar Industry: use some Leizhou sugar to exchange for Vietnamese rice, then use Vietnamese rice to buy Leizhou sugar. It was a good concept, and no one anticipated this kind of 'rush to sell' event. With so much supply suddenly flooding in, the silver hadn't been transferred."

Wen Desi said: "This is tricky. The risks are significant, but we should still transfer cash to Leizhou. The *Great Whale* probably won't be back anytime soon."

"The *Great Whale* doesn't have a radio. Otherwise, we could telegraph them right away to buy rice and come back."

"What if we ship rice from Lingao or Guangzhou? Chang Shide mentioned in his report that rice prices in Leizhou are very high."

"That probably won't work," Yan Ming spoke up. He was the newly appointed manager of "Delong Grain Trading House." "We don't have that much grain in stock." Ever since they'd issued the Lingao Grain Circulation Certificates, grain had become a figure the bank monitored daily. "And daily grain consumption is quite large. Moving several thousand *shi* would endanger our reserves."

"Shipping grain from Guangzhou is the same as shipping silver," Wen Desi said. "Too slow. Sailboats take six to seven days round trip. By the time it reaches Leizhou, it'll be too late."

"I agree with Wen Zong: we need to send silver!" Ma Qianzhu frowned. "If we don't send silver, South China Factory will be squeezed out. The great situation we've built up in Leizhou will be gone."
