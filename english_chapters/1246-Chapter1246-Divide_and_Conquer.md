# Chapter 1246 - Divide and Conquer

While the First Squadron was fiercely bombarding the three-masted gunships, the Special Service Boat Squadrons entered Liaoluo Bay in a single column parallel to the coast. As they approached to within one thousand meters, the squadrons, led by the lead squadron, turned their bows to sail parallel to the coastline. Using the enemy ships already hit and burning from the First Squadron's earlier fire as reference targets, each ship fired at will. Their orders were simple: fire at maximum rate.

Guided by the burning ships on the sea and signal rockets fired occasionally by the Special Recon teams on shore, the Special Service Boat Squadrons fired their cannons and carronades in turns. The cannon squadrons fired from a distance to suppress, followed by carronade squadrons closing in for the kill—the large-caliber shells of the latter had greater power upon impact. In accordance with pre-battle instructions, they fired large quantities of explosive shells and red-hot incendiary shots to achieve maximum destructive effect on wooden ships.

The five Special Service Boat Squadrons sailed while spewing thick smoke and fierce fire from their broadsides, raining shells down. Along the coast of Liaoluo Bay, artillery fire howled, smoke obscured the sky, and explosions mixed with red flames rose one after another. Currently, smoke and fire from hit ships rushed straight into the clouds, obscuring even the rising sun. Shouts of firing commands, screams of the wounded, angry roars, and curses echoed amidst the rumble of cannons. The massive fleet gathered in Liaoluo Bay melted like an iceberg under the scorching sun; ships were hit and burned one after another. The huge fires rising from the water surface even ignited many ships near the shore that hadn't yet faced Australian cannon fire. All of Liaoluo Bay was ablaze.

The Red Barbarian Cannon batteries the Zheng family had pre-positioned along the Liaoluo Bay coast finally opened fire in retaliation. But in the chaos on the water, even observing targets was difficult, let alone firing effectively. Scattered shells were fired randomly without specific targets; most fell into the sea, and a few even hit their own ships.

The moment the first round of shells flew over, Ning Liujin let out a scream and jumped into the sea with a splash—he couldn't explain why he did it himself, but a great fear in his heart told him: run.

His escape was timely. When Ning Liujin, dripping wet and exhausted, crawled onto the beach of Liaoluo Bay, behind him was a sea of fire. Sounds of gunpowder magazines exploding rose one after another; the heat from burning ships in the bay made him feel scorching hot even lying on the sand.

The beach was already crawling with loudly panting sailors, mouths wide open, gasping for air—swimming across water filled with burning wreckage was no easy task.

Burning embers danced in the air, like countless fireflies, occasionally blown onto the beach. Several Zheng soldiers pushed a wheelbarrow loaded with a rectangular box onto the beach, hurriedly lit the fuse. Ning Liujin only saw a blur before his eyes, and instantly a dozen rockets shot out. It looked very majestic, but these rockets trailing smoke didn't fly far at all; one after another fell into the bay, some even setting their own ships on fire.

"Bastards, what the hell are you shooting at!" Ning Liujin heard someone cursing and panting nearby. He hadn't caught his breath yet and was panting desperately when a cannonball suddenly flew from the sea, landed on the beach, and exploded with a boom, instantly blasting several gasping men into bloody pulp. Ning Liujin didn't care about catching his breath anymore; he scrambled hands and feet toward the island's interior.

He ran just in time. At 5:40, the Fire Support Squadron that followed the Special Service Boat Squadrons into the bay arrived at their station under tow by Daihatsu landing craft. 30 rocket boats fired a volley of Hale rockets at the remaining ships in the bay, each boat launching 30 rockets. Instantly, it was as if countless meteorites descended from the sky simultaneously. Just this scene was enough to shatter the courage of the remaining Zheng sailors and soldiers. The guns from the shore batteries fell completely silent. The fire in Liaoluo Bay burned even more fiercely.

At 6:30 AM, the lead squadron turned around south of Rushan, starting the return leg, firing at the remaining Zheng fleet in the bay with guns on the other side. By now, not one in ten of the Zheng fleet in Liaoluo Bay remained. Most ships originally anchored on the inner side were also ignited, thick smoke rolling across the water surface, making observation difficult. Moreover, Special Recon teams lurking at Rushan and other places sent telegrams stating the bombardment effect was excellent and there was no need to continue. Ming Qiu, observing the enemy situation on the *Lichun*, believed the first phase operational objective had been achieved and there was no need to waste more shells on wreckage. Thus, he signaled the Special Service Boat Squadrons to withdraw from combat, reload, and cover the Army landing.

"Notify all ships to pay close attention to fire ships," Ming Qiu ordered. The only thing that could threaten them now was fire ships. Back then, Zheng Zhilong had relied on this to drive the Dutch out of the Xiamen area, forcing them to accept his trade terms.

Although the Dutch were outnumbered, they had a significant advantage in naval technology at the time. Zheng Zhilong's ability to defeat the Dutch showed that the Zheng navy had considerable experience in using fire ships and must have unique tactical approaches.

Rowboats and motorized boats sent boatload after boatload of Marines and Army soldiers onto the beach—since the fire along the Liaoluo Bay coast was too hot, the landing site was chosen at the beach under Houhu Mountain. There was originally a stockade on the mountain, but the defenders had routed under Navy rocket bombardment. Old Di led his 1st Expeditionary Force onto the beach without encountering any resistance.

Just as estimated, the Zheng family army on Kinmen Island didn't put up too fierce a resistance. Most abandoned their stockades and fled; many fled to the north side of the island to take boats across the sea to the mainland. Most threw away swords, spears, and armor, fleeing into the mountainous areas in the island's center.

By around 7:00, Kinmen Island had officially changed hands. On the successful high ground of the old timeline, the Morning Star flag rose slowly.

Ming Qiu immediately appointed Old Di as Kinmen Garrison Commander, responsible for clearing the entire island. At the same time, he allocated him several patrol boats and motorboats, ordering him to take Lesser Kinmen Island before noon that day, clearing the enemy there and controlling the waters around Greater and Lesser Kinmen.

"Guaranteed to complete the mission!" Old Di's face flushed red with joy, roaring as he saluted—he had been stuck in the miserable position of a Marine company commander for several years. A year ago he finally managed to become a battalion-level commander, and now he was finally a "Commander."

"I leave matters here to you. We're going to attack Xiamen and Anping immediately," Ming Qiu instructed. "Contact us anytime if there's a situation."

After assigning the tasks, Ming Qiu immediately split his forces into two. The First Squadron proceeded to Xiamen Island to clear the Zheng fleet in Xiamen Bay and cover troops landing on Xiamen Island. The Special Service Boat Squadron and Motorboat Group attacked Anping.

Although Anping was Zheng Zhilong's lair, Ming Qiu considered that Anping was located at the mouth of the Shijing River, six or seven kilometers from Weitou Bay. Typically, to attack Anping, the fleet would have to enter the Shijing River and go upstream. Special Recon had reconnoitered the hydrology of the Shijing River; *Lichun* could theoretically reach Anping directly. But the river surface here was only about 2 kilometers wide, full of hidden sandbanks, the channel winding. It was difficult for steam gunboats to maneuver, making it exactly the place where enemy fire ships could fully unleash their effectiveness. So Ming Qiu finally decided not to commit the First Squadron to this area, but to switch to special service boats and motorboats. When wind and tide were unfavorable, motorboats would tow the special service boats into combat.

The Army and Navy forces attacking Anping were under the general command of Shi Zhiqi, with First Fleet Chief of Staff Li Di commanding naval vessels. For this purpose, he had already transferred his commodore's flag to a larger special service boat. Now, the three commanders parted ways, each going to execute their own missions.

Li Huamei stood at her battle station on the *Lichun*, gazing at the rolling black smoke rushing into the clouds. The battle just now was like a grand fireworks display—she had never seen such a magnificent and cruel war. The Australians freely chose the timing to kill people and destroy ships; the Zheng fleet had no power to resist. The phrase "an eagle fighting a rabbit" was insufficient to express this terrifying disparity.

Indeed, Li Huamei knew: by European standards, Zheng Zhilong's fleet, apart from its scale, was not worth mentioning in terms of ship level. Let alone Spanish galleons, even ordinary 20-gun Dutch merchant ships were enough to face 2-3 Zheng family 8-gun three-masted ships on the sea without falling behind.

But that was only "some advantage," far from the crushing momentum of the First Squadron led by *Lichun* now—it was a completely one-sided massacre. The result was decided the moment they broke into Liaoluo Bay. No, one could even say, from the moment they decided to wage war on Zheng Zhilong, the fire in Liaoluo Bay was a foregone conclusion.

In that case, weren't they already invincible in the world long ago? Amidst her shock, she couldn't help but secretly wonder. Not to mention a mere sea lord like Zheng Zhilong, even landing on the mainland, destroying the Ming, and changing the dynasty wouldn't be difficult. Why hide in a barbaric southern frontier land like Hainan, doing all kinds of hard labor? Taking the world, sitting on the dragon throne—isn't "I can replace him" the highest ideal of all heroes under heaven?

*Lichun* turned its direction. Li Huamei noticed the black smoke-belching ships of the First Squadron were heading toward Dadan and Erdan islands. She immediately understood they were going to attack Xiamen.

Around Xiamen and Gulangyu, there were many merchant ships; it was an important port for Zheng family trade. The Australians sending their main force straight there was obviously intended to inflict heavy damage on his foundation. As Li Huamei thought this while watching the Australian fleet movements, she discovered a large group of ships was heading toward Anping. Her heart gave a jolt: *This means they intend to wipe them out before breakfast!*

*I didn't expect the Australians to be so ruthless!* Li Huamei felt a wave of annoyance. If the Australians found out about her secret dealings with the Spanish, Dutch, and Zheng Zhilong, she and the young miss would probably die without a burial place! Thinking of this, a layer of fine sweat broke out on her back.
