# Chapter 310 - Sweet Port Crisis: Dying Struggles

"Richangji, seven thousand *shi*," Feng Guangfeng followed up. "I'll deliver the silver shortly."

With two firms committed, the others who had been observing also pledged their numbers—some three thousand, some five thousand, some ten thousand. The total exceeded one hundred fifty thousand *shi*. Chen Tianxiong knew that most were holding back; these figures were just stones cast to test the water.

However, if they were too enthusiastic, Huanan would have to regurgitate some of the sugar already collected to ration it to them, which would be a loss. This way, everyone was satisfied.

"With this Sugar Industry Guild, what about the Haiyi Guild?" someone asked the sharp question. If Master Zhu forbade them from joining and insisted on maintaining the Haiyi Guild, how would they handle him?

The representatives shifted uneasily in their seats, whispering.

Everyone knew Master Zhu wouldn't give up easily; a vicious fight was inevitable. He had money and the ability to direct various dark forces. He was not to be underestimated.

To this, Chang Shide replied: Huanan would handle the matter properly. Specific negotiations would be conducted by Huanan. If Master Zhu looked for trouble with anyone, Huanan would stand up for them, never breaking its word.

"I think everyone knows: Huanan has the ability not to break its word."

Chang Shide spoke decisively. The attendees, though somewhat uneasy, accepted it.

"The meeting was a success," Wen Tong said to Chang Shide. "But why not form a joint-stock company directly? Why start with proxy purchasing and sales?"

"Let them taste the sweetness first," Chang Shide said. "At the start, they don't trust us enough. Once this year's business is done and they see the benefits of following us over that rubbish Haiyi Guild, talking about a joint-stock company will be promising."

"The next step is consolidating gains, especially guarding against Zhu An's counterattack," Chen Tianxiong reminded them. "Master Zhu is still on Hai'an Street. A centipede dies but doesn't freeze stiff. His dormancy might be waiting for a chance to strike. We need a response plan quickly."

"Ideally, neutralize him quickly, or long nights will bring many dreams." Chang Shide warned: whether the Leizhou Sugar Industry Guild could ultimately be established depended on Huanan's ability to swiftly eliminate Master Zhu's power.

"We could just off him, but that might make these sugar merchants feel 'the fox mourns the death of the rabbit'." Chang Shide propped his chin on his hand. "Hesitating to shoot for fear of breaking the vase."

"Ignore that for now. Make Feng Guangfeng the liaison. Tell them all funds must be paid within three days, or the contracts are void," Chen Tianxiong said. "This money is their pledge of allegiance, preventing wavering."

"Right, I'll have Liao Daxing handle it, and tell Liao Diahua to prepare men and carts to pick up silver on Hai'an Street."

This was no small sum. Chen Tianxiong calculated after the meeting and was shocked—these merchants would hand over 375,000 taels of silver! nearly 15 tons in metric terms!

"Truly a lot!" Chen Tianxiong felt the importance of a bank even more. Leaving aside paper currency, if there were remittance services, a single draft would solve this. Now, moving and storing 15 tons of silver was a headache.

Since starting sugar acquisitions, Huanan had spent massive time and energy on storing, guarding, and dispensing silver. All silver shipped in was "Official Treasure" re-smelted in Guangzhou furnaces—uniform purity, fifty taels per ingot. This simplified packing, transport, and counting.

But in actual operation, it became complex. Sugar payments were fractional; one couldn't use fifty-tael ingots for everything. Huanan had to buy silver shears and scales. Whole ingots were clipped into fragments. The process was tedious and incurred high wastage.

As for the silver coming from the sugar firms, it would undoubtedly be broken bits of varying purity. Liao Daxing had warned them to find assayers early; mistaking debased silver for pure "snowflake" silver would mean huge losses.

"The Executive Committee has opened a bank in Guangzhou," Wen Tong passed around a recent internal bulletin. "I think we can request a local bank here."

"Call it Huanan Sugar Bank!" Chang Shide had a sudden idea. "We'll soon have nearly 400,000 in cash—isn't that a reserve?"

"The name is inappropriate," Chen Tianxiong said. "Financial systems must follow the Executive Committee's unified arrangement; we shouldn't start our own set. Besides, we aren't finance people. Best let professionals handle it."

Chang Shide, sharp as he was, understood immediately. "Right, right. Let's telegram the Executive Committee to open a branch." He added, "Leizhou's sugar industry really needs a bank."

"Yes," Wen Tong said. "After controlling sales, the next step is helping farmers increase production."

Increasing production required promoting new planting techniques and sugar cooperatives. Gaining farmers' trust wasn't easy, but they had built a good reputation during this acquisition war. With a bank, they could use financial tools to issue low-interest loans to support production.

While they discussed, Zhou Shizhai asked to see them.

"Someone intends harm to Huanan," he said bluntly.

They exchanged glances. What should come had come—Master Zhu was indeed bent on destruction. Desperate like a cornered dog, he might use despicable means.

"What's the situation?"

"Liao Diahua's men heard that Zhao Jijiao's people are buying oil and dry firewood—they're a bunch of punks who don't cook. What do they need that for? Probably arson. They've been spending lavishly lately, gambling and whoring, clearly having received a big payout."

Zhou Shizhai wiped sweat from his brow. "Also, rumors are spreading in the Leizhou underworld that Huanan Sugar holds hundreds of thousands in silver but has weak defenses. Kidnapping a few managers could extort a huge sum."

"Vicious. Using unseen silver to lure others to do their dirty work," Chen Tianxiong commented.

"Don't joke. Being kidnapped would be ugly." Wen Tong looked grim.

"If Li Siya kidnapped you, you'd probably enjoy it. By the way, she's your clansman."

"Stop joking," Wen Tong said anxiously. "Li Siya or Li Sisu, what if we get kidnapped?"

"Kidnapping isn't a huge worry," Zhou Shizhai said. "Scattered bandits can't do much, and the managers carry weapons. The real concern is bandits banding together to raid—that must be guarded against."

"Banding together?" Chang Shide asked. "How?"

Zhou Shizhai explained that while there were no large bandit armies in Leizhou, small groups of four or five abounded, robbing lone travelers. Some groups under a hundred raided farmers. To rob a firm like Huanan, they'd need four or five hundred men. Bandits valued numbers; even if they lacked real fighters, they would drag along farmers to pad their ranks and intimidate civilians.

"Hai'an Street is richer than us. Why not rob them?" Wen Tong found it strange.

"Fear of death," Zhou Shizhai answered simply. Hai'an Street had hundreds of local militia paid by the shops. Well-fed and paid, they fought well. Bandits needed good teeth to bite that bone.

"Huanan is new. Bandits don't know our strength. If incited to believe there's a fortune here, they might gather a large force. We must guard against it." Zhou Shizhai now fully considered himself part of the Transmigration Group.

"How about the militia? Can they hold?"

"Yes," Zhou Shizhai said. "With Comrade Bei training them, they should hold for a while."

The transmigrators were less confident. They knew the militia's issues: workers were busy with factory tasks, leaving little time for training. Beiwei's arrival had only slightly improved things.

"Don't worry too much. This is the county seat's doorstep. Bandits dare not stay long; hit and run. As long as we deny them the initial success."

"True, but we must protect ourselves," Chen Tianxiong said. "Until this is settled, don't go out lightly. Strengthen gate guards. Keep militia on standby. Even when Liao One, Liao Two, or the Wen brothers go out, assign armed escorts."

"Beware of arson too," Chang Shide added. "The factory is okay; construction makes arson hard, and fires won't spread. But the workers' village for the unemployed—straw sheds. One spark and it's disaster. Deaths would be terrible."

"Old Wen, arrange for Liao Daxing to check it out. Give them a warning!"

"Also—" Chen Tianxiong remembered something. "Telegram Guangzhou and Lingao. The sea situation might not remain calm. We took out one Gu Dachun, but Wang Dachun or Li Dachun might covet this meat."

"Mm. And the Gu pirates aren't fully wiped out. Main force gone, but they have silver and men. They might return for revenge."

Lingao had sent a summary of enemy intelligence based on interrogations from the Juhua Islet battle. The Gu gang still had about twenty or thirty men and a single-masted boat for liaison.

"Since we have prisoners, why didn't the Navy just wipe them out at their base?" Wen Tong asked.

"Difficult," Chen Tianxiong explained. The pirate nest wasn't a water fortress on an island but ordinary fishing villages on the coast, mixed with regular fishermen. Hard to distinguish.

"Well, I think they will come." Chen Tianxiong leaned back. "Xiao Zhanfeng said Master Zhu has a concubine who is Gu Dachun's sister."

The atmosphere grew tense. In the following days, patrolling militia extinguished several fires started by tossed incendiaries. Thanks to fire prevention measures, only walls were blackened. Intelligence from Liao Diahua confirmed the arsonists were Zhao Jijiao's gang—punks with no grudge against Huanan, clearly hired by Master Zhu.

Arson attacks became frequent, occurring once or twice almost every night. Finding the factory and merchant house hard to burn, targets shifted to the workers' living quarters.

The most dangerous incident occurred in the workers' village. A straw shed was ignited at night. The factory watchtower pushed the alarm; the fire brigade extinguished it in ten minutes.

The arsonist was caught on the spot by workers. Recognized as one of Zhao Jijiao's punks, seeing no escape, he slammed his head against a rock, then lay howling on the ground covered in blood. The angry workers fell silent.

"What is he howling about?" Chang Shide asked.

"Basically that Huanan bullies people, beating him without cause. If we don't pay for his injuries, he'll die at our gate," Liao Daxing smiled bitterly. "These punks fear nothing. If provoked, they might really hang themselves at your door, causing a lawsuit that ruins you."

"Oh?" Chang Shide knew the type—"rolling blade meat" (tough hobos). Sending them to the yamen meant release soon after. Even with money spent, at most a beating and pillory, which they didn't fear. Punks often colluded with yamen runners. Even if officials wanted to act, subordinates would hamper them, turning big issues small. Hard to punish.

While wondering what to do, Ma Sanqiang squeezed through the crowd and shouted: "Boss, this man burned our house and injured a child inside! I ask the Boss one question: will you handle it?!"

Chang Shide understood the situation instantly. A punk's life versus the hearts of a host of sugar workers—the choice was obvious.

"Of course I'll handle it!" Chang Shide said decisively, waving his hand. "Serve this 'gentleman' well. Be clean about it!"

Several special forces soldiers brought by Beiwei were in the crowd. Hearing this, they moved instantly. One stepped on the man; another grabbed a handful of mud and straw, stuffing it into his mouth. The screaming punk gagged and went limp from asphyxiation. The two soldiers wrapped him in a straw mat and carried him away silently.
