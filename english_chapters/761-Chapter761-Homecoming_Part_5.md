# Chapter 761 – Homecoming (Part 5)

The new farming methods, irrigation works, improved seeds, homemade pesticides, and formulated fertilizers promoted by the Tiandihui had doubled crop yields per *mu*. For many farming households, cultivation had become profitable—not merely a struggle to scrape by. Every family with a bit of land was expanding operations, and many fields that had lain fallow because low yields made them unprofitable were now being tilled again.

The result was that labor had grown expensive. Lingao had never been an area with surplus workers; only the low agricultural output and the peasants' lack of motivation had masked the problem. Now, labor demand had surged, yet the pool of rural idlers had been drained—absorbed as industrial workers, enlisted in the army or navy, or enrolled in schools. The labor shortage was suddenly exposed.

The immediate effect was skyrocketing wages for hired hands. This pained landlords and rich peasants who were accustomed to getting a full day's work for a bowl of rice and a few coppers—humans naturally pursue profit.

"I suppose the mistress is still driving everyone from cockcrow to midnight?" The mistress was Fu Yijin's mother, so Fu Fu still observed some courtesy. But every child in the household both feared and resented the woman—her own offspring included.

Fu Xi gave a little laugh. "Of course. But the food is better now, and the mistress isn't as stingy as before. Otherwise, everyone would be clamoring to deregister."

With labor prices on the rise, work opportunities were everywhere—including daily recruitment at Bairren City. The old danger of leaving one's master and facing destitution or starvation was gone. If a household head continued to exploit and mistreat servants, they could simply walk away and work for the Australians. The master would lose a laborer for nothing, and even if he pursued recovery, he would only recoup a pittance of the original purchase price. That pittance was nowhere near enough to buy a replacement now. The poor had options: working for the Australians, enlisting, or attending school—all more than sufficient to stay fed. And the Australians now controlled the slave trade strictly, imposing a heavy tax on slaveholding.

Fu Yijin smiled awkwardly and said nothing. When Fu Fu asked whether the village had gotten bigger, he learned that Meiyang Village had indeed expanded considerably. Settlers assigned to the village had, with help from the Civil Affairs People's Committee and the Tiandihui, built a new residential district on wasteland across the small river from the old village, following one of the standard-village blueprints drawn up under Wen Desi's direction. As a result, Meiyang Village now numbered over 150 households with a population approaching a thousand.

"With all the newcomers, the village isn't peaceful anymore," Fu Yijin complained, frowning. "Father is village head, but the settlers pay him no mind. Not long ago there was even a brawl over water-release rights."

Now that the irrigation system was in place, no one depended solely on heaven. But during dry spells, which fields got water first and how much became a flashpoint.

"Why?" Fu Fu found this strange. Normally it was the settlers who got bullied. Before he set out on leave, the officers at the pre-departure assembly had stressed the importance of "uniting with the migrants and helping them."

Fu Yijin didn't want to say more; she felt it wasn't a woman's place to speak on such matters, and anyway she couldn't have explained it clearly if she'd tried.

Fu Xi, meanwhile, was a student and could articulate things better. "How would the migrants get bullied? Now it's half and half. And the settlers were given land all at once—plus grain, tools, and seed—leveling rich and poor alike. In a strange new place, they pull together. Our villagers are split—some rich, some poor. When a rich man gets pushed around by settlers, the poor folk just laugh; no one sticks up for him."

"I see," Fu Fu said. "So isn't that the migrants bullying the original villagers?"

"Those outsiders are ungrateful," Fu Yijin grumbled. "The land was ours to begin with, yet so much was handed over to them. And the first year's grain, the labor to build their houses—our village provided it all. Now they've got land, they've settled in, and suddenly they strut about." She seemed to feel the village had been badly cheated and started rambling. Uneducated, she spoke without organization, jumping from one thing to another until Fu Fu was thoroughly confused. The bottom line: the settlers were unreasonable and ungrateful.

"It's not that simple," Fu Xi interjected. Her position was more detached, and her attachment to Meiyang Village was less deep. "The settlers' land was wasteland the village hadn't cultivated for years. The land-clearing and house-building involved community labor, sure, but the leadership paid for it—it wasn't free. And that first year's rations came from fines on hidden-acreage fraud—not charity. Nobody owes anyone. That said, the settlers feel they have the numbers, so they don't defer to village management—that's also true. They talk about fairness while always putting themselves first. The water-release brawl started exactly that way."

"So everyone's become enemies now?"

"Not quite. After the fight, the resident policeman and Father brought together the ringleaders from both sides for a chat, and everyone patched things up—no one was killed, after all, and they see each other every day, so they can't live in constant combat mode. But right now neither side will speak to the other. Clear boundary lines. If your duck wanders over to their side, consider it lost."

Fu Fu had been indoctrinated in the army with "unity" thinking and blurted out, "That's no good."

"Of course not. Father's job as village head has gotten nearly impossible—apart from the tasks handed down from above, nobody obeys him. When Manager Wan comes to teach new farming techniques, both sides are Tiandihui clients, yet they refuse to attend together. He has to hold two sessions. Any village project is hard to get done because the two sides work at cross-purposes. Father's village headship is basically half a village headship." Fu Xi pulled a few wildflowers from the roadside and began weaving them into a wreath. "I expect Father will be pouring out his grievances to Manager Wan again tonight."

"And the leadership doesn't do anything?"

"Manager Wan says he's Tiandihui, so it's not his department," Fu Yijin continued to complain. "He told Father to report it to higher-ups. But Father doesn't dare—"

"Because he's afraid the leadership will think he can't get the job done and strip him of the headship," Fu Xi said. She no longer showed any trace of deference or fear toward the master. "As long as nothing big blows up, he'll just sit on it."

The three of them chatted and laughed as they walked toward the village. The section where the original residents lived was now called East Village; the layout was mostly unchanged, and most of the houses were the same as before. Only the little river at the village entrance had grown much cleaner—the manure-collecting campaign had scoured it out. The rickety wooden bridge had been rebuilt, now wide and sturdy.

At the entrance stood a new public latrine. Fu Xi said there was another at the far end of the village. There was nothing remarkable about it except that the cesspit was brick-lined and coated with cement—villagers complained that the Australians were extravagantly wasteful. Supposedly this was for producing "biogas." What biogas was and what use it had, no one yet knew.

"They call it 'centralized manure collection,'" Fu Xi said. "It keeps the houses cleaner."

The houses in East Village looked shabby compared to the all-new, fortress-style dwellings of West Village. Though the migrants lived in structures unlike anything the locals had ever seen, Fu Fu knew that even if each household's floor space was modest, the amenities were complete. The houses were solid brick and tile, watertight in summer, draft-free in winter—very comfortable. On the strength of the brick-and-tile construction alone, West Village outclassed nearly all of East Village. After all, in the old Meiyang only a handful of families had lived in brick houses. Everyone else had walls of mud-plastered bamboo mat—whitewash was a luxury—and, needless to say, thatch roofs.

No wonder there was friction between settlers and natives, Fu Fu thought. The disparity was too stark. He couldn't understand why the leadership treated the migrants so generously, giving them free houses that in the past only landlords could afford.

The Fu Bu'er household's own house had just been renovated. After last year's land survey concluded, the Tiandihui, wanting to set up a model farmer, let Fu Bu'er sharecrop most of the land confiscated from the Fu Yousun household. Fu Bu'er had tasted success with soil improvement and thin-spaced rice planting, gained confidence, and was willing both to invest and to follow the agricultural technician's guidance. This year had brought a bumper harvest—the broad beans grown to improve the soil alone had sold for about ten thousand *jin* to the Tiandihui.

Cash in hand and village headship secured, Fu Bu'er had immediately set about rebuilding the house—the traditional instinct of a Chinese peasant. This caught the attention of Ye Yuming and Wu Nanhai. To turn Fu Bu'er into a "new agriculture, new village" model figure—and to establish a vivid example for the next phase, when farmers would be encouraged to develop "courtyard economies" and large-scale sidelines—Wan Lihui talked Fu Bu'er into building an "Australian-style farm manor." The Tiandihui brought in architects and workers from the Lingao Construction Company, and using drawings from the Grand Library's various "new countryside" blueprints, adapted to local conditions, they constructed this manor for the Fu family.

Besides living quarters, the compound accommodated sideline operations, storage, and processing. The layout was rational, the space used efficiently. In practicality and livability, it was three hundred years ahead of the finest landlord mansions in Lingao. The ultimate luxury: the manor had a proper indoor toilet—not the old dung-pit.

Of course, Fu Bu'er had paid dearly for it. By the time the house was finished, he was flat broke and had to apply for a Tiandihui loan to resume production.
