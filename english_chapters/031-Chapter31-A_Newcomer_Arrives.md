# Chapter 31: A Newcomer Arrives

At the Nanxiong Prefecture wharf, boats of all sizes lay at anchor. This was Guangdong's key north-south transit point—merchants traveling south crossed Dayu Ridge from Nan'an in Jiangxi, then switched to boats at Nanxiong and sailed straight down to Guangzhou.

Young Eunuch Yang—Yang Tianliang—had come from Beijing on two gallery boats. One carried him and his attending servants and maidservants; the other carried secretaries, stewards, hangers-on, guards. Neither boat displayed flags, plaques, or silk lanterns. Eunuch Yang was far from a palace favorite—he could barely secure his own position. Displaying insignia would only invite jealousy; though some officials might wish to pay respects, Young Eunuch Yang least liked ceremonies of welcome and farewell. So whether by sedan or by boat, arriving anywhere, they neither disturbed official relay stations nor sent calling cards. They simply traveled in silence. Now, having rested a day aboard ship, half the journey's fatigue had lifted. The hangers-on invited him to cards; he declined all invitations.

Not that he disliked mahjong. It was just that this journey south brought particular bitterness to his heart.

Yang Tianliang had entered the palace late in the Wanli reign and been assigned under Eunuch Yang, who valued him and adopted him as godson. Eunuch Yang was one of Gao Shiming's trusted aides. Backed by these two great trees, his future had seemed bright. But once the "Nine Thousand Years" came to power, Senior Eunuch Gao retired to protect himself. His godfather was either banished to dig at tomb-construction sites or kept idle in the palace. He himself had gone years without a real assignment. Fortunately, old connections remained; he obtained a position overseeing the scripture-printing workshop.

Father and son rarely met; outside official duties, they only managed private properties. On palace and court affairs they said nothing, striving to avoid suspicion.

Yet as the Nine Thousand Years' power grew boundless, their days grew harder. Watching scholars at court tremble into submission or be dismissed... Starting from the intercalary sixth month last year, when Zhejiang's Provincial Governor Pan Ruzhen submitted a memorial requesting construction of a living shrine to Wei Zhongxian, officials everywhere scrambled to make similar requests. Already over forty shrines had been proposed. This stirred the long-sidelined Eunuch Yang's ambitions.

Currently, those petitioning for living shrines were all court officials and local officers; no palace eunuch had yet taken the lead. What if he joined in? Perhaps the Nine Thousand Years' impression might change dramatically—a chance for a turnaround. At minimum, he'd leave an impression of deference.

But on second thought, it seemed wrong. He wasn't one of the inner circle; doing this would be abrupt and a great affront to Wei Zhongxian's palace confidants—one couldn't steal thunder when flattering. After much deliberation: officials and gentry had initiated shrine construction; only the merchant-commoner class hadn't moved. He could mobilize them. He had Gao Ju as a piece in Guangzhou; lately, the man had sent quite a few foreign novelties as tribute—he must have made a fortune. Let him put up the money and take the lead.

This was why Yang Tianliang was sent to Guangzhou. Per his godfather's instructions, this living shrine must be grand and magnificent and demonstrate the "sincere devotion" of the merchant-commoner class. As long as Gao Ju led a group of merchants in submitting a petition, the Guangdong provincial officials would never dare refuse.

As for cost—Eunuch Yang didn't concern himself. After all, Gao Ju had benefited from his protection for years; bleeding a little was only fair—they were bound together in fortune and ruin.

But Yang Tianliang saw it differently. His thinking went deeper. The cycle of glory and decay knew no exceptions. The Nine Thousand Years was now in his heyday—flowers brocaded, oil ablaze. This bit of icing meant nothing to him. But should the fall come, this would become irremovable iron evidence!

At this thought, he shuddered. He glanced around. He suspected there were Eastern Depot agents among his entourage; even *thinking* such things made one break into cold sweats.

Though he kept his head down, Yang Tianliang had thought every day about how to manage this matter to achieve both ends. He felt his godfather was short-sighted, always thinking about money, believing it was enough to have Gao Ju pay and arrange things. But after the deed was done? A grand living shrine to the Nine Thousand Years—whether it became monument or evidence depended on fate. The Emperor was "the Ten Thousand Years," but His Majesty's health didn't look like it could last for all ages...

What to do? Wearily, he pressed his brow and leaned back.

A young attending eunuch crept in. Seeing him resting with eyes closed, he dared not speak, only waited silently. But Yang Tianliang knew someone had entered. He grunted:

"What is it?"

"Reporting to the master: Master Gao's steward has been waiting at the wharf."

"Show him in."

The steward entered and kowtowed. Yang Tianliang recognized him—Steward Gao Ye, who often came to Beijing with tributes. Young, with polished speech and manner—a social operator.

Besides conveying Master Gao's greetings, he had brought a boatload of fine wine, food, and supplies. Also several young male and female musicians for entertainment on the journey.

Most remarkable was a fine wooden box, which Gao Ye presented last, saying it was a token of Master Gao's regard—specially purchased from the Australian merchants.

"Australian merchants"—Yang Tianliang had heard that name repeatedly. In spring, Gao Ju had written that some Australian sea merchants had arrived in Guangzhou with novel goods. He had sent some items: crystal mirrors, lighters that ignited with a flick...

He opened the inlaid lacquer box. Inside were mounted two small golden cases, gleaming brilliantly, neither gold nor jade. In the center of each were three strange patterns—impossible to identify. Between them was mounted something like a small candlestick holder, apparently niello-inlaid, though crude and simple.

He glanced inquiringly at Gao Ye, who gently extracted a paper pack, carefully opened the lid, revealing a shiny silver sheet inside. Peeling it back revealed a neat row of white sticks. A fragrant aroma wafted out.

"Is that tobacco?" Yang Tianliang's small vice was smoking; he immediately recognized the scent.

"Paper cigarettes from Australia. My master specially presents them to you." He respectfully drew one out and offered it.

Yang Tianliang held the cigarette. Snow-white throughout; one end showed pale-gold tobacco shreds, the other packed white like compressed cotton. He didn't know how to handle it. He smoked with a pipe; he'd sampled Western snuff; but he'd never seen anything like this.

Under Gao Ye's demonstration, he placed it in his mouth, lit it with that candlestick-like lighter, and took a puff. The tobacco seemed ordinary—mild-flavored, with an unfamiliar fragrance. But the way the paper-wrapped tobacco glowed and dimmed, never going out or falling off—that was remarkable.

"Just paper-wrapped tobacco, yet so elaborately presented. Same style as the Australian lighter your master sent last time." Though he said this, he was quite taken with the cigarettes. He fondled the case, reluctant to put it down. *This could make a fine gift for court dignitaries.*

"Steward Gao, does the Australian merchant have more of these?"

"Yes. The merchants brought quite a few."

"Good. When we reach Guangzhou, prepare several dozen boxes—and include matching lighters."

"I understand."

Seeing Young Eunuch Yang say no more but close his eyes, Gao Ye slowly withdrew.

As Young Eunuch Yang's boat drifted down the river, the transmigrators completed another round of trade. Cigarettes were a newly developed item. Wen Desi requested that Master Gao sell Gao Chang to them. Though they had considered covert schemes, every angle led to discovery. Rather than sneaking around, better to proceed openly. Master Gao was surprised, but assumed this was Gao Qing's request—finding a way out for his good-for-nothing sworn brother. Gao Chang was no confidant. He agreed readily, not even asking for a purchase price.

Gao Chang came over with just his bedroll. After greeting his new masters, he said he wanted to change his surname to Wen. The transmigrators had never considered such matters; now that Gao Chang raised it, they realized changing surnames was significant—a means for servants to develop belonging. But "Wen" wasn't quite right; this was everyone's undertaking. Xiao Zishan suggested: rather than some arbitrary surname, why not restore his original family name? This could win hearts—Chinese people took ancestral matters seriously. Losing one's surname was the greatest shame; regaining it was the greatest honor.

When they asked his thoughts, the big fellow dropped to his knees, knocked his head loudly, tears streaming down his face.

"By the masters' grace, restoring my original surname—from now on, I, Sun Chang, belong to the masters. Through fire or water, whatever the masters command!"

"And if we return to Australia, never to come back?"

"Wherever the masters go, Sun Chang follows—to the ends of the earth, without a second word!" Sun Chang spoke with iron resolve.

*They'd thought recruiting followers was hard. This easy? Our main-character aura has finally manifested!*
