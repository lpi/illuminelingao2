Chapter 31 A Newcomer Arrives

In the following days, the Transmigrators continued to maintain the subtle relationship with Master Gao. Xiao Zishan occasionally revealed some "predictions" about the court situation, which made Master Gao dubious.

However, as time went by, when some news from the capital really matched Xiao Zishan's predictions, Master Gao's attitude changed significantly. He became more respectful and even a little fearful of these "Australian masters".

"Master Xiao is really a god!" Master Gao once sighed with emotion in private, "Could it be that Australia is really a place connected to heaven?"

While consolidating the relationship with Master Gao, the Transmigrators also ushered in a new member.

This person's name was "Wen Tong".

Wen Tong was a young man in his twenties, looking refined and somewhat shy. He claimed to be a college student who accidentally traveled to the Ming Dynasty while hiking.

When Wen Tong appeared at the Transmigrators' stronghold in Guangzhou, everyone was stunned.

"Another one?" Wen Desi looked at the young man in front of him, a little dumbfounded.

"Are you... also Transmigrators?" Wen Tong was also surprised, "I thought I was the only one."

After some communication, everyone confirmed Wen Tong's identity. He indeed came from the 21st century, and the time of crossing was similar to everyone else.

However, Wen Tong's crossing method was a bit special. He didn't come through the wormhole, but inexplicably appeared in a forest in the Ming Dynasty.

"I got lost while hiking in the mountains, then walked and walked, and suddenly arrived here." Wen Tong said innocently.

Everyone looked at each other. This kind of "passive crossing" was unheard of.

However, since he was a fellow countryman, of course they had to take him in.

Wen Tong quickly integrated into the collective. He was modest and eager to learn, and had some special skills.

He was a biology major, familiar with various plants and animals. This was a timely help for the Agricultural Group.

"This is cinchona tree, bark can extract quinine, treat malaria." Wen Tong pointed to a tree specimen and said.

"This is rubber grass, roots contain rubber."

"This is wild rice..."

With Wen Tong's help, the Transmigrators discovered many useful plant resources in the Ming Dynasty.

In addition, Wen Tong was also a painting enthusiast. He could draw very realistic sketches and watercolors.

"This skill is useful!" Lin Baiguang's eyes lit up, "We can let him draw maps, draw character portraits, record terrain..."

So, Wen Tong became a "combat artist" of the Intelligence Group. He followed the reconnaissance team around, recording everything he saw with a paintbrush.

His paintings were accurate and detailed, much more useful than those dry text descriptions.

"Talent!" Wen Desi patted Wen Tong's shoulder, "We need people like you."

With the addition of Wen Tong, the team of Transmigrators grew stronger.

However, they also faced new challenges.

With the expansion of the team and the increase of activities, their expenses were getting bigger and bigger. The funds earned from selling porcelain and glass were gradually running out.

"We need new sources of income." At a financial meeting, Xiao Zishan said worriedly.

"How about selling arms?" Someone suggested.

"No." Wen Desi denied it immediately, "Selling arms is too risky and easy to attract the attention of the government."

"What about selling medicine?"

"Medicine can be considered, but the market capacity is limited."

"Why don't we... open a bank?" A member of the Financial Group proposed.

"Open a bank?" Everyone's eyes lit up.

"Yes. We have advanced financial knowledge and management systems. We can open a modern bank in the Ming Dynasty." The member analyzed, "We can absorb deposits, issue loans, and conduct exchange business... This is a huge market."

"But, do the people of the Ming Dynasty trust us?" Someone questioned.

"Trust is built." Wen Desi said, "We can start small, establish credibility first, and then expand slowly."

"Moreover," Wen Desi's eyes flashed with a glimmer of light, "Opening a bank can not only make money, but also control the economic lifeline of the Ming Dynasty. This is of great strategic significance for our future development."

"Just do it!"

So, a plan to open the "Australian Bank" was put on the agenda.

The Transmigrators began to select sites, recruit shopkeepers, and design bank notes... They wanted to set off a financial storm in the Ming Dynasty.
