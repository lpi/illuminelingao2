# Chapter 1993 - Custom Tax

Neither having a secretary to pa-pa like Liu Xiang, nor having Mu Min's style of dragging gun to check posts on streets at midnight, so after training ended today, Ai Zhixin sent someone calling him to talk things in dorm, he agreed readily.

Entering room Wang Qiyi discovered besides Ai Xinyi there seemed an extra girl serving.

"Our bureau's? Doesn't look like." Wang Qiyi asked in low voice leaning on Ai Zhixin's shoulder.

"No, isn't, don't talk nonsense," Ai Zhixin immediately came with a Denial Triple righteously. "With your wife sitting in town there, I dare not. I can't bear the Iron Fist of Justice smashing down."

"Hehe." Wang Qiyi laughed dryly noncommittally.

"It's just chosen by a few buddies for me, saying after all..." Seeing Ai Xinyi turned to side room to tidy things, Ai Zhixin whispered, "Xinyi is still somewhat inconvenient. Besides comprehensive quality of these students from Arts and Sciences College established after Maid School withdrawal is quite high. You know, besides bed, communication between two people is also very important. Otherwise what difference from living doll."

"That is natural, that is natural." Wang Qiyi had no life secretary, no say in this aspect. But secretly despised in heart—Aren't you just treating life secretary as living doll!

"Old Wang, let's talk business directly, not delay your rest," Ai Zhixin saw Wang Qiyi's expression realizing slight speech error. Opposite was father of three daughters; isn't said fathers with only daughters are natural feminists? Must pay attention in future. These two have to be served well now. "Liu Xiang still wanted to levy some tax types that day. We also discussed preliminarily. Do you have ideas?"

Speaking of professional problems, Deputy Director Wang came to spirit immediately.

"Slave Tax this is simple. We already have mature template in Lingao; just take over and use. Anyway data are complete. Clan Tax this also isn't hard. Just Clan Real Estate piece needs waiting for Field Clearing before knowing exactly. If Liu Xiang presses tight, levying directly according to Land Deed can also cope. Who let him Mayor Liu's hand not strictly out of city gate. Besides..."

"He also mentioned Flower Donation [Whore Tax]. What do you think is better for this." Ai Zhixin saw Wang Qiyi starting to diverge again, interrupted hurriedly.

"This, hard to handle." Wang Qiyi sighed in heart. "Too messy too dirty."

"Messy I feel yes, but dirty?" Ai Zhixin fished out two silver dollars from pocket. "You say these two dollars, which is clean which is dirty?"

"Also true. Why shout." Wang Qiyi leaned on chair carelessly. "Problem involves too much; tone hard to grasp."

"What's hard to grasp. Liu Xiang means forcing prostitution to goodness, encouraging labor. Then we combine prohibition with levy. You know other Senators' opinions too. One is Guangzhou isn't Lingao; gender ratio not so distorted. Two is if a woman can earn money lying down who goes to factory workshop. Another is, infertility ratio of prostitutes is too high, seriously wasting reproductive resources. We now lack population living under Senate rule since birth most. Finally, isn't this also opinion of those Universal Value Faction and female Senators like your wife?"

"Don't, my wife didn't, my wife isn't, don't talk nonsense." Wang Qiyi heard voice outside voice [implication], hurriedly threw Denial Triple back. These few sentences looked like valued compliments, actually contained profound contradictions within Senate. Just like Senator Pan Pan's drunken grumble sometimes: Eighty percent of male Senators are Right-wing Totalitarian Darwinist Socialist Straight Male Chauvinist Pigs.

Whether Chauvinist Pigs, this Deputy Director Wang hard to judge. But Senators all had votes; this was solid.

"We both are thirty-something running to forty. Can't see this point clear? See if she followed Du Wen making noise? She recognized Nan Wan'er as sister first. Nan Wan'er and I are pure male-female relation. We all treat her as sister..." Wang Qiyi face full of grievance. That night room check wasn't controlling your Director Ai's lower body ah.

"Yo, sister-in-law? Old Wang you like this taste!" Ai Zhixin hehe laughed. "You confess honestly, no ideas? Really no..."

"Roll! Still talking business or not."

"Talking business talking business." Ai Zhixin mood improved much after bickering with Wang Qiyi. Men after all communicate better with men. "In my opinion, this Flower Donation should be levied."

Hehehe, still young can't hold breath. Days ago Wang Qiyi found Ai Zhixin always saying something like being Arm-flinging Shopkeeper [hands-off boss] getting leisure. This sign was very bad. Leadership team infighting could cause big trouble. So recently he paid attention to everything, avoiding stealing Ai Zhixin's limelight. Whether third person present or not. Like today, regarding this decide to levy or not, what principle to levy. If in past when Ai Zhixin asked first sentence he would say. But now he felt better let Ai Zhixin open mouth first. Just didn't expect this guy jumped out saying first before leading two sentences. Grandma's, more tired than acting in old timeline. Wang Qiyi felt deep helplessness.

"But levy, cannot copy Lingao model." Ai Zhixin saw Wang Qiyi looking thoughtful, thinking he was still worrying about ideas. Started telling his own belly plan without waiting him to open mouth. "Heavy tax is inevitable. I plan applying two prongs. Based on strictly implementing Lingao 'Yellow Ticket,' first strictly strike various private prostitutes, hidden prostitutes and that whatever one-building-one-phoenix small nests. These people mostly do this trade for livelihood, and health risk is huge, hard to manage. Now Guangzhou city has so many jobs, places recruiting female workers plenty too. Treatment not worse than selling body. Force them out to work."

"Right, logic is this. But this isn't what our Finance and Tax Bureau can do. Involves law enforcement problem."

"I communicated with Liu Xiang before. Other Guangzhou Senators especially Dr. Lin and their Health Mouth approve extremely. Catching directly to labor camp to work. Remolding a few years send back to Lingao to solve marriage problem... Grand Magistrate Liu happy, Senate also happy."

"That good that good." Wang Qiyi put on look of washing ears to listen respectfully.

"This second is levying heavy tax on Wind Moon Venues [Brothels]. Regardless what items inside, all levy high uniformly, compressing their profit space. Now personnel flow free; they dare not transfer all these to prostitutes, otherwise people all run. If raising fees, can whole Guangzhou Wind Moon Field be supported by a few big households? Even surviving finally, casual check still fine? Sealing auctioning, Purple Light Pavilion taking over, logical and natural. During this period estimate many prostitutes come out to work long ago."

Ai Zhixin's words made Wang Qiyi dumbfounded. For a moment he felt opposite sitting was a furry bear, authentic one.

"What do you think?" Long speech finished Ai Zhixin held urge to smoke, drank a big mouthful like ox. Girl aside immediately filled cup obediently.

"Is this easy to manage? We don't know details of those Wind Moon Venues. Even wanting High Levy no standard."

"Ask Pei Xiuli. She has that whatever Master's concubine said to be Thin Horse [trained courtesan] background. This bit of thing clear as door. Besides last time Police Bureau did Custom Industry Rectification, those women all signed contracts. Also many 'actively moved closer to organization'—Mass foundation exists. Just ask them to write materials, still fear can't grasp specific situation?"

"Also true." Wang Qiyi thought. "I feel Lingao Yellow Ticket system quite good."

"Correct. Also mandatory physical exam. Unqualified not given Yellow Ticket. So our Fubo Army soldiers go with relieved heart. Otherwise causing something in army is fatal. Totally only 20,000-plus people, how precious." Ai Zhixin didn't know why Wang Qiyi suddenly went back mentioning Yellow Ticket. But he approved this system much.

"I feel, since Guangzhou also wants to implement Yellow Ticket. Anyway every prostitute must check, otherwise not given ticket..." Wang Qiyi moved body closer to Ai Zhixin. "Why not levy a sum together when Health Mouth gives them check?"

"Mm? Good idea Old Wang!" Ai Zhixin suddenly enlightened. "Isn't this replica of Insurance Company and Vehicle Management Office collecting Vehicle and Vessel Tax..."

"Hehehe, all cars all cars..." [Pun on driving/sex]

"Old Wang, this isn't your style."

"Don't fuss, am I normal man or not?" Wang Qiyi unfolded notebook again. Ai Zhixin glanced, seemed to be what he said just now. Instantly felt very satisfied. "I feel we can make big article on Yellow Ticket. Because Wind Moon Venue hard to control, but Yellow Ticket easy to control. Check is simple too. Can distinguish without reading words. No ticket directly labor camp. We can also make a reporting system. I remember time ago Grand Magistrate Liu hired labor 5 cents daily. Then reward 5 cents for reporting one without Yellow Ticket once. Think, meeting one without Yellow Ticket, this whoring need not pay money and get bonus..."

"Old Wang you truly are not commonly bad,哈哈哈. But one code returns to one code. Renege heavily debt is not to be encouraged. Money still to pay. But confiscated as 'Illegal Income' after payment. Speaking of which your measure and striking hidden prostitutes etc. can combine together. Need not do one thing twice."

"Let's raise this Yellow Ticket audit fee. Roughly raise to level where general girls in bigger Wind Moon Venues only have enough to eat full after paying fee..."

"Old Wang, you are... persimmons pick soft ones to pinch specifically."

"This is natural. How much cost needed for Wind Moon Venue management? This Yellow Ticket audit anyway Health Mouth must do. Adding our procedure, basically zero cost collection. Besides, you hit board on those Madams, those meat-selling women may not feel pain. Yellow Ticket is board hitting on themselves... Company losing 10 million and you losing 100 yuan, which hurts you?"

"This way heart will think, should change industry instead of changing company." Ai Zhixin thoughtful. "Ay wrong, Old Wang, then those Hangyuan [High-end Brothels/Courtesan Houses] how you plan to handle?"
