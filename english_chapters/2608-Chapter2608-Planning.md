# Chapter 2608: Planning

Hearing the voice, the two stopped and looked up and down at the young man in old-style clothing before them.

The little girl walked to Zhang Jiayu's desk, couldn't help but lean closer to look carefully again, saying, "Really handsome. I didn't expect Teacher Zhang to like this type."

"Hening, children shouldn't speak without restraint," the leading woman said to the girl, half amused and half scolding.

"Yes, Chief," Zhao Hening replied with a pout, as if acting coquettishly.

Zhang Jiayu was startled, not expecting the leading woman to be a Senator.

At this moment, Huang Xiyin happened to withdraw. A few minutes later, Zhang Xiao also walked out holding a document. Seeing the two women, he smiled and said, "Sister Yao'er, Hening, you came at the right time. Go inside and sit first."

Zhang Xiao then said to Zhang Jiayu, "Jiayu, take this document and go to the County Police Bureau."

Ancient county yamen jails were set in the Kun position outside the magnificent gate southwest of the main hall, commonly known as "South Jail." The Senate's system was vastly different from the Ming Dynasty. Although the municipal and county governments occupied the county yamen, they obviously wouldn't set up detention centers and prisons inside the county government; the police bureau was also set up separately.

Zhang Jiayu took Zhang Xiao's instruction and dared not delay, going out towards the Lingxi Circuit Yamen, where the Nanhai County Police Bureau was located. Heroes have had a hard time passing the beauty trap since ancient times. At his age, Zhang Jiayu inevitably felt attracted to a youthful girl like Zhao Hening. He even subconsciously looked back when he went out.

Entering the police bureau, Zhang Jiayu found the staff in the hall, showed the temporary work badge given by Zhang Xiao, and successfully met the Director of the Nanhai County Police Bureau. This naturalized director carefully flipped through the document handed over by Senator Zhang. According to the Senate's system, administrative detention was generally seven days, not exceeding fifteen days at most. The reason he kept the person without releasing was that the people below were unclear about the Senate's wind direction. After all, writing rebel poems was a matter that could be big or small. Since Magistrate Zhang had given instructions, he quickly signed and handed it down, saying to Zhang Jiayu, "Chief Zhang instructed to release Kuang Lu. Please reply to the Chief that I have arranged it."

Thus, Zhang Jiayu's simple task was successfully completed. He walked with his head down while thinking. At the entrance of the police bureau, he happened to crash right into someone, and both retreated a few steps. Zhang Jiayu looked closely and saw it was actually his sworn brother Zhang Mu. He was very happy and prepared to say hello, but a flash of surprise crossed Zhang Mu's face, then acting as if he didn't know him, he apologized and turned to leave.

Zhang Jiayu chased after him. After a few turns into an unmanned alley, he unexpectedly found Zhang Mu waiting for him with a smile.

Zhang Jiayu said, "It really is Brother. Why did you refuse to recognize me just now?"

"Haha..." Zhang Mu said, "Zhiyuan, you bear heavy responsibilities. What kind of place is the Australian police bureau; how could I dare to recognize you?"

Zhang Jiayu suddenly understood; this sworn brother Zhang Mu was indeed an old hand in the *Jianghu*. He said, "Brother is right. It's just that ordinary people avoid this police bureau like the plague; what are you doing here?"

"It's a long story. You know I returned home not long ago, but many old friends have passed away. Recently, I learned that a good friend, Kuang Zhanruo, also returned home from north of the Ling. I was intending to invite him for a drink and a happy chat, but when I arrived in Guangzhou, I heard from his family that Zhanruo was detained by the Australians. His family has sent people to the police bureau many times, only getting a reply of 'no bail allowed.' Sister-in-law is a woman and inconvenient to go out, so she entrusted me to test the Australian wind direction again."

Zhang Jiayu asked, "Is the Kuang Zhanruo Brother mentions Kuang Lu?"

Zhang Mu was a bit strange. "Zhiyuan knows him too?" A rich young master like Kuang Lu shouldn't have any intersection with a commoner a full twelve-year cycle younger like Zhang Jiayu.

Zhang Jiayu said, "Brother doesn't know. I went to the police bureau just now to deliver Chief Zhang's instruction to release Kuang Lu. If Brother goes to the detention center now, you can just pick him up to go home."

Zhang Mu didn't quite believe his ears. "Zhanruo wrote emotional poems on the wall of the Zunjing Pavilion in the County School. The Australians released him so easily? Also, Zhiyuan, how did you mix into the side of the Australian magistrate?"

Zhang Jiayu said, "That's also a long story."

Zhang Mu didn't have time to talk in detail with Zhang Jiayu, and it wasn't convenient for Zhang Jiayu to go to the detention center with Zhang Mu, so the two parted ways after discussing business.

When Zhang Mu walked into the detention center, before seeing Kuang Lu's face, he already heard his bragging voice with the Australian guard from afar.

"Do you know? I once studied at Mingfu Cave on Luofu Mountain. There is a plum blossom tree on the mountain planted thousands of years ago, incredibly huge."

"Bragging without a draft. I don't believe it." Guard A looked at Guard B.

"I don't believe it either. How big can a plum blossom tree of thousands of years be?" Guard B said.

"I know. Once when it bloomed, I wandered under the tree. A gust of wind blew, and petals fell one after another, burying me two or three *zhang* deep. I struggled hard, crawling more than thirty *li* in the sea of flowers before I could straighten my waist, and another thirty *li* before I could stick my head out. Since then, my mouth, nose, and belly have been full of clear fragrance, so I never get sick..."

"Kuang Lu, you can go." A policeman from the detention center came over and interrupted Kuang Lu's bragging, saying to him.

Kuang Lu, half-lying on the bed, didn't quite believe it and said, "Not keeping me anymore? I haven't stayed enough yet. There's food and drink here, carefree, and people listening to my stories. Where can I find such a good place?"

The policeman continued, "Of course it's not that simple. If you want to go out, you have to pay Councilor Huang 10 yuan for medical expenses and apologize publicly in the newspaper. Also, for scribbling on the library wall and damaging public property, compensation is 5 yuan."

Hearing that he not only had to pay that dog thief Huang Xiyin but also apologize publicly, and a wall was worth five yuan, simply unreasonable, Kuang Lu said angrily, "Then I'll stay here and won't leave, won't leave..."

At this time, a sentence floated from outside, "Addicted to living here? Aren't you afraid of your 'Shuoren's' Lioness Roar?"

Kuang Lu was startled in his heart, thinking secretly: *Who else knows the nickname I gave my wife?*

Footsteps approached. Kuang Lu looked closely. "Iron Bridge!"

Zhao Hening was the first orphan taken in by Zhao Yingong in Hangzhou. At that time, she was a seven or eight-year-old child, abandoned on the bridge surface due to illness, her face yellow and swollen, hair disheveled and face dirty, naked in the cold wind of March, with pus and yellow water flowing from some places on her body, looking both filthy and disgusting. Seeing her hanging by a thread but still having some vitality, Zhao Yingong felt compassion, wrapped her in a blue wool cloak and took her back. Under Zhang Yingchen's careful treatment, she finally survived.

During the days at the Hangzhou Station, Zhao Hening formed the "Seven of God" with six older children over twelve: Donghua, Xihua, Funing, Furong, Lizheng, and Yanhe. Under the guidance of Zhao Yingong and Li Yao'er, they excellently completed the task of new-method silkworm raising. However, because she was too young, she was soon transported back to Lingao and entered the "Initial Class" of Fangcao Di to study with the Little Senators.

The students of the "Initial Class" were mostly the generation of Little Senators who came with their parents, bringing their own seats and knowledge of the old timeline. They could be said to be the generation of leaders connecting the past and future of the Senate, the top priority of the Senate's education cause. Therefore, technical Senators like Zhang Xiao, who graduated from well-known universities in the old timeline, were often forcibly assigned teaching tasks in the early years when Fangcao Di's teaching staff was seriously insufficient. He spent a lot of time with these students and knew them very well.

Seeing Zhang Xiao, Zhao Hening was a bit excited. "*Sensei*, your rank rose really fast! You have to cover me in the future."

Zhang Xiao replied jokingly in Sichuan dialect, "Little Sister, your mouth is still so sweet. What place did you get in the exam?"

"Oh my, you really mention the pot that doesn't boil!" Zhao Hening blushed a little. She enrolled later than others and was a child from a poor family with no cultural foundation. Although she could be considered diligent and hard-working, her grades had always been the tail-ender kind compared to the Little Senators in the Initial Class. However, during her days in the Initial Class, influenced by what she saw and heard from the Little Senators, she gradually grew from a self-abased, silent girl lacking security into a lively, cheerful, and understanding sunny girl.

Seeing Zhao Hening grown into a graceful and charming young lady, Zhang Xiao sighed, "I didn't expect that in a blink of an eye, the little girl from back then has grown into a big girl. Time really flies."

"Cough cough..." Li Yao'er pretended to cough, reminding, "Let's talk about business first."

Zhang Xiao came back to his senses and said, "Right, long story short. I invited you here this time to prepare for a trip to the grassroots. I haven't been in office for long, nor is it short. Now the matters in the city are roughly clear, but the countryside outside the city, to me, is still shrouded in the fog of war. I must make a trip personally. So I thought, since that's the case, why not bring everyone from the medical, agricultural, and educational sectors? If there is anything, we can discuss it together and handle it on the spot; high efficiency."

"Good, I also wanted to go to the countryside of Nanhai to see if there is a suitable place to promote the new sericulture method." Li Yao'er had previously hit a snag promoting silkworm raising in Xiangshan County; hitting the south wall, she naturally turned back.

"What ideas do you have? Why not tell us first?" Zhang Xiao said.

Li Yao'er said, "Guangdong's silkworm eggs are no good, and the sericulture technology is no good either. Native silk not only has low yield but also poor quality. According to the experience of the old timeline, improvements must be made from the source. But relying on the few of us fighting alone won't work. There must be an institution continuously outputting talents and technology to play a promotional role. So I plan to find a suitable place to build a Sericulture Technical School."

Zhang Xiao's idea coincided with Li Yao'er's. "Besides the sericulture school, there should also be fishery, animal husbandry, and planting. It's better to jointly run a Nanhai County Agricultural Technical School. As for school funding, the preliminary idea is to take it from the tax revenue of local related industries, and the Ministry of Education allocating a little more will be enough."
