# Chapter 382 - The Nanbao Highway

Wu De returned to the Executive Committee meeting room: "It'll be twenty days before delivery now! Wu Nanhai will certainly have objections."

"Objections won't help. From Nanbao to Bairren—by ancient standards it's quite far, and Nanbao itself is hilly with bad roads." Ma Qianzhu studied the map for a long while. "Let's just advance next year's planned simple highway to Nanbao. Temporary emergency requisitions can make villages deliver, but for long-term resource utilization, we absolutely need a highway."

The Nanbao region was where Lingao's mineral resources concentrated: lignite, limonite, peat, kaolin, limestone, plus Li territory agricultural and forestry resources and tungsten ore. All had significant practical value for the transmigrator collective's industry and agriculture. But due to long-term poor transportation, plus a Ming garrison town near Nanbao, connections with the collective were weak. To date, only the Reconnaissance Team, Bandit Suppression Detachment, and trade caravans to Li territories had visited. A highway would greatly benefit local resource utilization and strengthen ties with Lingao's Li territories. Currently, due to poor roads, trade caravans only visited Nan Cave every two or three months. Li territory resources couldn't be fully utilized, and infiltration control was insufficient.

"I support the highway." Wu De said. "Otherwise such requisitions becoming routine would be extreme exploitation. I frequently contact local elders—I sense common people most fear endless labor conscription. I understand—in rural areas, able-bodied men are most precious. A family without men is like the sky collapsing. With a highway, travel becomes convenient; vehicles can transport materials, improving efficiency."

By modern standards, Nanbao wasn't far. From Bairren City, following the Wenlan River upstream along S306 highway, passing through Lingao county town, continuing south into hilly terrain—soon you'd reach modern Nanbao Township. Under 31 kilometers total. Only a 20-30 minute drive, but in this time-space, it took two or three days. Over wilderness dirt paths, having villages deliver coal by carrying poles and wheelbarrows—the labor consumption was imaginable.

He rang the bell on his desk. A young boy of fifteen or sixteen appeared at the office door. He wore a black native-cloth mandarin collar student uniform, with a wooden entry-pass badge on his chest.

"You called, Chief?" The boy was respectful, speaking slightly halting Mandarin.

"Summon the Transportation People's Commissar and Construction Company Manager to my office." Ma Qianzhu said authoritatively.

"Right away, Chief!" The boy gave a solemn nod, turned, and walked out.

Office etiquette training was going well. Ma Qianzhu admired the hierarchical formalities in Soviet films' leadership offices—serious, formal, radiating Soviet meticulousness.

The boy was named Hou Wenyong, an orphan collected with his sister by the Guangzhou station. Since both had decent educational foundations, the sister had joined the Health Department for nursing training. Hou Wenyong quickly passed the Grade B diploma exam at Citizens' School. The General Office happened to need reliable administrative trainees for various departments. After passing Political Security Bureau vetting, Hou Wenyong was admitted to the Military-Political Academy, studying at school three days weekly and working at the Planning Committee three days.

Transportation People's Commissar Shan Daoqian was at the Bo-pu rail dispatch center, racking his brain designing railway interlocking schemes. Bo-pu's rail network was quite dense; relying on crude flag signaling alone was too inefficient.

Being suddenly summoned to the Planning Committee office surprised him. Transportation matters had been light lately—mainly maintaining and upgrading existing roads.

Ma Qianzhu saw both had arrived and presented his concept for the Bairren-Nanbao simple highway.

"Too hasty." Mei Wan found it abrupt. "The rainy season just started. Continuous rain makes road-building very difficult. Why not wait for dry season?"

"The highway's purpose is transporting Nanbao's mineral resources." Ma Qianzhu said. "Currently Nanbao has resources we urgently need that just can't be moved!"

"If the Executive Committee agrees, we in Transportation have no objection." Shan Daoqian's specialty was railways, but he could manage highways. He studied the map: "The outbound cargo is mainly minerals?"

"Correct."

"Approximately how many vehicles per day?"

"Uncertain." Ma Qianzhu said. Nanbao's mineral development potential was great, but current extraction capacity was unclear.

"For bulk cargo transport, our most reliable vehicles are ox carts." Shan Daoqian calculated. "I'll need to order new heavy-load wagons from Li Chiqi. Ox numbers are also insufficient."

"For oxen, contact External Trade Committee—they now manage Changhua Fortress. Have them purchase another batch from the Li—Changhua Fortress itself still has some cattle."

"Alright."

"Road surface requirements aren't high for this type." Mei Wan said. "But Nanbao is hilly terrain—the road may have severe elevation changes. Heavy-load wagons may not manage."

Ma Qianzhu said: "Nanbao is hills, not mountains. No need for tunneling and rock-blasting on such a massive scale. At most some detours—try to make the road surface as level as possible."

"Let me check how the 20th-century S306 highway from Lingao county town to Nanbao Township was routed." Mei Wan flipped through his work notebook. "I'll organize a survey team upon returning." He recalled something else:

"There's a Patrol Inspector station near Nanbao, specifically inspecting traffic in and out of Li territories..."

"No problem—that inspector is very sensible." Ma Qianzhu indicated no concern. "After the peace agreement with the county, this inspector got his share of benefits. He's never bothered our Li territory trade caravans. Road construction shouldn't bother him either."

"There's also the garrison town discovered in mission 221629050705."

"The garrison town's location is relatively remote; the highway can avoid it. Though it needn't avoid it by much—handle it like the county town." As Chief of Staff, Ma Qianzhu knew the place's status and sneered at this so-called military fortress's combat capability. "They'll just hide in their walls. I say assign this road-building mission to the Army. If the garrison's Ming troops are uncooperative, we'll simply 'reorganize' that garrison town."

The Bairren-Nanbao simple highway was thus decided. Wu Nanhai and the Agricultural Committee didn't yet know their farmland development had butterfly-effected into many subsequent events. The Agricultural Committee was now concentrating on Meitai Yang water infrastructure construction while strengthening late-stage management of February's first rice crop, aiming for spectacular yields in test fields—building momentum for subsequent Heaven and Earth Society agricultural promotion.

By modern Lingao's accumulated temperature, rice could be planted in January of the Gregorian calendar. But Wu Nanhai, being cautious, followed local farmers' habits and delayed sowing to February—wisely so, as January had seen extreme lows of 3-5°C.

Rice seedlings required temperatures above 10°C. Though lacking full-year Lingao temperature data, Wu Nanhai judged: 1629 Lingao could probably only manage two crops. The first crop's insufficient heat accumulation would delay harvest to May-June; the shorter second crop could harvest around October. This matched what he'd heard from farm workers. Clearly this time-space's Lingao had good reasons for not growing three crops.

February's first rice sowing covered 500 *mu*: 200 *mu* of last year's improved, well-fertilized high-yield test fields; another 300 *mu* of so-called "rain-dependent fields." On these 300 *mu*, besides hybrid rice seeds, Wu Nanhai experimentally planted several dwarf lodging-resistant varieties to see what results they could achieve without modern agricultural inputs.

After sowing—without herbicides, chemical fertilizers, or pesticides—entirely traditional methods. Wu Nanhai and Fa Shilu spent every day in the paddies, constantly exchanging farming insights with Wang Tian and their workers, devising various homespun solutions to emerging problems.

Growing crops without modern agricultural inputs was initially quite painful for Agricultural Committee members accustomed to modern farming. None had truly foreseen how great the petrochemical agriculture that environmental bourgeoisie loved to criticize actually was.

Where 50 kg of chemical fertilizer per *mu* once guaranteed high yields, now each *mu* needed half a ton of base fertilizer plus multiple follow-up applications. Growing 200 *mu* of high-yield fields nearly exhausted Wu Nanhai's accumulated fertilizer from most of a year—leaving the other 300 *mu* severely underfertilized.

Then came weeds, rice rust, blast disease, pest infestations... every rice growth problem appeared before them. Issues easily solved with modern technology became heavy labor here. Until the Chemistry Department manufactured calcium chlorate, weeding was done by hand under Wang Tian. For pesticides, they searched the Great Library for traditional formulations, set up a workshop for compounding—trying one after another until problems were eventually overcome.

Now the grain-filling period was ending. On Wan Lihui's suggestion, paddies began draining for field-drying. Drying reduced lodging, decreased pest damage, hardened the ground surface, and facilitated harvesting—very beneficial for yields. But timing required skill—judging the right moment was precisely the core farming cadres' most crucial task. The Wan family had grown rice for generations; Wan Lihui had considerable experience.
