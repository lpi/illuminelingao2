# Chapter 1253 - Heavy Reward

The First Squadron made slight corrections and rest, beginning to sail along the southwest coast of Xiamen Island at 1:00 PM, pressing straight for Zhongzuosuo City.

Zhongzuosuo City was on the southwest coast of Xiamen Island, backed by Wulao Mountain, facing Gulangyu across the sea, roughly the location of present-day Xiamen University. To the east of the walled city was the famous Huli Shan Fort—many Senators had visited this place out of admiration: the 280mm Krupp cannon up there was a "divine object" in the hearts of many military enthusiasts.

Because this place guarded the key waterway between Gulangyu and Xiamen Island, known as the "Gateway of Eight Fujian, Key of Southern Sky." The location was very important, so Zheng Zhilong also built a fort on Huli Shan, mounting several shipboard 24-pound cannons bought from the Portuguese.

By standards of the time, the defenses of this Huli Shan Fort were not crude. Although there were only three or four guns and less than a hundred garrison soldiers, the defense level of the contemporary Humen Fortress was also very low. Compared to Guangdong bureaucrats, Zheng Zhilong had more insight into coastal defense, so he had invested quite some capital on Xiamen Island.

Although its range was limited, difficult to threaten First Squadron ships sailing at sea, it was a trouble after all. Especially since the guns on Huli Shan Fort could reach the beach where the First Expeditionary Force expected to land. Thus, this fort had to be destroyed before launching the landing battle.

The First Squadron sailed past Huaixin Rock, then designated targets and began shelling.

The specific coordinates of Huli Shan Fort had been marked and surveyed by Special Recon beforehand, so the 130mm guns straddled the target after only a few trial shots.

The 130mm cannons bombarded slowly and rhythmically to save shells—the accompanying supply ships hadn't arrived yet; main gun shells on all ships were down to one-third of the loadout. Fire and dense smoke shrouded Huli Shan. Through binoculars, one could see the fort collapsing gradually in smoke and dust; rubble and gravel flew sideways. With each impact, Special Recon observers reported the impact point via radio, *Lichun* notifying all ships via flag and light signals. Under several volleys, the camp stockade and fort on Huli Shan, once forests of flags, were already annihilated in smoke and fire.

According to Special Recon reports, besides the fort on Huli Shan, Xiamen Island had several other forts, but none were significant to their operation. After destroying Huli Shan Fort, Zhongzuosuo City located by the sea was left completely without cover. They could act at will.

The First Fleet sailed safely past Huli Shan Fort. Then all ships dropped anchor. Ming Qiu ordered: "Commence landing."

The landing spot was chosen on the beach in front of Huli Shan Fort. This place was about two kilometers from Zhongzuosuo City. Choosing here was to avoid entering the anchorage near Zhongzuosuo: many ships were currently anchored in the anchorage; warehouses and depots were on the dock. Natural conditions for fire attacks existed.

Once the Zheng family set fire to the dock and anchorage, the entire front of Zhongzuosuo would become a sea of fire; the Army and Navy could only run for their lives together.

Whistles sounded on deck. Sailors opened grating skylights on deck. Shouts of Marine NCOs came up. Marines stifled below deck for most of the day began coming up on deck sequentially, boarding according to order.

They squeezed up ladders, exited hatches, milled around outside hatches for a minute before organizing, waiting for orders to board boats. Small boats and supplies were placed everywhere on deck, extremely crowded; they could only walk slowly along the deck.

Davits driven by steam engines began squeaking and creaking, lowering small boats to the sea surface. Net ladders were hung down both sides of the ship's hull.

Whistles urged the Marines. A voice on deck kept shouting, "Boat Fifteen boarding!" "Boat Three boarding!"...

With every shout, a platoon of soldiers tremblingly climbed over the bulwark, climbing down net ladders on both sides. Everyone carried heavy backpacks, helmets, and new rifles. Assault engineers carried even more; no one wanted to sit in the same boat with them because they always carried explosive charges.

Li Huamei helped maintain order by the gunwale. Marines passing her always looked curiously at this rare female officer. Female soldiers were rare in the Fubo Army—neither Army nor Navy had their own medical systems, so military hospitals absorbing the most female soldiers didn't exist. As for another concentration of female soldiers, the communications troops, current Fubo Army communications were still based on human courier communications, demanding little for female soldiers—only in Army and Navy headquarters were there relatively more female military personnel.

A seagoing female officer like Li Huamei was unique. Fortunately, she had sailed her own ship to sea since girlhood, having plenty of experience commanding a group of men. She definitely wasn't a little girl who blushed at men's gazes. She was accustomed to such scenes; otherwise, thinner-skinned women would probably have the heart to jump into the sea.

She kept a straight face, shouting occasionally for them to "Watch your feet!" "Safety first!" Absolutely no pleasant expressions. So many landing craft on the ship, lowering and boarding order and speed varied. Some already full of troops were circling around the big ship, people inside waving to the big ship. Light black hulls, blue seawater in the dawn. Transfer was also happening on the *Yangbo* not far away; another landing boat was entering the water. Davit pulleys squeaked occasionally. The gunwales were covered with transferring soldiers like ants.

Li Huamei turned her gaze to look north toward Zhongzuosuo City again. She felt some disapproval in her heart—this place was very close to Zhongzuosuo. Now all ships had dropped anchor and were busy transferring soldiers; the sea surface was a scene of chaos. She looked up at the wind vane: wind direction was still headwind... If the Zheng family seized this opportunity to launch a fire ship attack, her side would probably fall into a bitter battle...

She was suddenly startled. She actually regarded the Hair Rebels as "her side"! This reminded her again: she was still currently undercover status. Her heart couldn't help but be apprehensive.

At this time, Zheng Zhilong observing on the gate tower of Zhongzuosuo City put down his Dutch telescope. His brow smoothed slightly, like a national champion player catching a fatal error by the opponent: The Hair Rebels actually anchored and lowered small boats in front of Huli Shan—needless to ask, they wanted to land. But this place was less than four *li* by sea from the anchorage where his fire ships were moored. Releasing dozens of fire ships still moored in the anchorage with the wind at this opportunity, presumably they didn't have the skill to weigh anchor and escape so quickly—at worst, they could annihilate most of the small boats put into the sea, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy land force. Even if they couldn't repel the Hair Rebels just with this, at least they could delay for half a day or a day.

Looking up at the Zheng character flag on the gate tower, he asked in a deep voice: "How is the wind?"

The generals crowding around him understood his intention. However, after Zheng Lian's complete defeat just now, leading fire ships to attack was already an extremely risky assignment. Win or lose, it boded ill.

After a slight silence, someone stood out and bowed to request orders: "Wind direction fits exactly! This general is willing to lead a team of fire ships to annihilate the enemy!"

The crowd looked closely; the general volunteering was Zheng Zhipeng—Zheng Zhilong's clan cousin, a sworn brother of the original "Eighteen Chi," the core of Zheng Zhilong's direct line. In this autumn of urgent survival for the Zheng family, if one of their own didn't stand out, it could neither convince the crowd nor reassure Zheng Zhilong.

"Good, I leave it to you." Zheng Zhilong nodded, eyes revealing appreciation. "I give all fire ships to you, and send others to lead ships behind to support you. Take care!"

"Willing to go through boiling water and tread on fire for Big Brother, declining not even ten thousand deaths," Zheng Zhipeng said loudly, stepped back a few paces, turned, and went quickly down from the tower.

"Order the supply depot to quickly send fifty thousand taels of silver to the dock, for General Peng to reward the fire ship sailors," Zheng Zhilong ordered. "First reward twenty taels per person. For those who ram enemy ships, reward another fifty taels upon return!"

The generals were stunned. Twenty taels per person! This wasn't a heavy reward; it was simply inconceivable. Normally, winning a battle only rewarded four or five taels. One had to have combat merit or be "wounded" to be rewarded over ten taels—this was already extremely generous among various armed forces at the end of Ming, let alone the beggar-like government troops. Now rewarding twenty taels to these fire ship sailors before they even went to sea was too incredible.

"Yes..."

"Also tell the supply depot to send three hundred thousand taels to display by the gate tower. I want to heavily reward the three armies! Officers and soldiers going out of the city to attack, reward ten taels each; those defending the city five taels each! As long as Hair Rebels are repelled, reward another fifty taels each! Those killed in battle, besides pension, will be rewarded the same!"

Another commotion among the generals.

Zheng Zhilong's fourth brother Zheng Zhibao couldn't help stepping out to admonish: "This, Big Brother... isn't it too heavy... Once this opening is made, if there aren't such heavy rewards in the future, soldiers won't be willing to exert effort in fighting..."

"Now is exactly the time for everyone to sell their lives. Is seventy taels of silver worth buying a life? I think it's very worth it!" Zheng Zhilong said. "If we lose the battle and lose Zhongzuosuo, the silver in this city will just benefit the Hair Rebels anyway!"

Rather than suffering such a cowardly defeat, giving a city full of treasures and goods to the Hair Rebels for nothing, better to scatter it to buy hearts, fight to the death; maybe there's still some chance.

"...Keep the green hills, don't worry about no firewood. As long as we brothers stand firm on this Xiamen Island, even if men and ships are all spent, we can still turnover!" Zheng Zhilong said loudly. "A thousand gold scattered will come back again. We brothers do big things; we must have some boldness!"

Incited by his words, the generals felt hot blood rushing up one after another. Feeling since Big Brother regarded wealth as grass, they needn't worry about personal gains and losses. As long as they fought desperately to drive away the Hair Rebels, they wouldn't worry about lacking chances to win back everything—after all, back then they were once forced almost to a dead end by Li Kuiqi. Later they turned it over all the same. The generals bowed together:

"Willing to follow General's lead!"
