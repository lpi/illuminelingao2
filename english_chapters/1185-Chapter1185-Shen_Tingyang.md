# Chapter 1185 - Shen Tingyang

Shen Tingyang had long been on the radar of the Great Library and Zhao Yingong. This wasn't just because he was a famous figure in the late Ming, but more importantly because of his sand junk guild background.

Personal information on Shen Tingyang was scarce, but from the fact that he was a National University student, could fund the construction of sand junks for sea transport out of his own pocket, and could immediately produce a hundred large ships when the Ming fell—all this indicated the Shen family was a wealthy maritime shipping clan. Consider that each of those large ships cost at least one to two thousand taels of silver in the late Ming. Calculating from his memorial to the Hongguang court, mentioning his hundred ships capable of carrying 200 soldiers each, the total asset value of just these water-transport ships alone was over 100,000 taels of silver. Plus the Shen family couldn't possibly only have these ships—they certainly had many smaller vessels too. Additionally, following the common practice of late Ming wealthy merchants, they would have purchased large amounts of land, opened shops, and run various enterprises. Adding it all up, the Shen family's total assets would be at least 500,000 taels.

The Shen family weren't ordinary big merchants. Shen Tingyang had once had connections with Hong Chengchou. After his capture, Hong Chengchou had even tried to save his life. This showed Shen's background wasn't too low—the Shen family weren't ordinary wealthy merchants but likely had dealings with high officials in the court.

This kind of merchant, well-connected in official circles, possessing large amounts of capital and ships, was an excellent proxy to use against Zheng Zhilong.

The problem was, he had to persuade this Master Shen to cooperate with him. On this front, through his contacts with the Revival Society and especially his promotion of the grain tribute sea transport proposal, he had won Zhang Pu's favor and gained a modest reputation in Jiangnan literati circles. The assessment that "Manager Zhao of Hangzhou's Wanbi Bookstore has learning of practical application" had spread far and wide—along with his bookstore's "Australian style" and many novel products and books, he had become a hot topic among Jiangnan literati. So before sending someone to express his hope of visiting Shen Tingyang, he already had sufficient confidence that he wouldn't be turned away at the door.

It seemed that in any timeline, if one wanted to do great things, one needed some fame. Otherwise, even if you harbored world-shaking skills, most would just take you for a madman—and a Bole was hard to find.

If the External Intelligence Bureau and the Colonization and Trade Ministry hadn't set up this bookstore beforehand to let him "cultivate his reputation," any thought of accomplishing something in Jiangnan would have been unthinkable.

All the way there, Zhao Yingong had been considering how to persuade Shen Tingyang. From historical records, Shen Tingyang was someone quite capable of getting things done, and he had considerable achievements in maritime shipping: he had the technology and was willing to take risks. He was born in 1594 and was now in his prime, not yet forty—at the peak of a man's physical and mental energy. He should have quite ambitious ideas about undertaking great enterprises.

Zhao Yingong knew that directly persuading Shen Tingyang to get involved in Japan trade probably wouldn't work—after all, it was too big a move, and to people of that time it would seem like gambling. So he decided to bring up, several years ahead of schedule, the suggestion that Shen Tingyang himself would make in history: converting grain tribute from canal to sea transport.

Shen Tingyang's ability to propose this to the court showed he had clearly been considering and planning it for many years—which was why he succeeded on his first attempt. If he raised it now, the other party would surely respond quite positively. Moreover, Zhang Pu was also very interested in converting grain tribute to sea transport. As a Jiangnan scholar, Shen Tingyang could hardly be uninfluenced by Zhang Pu.

Once they succeeded just once, Shen Tingyang's trust in him would increase. Then the likelihood of him agreeing to the Japan proposal would be much greater.

Zhao Yingong pondered all the way, and the sedan chair gradually approached Chongming County town.

Chongming Island's history as a seat of government was short. It was only in the Yuan Dynasty that a state city was built on Yaoliu Sandbar, establishing a prefecture—Chongming Island's first administrative seat. Later, as Yaoliu Sandbar continued to erode southward, the seat of government was relocated twice northward. In the second year of Ming Hongwu, Chongming was downgraded from prefecture to county, and the seat moved from Yaoliu Sandbar first to Sansha, then to Pingyang Sandbar. In the sixteenth year of Ming Wanli, Chongming's administrative seat finally moved to Changsha Town, which would become the site of Chongming County town ever after.

In this timeline, Chongming County was under the jurisdiction of Suzhou Prefecture, so when Shen Tingyang died for his country, he was listed in Suzhou's Hall of Five Hundred Worthies. He was from Xinhe Township in Chongming County, and his residence wasn't in the county town. But Zhao Yingong had already received word from a servant sent by the other party, inviting him to meet at a villa outside the county town.

Due to its geographical environment, Chongming Island had highly developed shipbuilding and shipping industries, especially Yangtze River and coastal shipping. Ancient Chongming's shipbuilding and waterborne transportation were very advanced. The Chongming sand junk—suited for navigating among shoals and sandbars—had originated from Chongming and become famous throughout the nation. Along the way, many shipyards could be seen near the docks outside the county town, with hulls of sand junks under construction standing on wooden frames along the mudflats. The coastal docks bristled with masts, with many sand junks of various sizes at anchor.

Zhao Yingong knew: sand junks had flat bottoms, especially suited to the many shoals and sandbars in China's coastal and major river waterways. They weren't afraid of running aground, highly adaptable to docks and channels, and because of their flat bottoms, their holds had large effective volume and carrying capacity—a very economical and practical coastal cargo vessel. At the same time, they had decent ocean-going capability.

Shanghai was the main construction site and shipping port for sand junks. In the Qing Dynasty, Shanghai had over five thousand sand junks, with annual throughput of two million tons. The British demand to include Shanghai among the open ports after the Opium War wasn't simply about its geographical advantages.

Zhao Yingong had conducted some prior research on Shanghai's maritime shipping industry: though the late Ming sand junk guild wasn't as massive as in the Qing, it still had over a thousand vessels. These sand junks sailed along the coast each year between Tianjin and Shanghai, transporting large quantities of civilian cargo.

The Shen family itself operated sand junk maritime shipping. Converting grain tribute to sea transport was no problem for him. Presumably the Shen family had always hoped to undertake the court's grain tribute sea transport operations and recapture the glory of Zhu Qing's direction of northern grain shipment in the Yuan Dynasty.

Thinking along these lines, the sedan chair was already being carried into the Shen family villa's sedan hall. The chair was set down and the armrest removed. Zhao Yingong emerged slowly from the sedan chair with a smile on his face.

Waiting to receive him was a young man around twenty years old—probably one of Shen Tingyang's sons or nephews. He wore a student's blue robe, had a respectful manner, and spoke courteously. He led him all the way to the main hall.

Shen Tingyang was already waiting in the hall. This Master Shen was a National University student. Late Ming National University students were often there through imperial favor or purchase—just a way to get scholar status. Zhao Yingong estimated Master Shen's situation was similar—for a great household like the Shens, obtaining a studentship was easy.

This Master Shen appeared about thirty-seven or thirty-eight, handsomely featured, with dark skin and a solid build—clearly a weathered man, not a frail bookish scholar who had read himself to weakness in his study. By his looks, he had probably been to sea and sailed ships himself.

His manner was bold, his movements imbued with a chivalrous spirit. His Chongming dialect, though not loud, was crisp and decisive. Zhao Yingong couldn't help feeling more confident about this visit.

Meanwhile, Shen Tingyang was also sizing up Manager Zhao—whose name he had long admired. Not only was the Wanbi Villa's reputation like thunder in his ears, but he had also heard that Zhang Pu regarded him highly. Shen Tingyang wasn't exactly a member of the Revival Society, but Zhang Pu was practically the leader of Jiangnan scholars. Anyone Zhang Pu valued, he naturally regarded more highly too. Moreover, this Manager Zhao apparently had no ordinary relationship with the Xu family of Shanghai. Jiangnan literati even rumored that Sun Yuanhua—in-law to the eldest son of Elder Xu's family—had escaped disaster this time partly due to Manager Zhao's efforts on his behalf.

All these factors together made Shen Tingyang very much look forward to Zhao Yingong's visit—what could be Manager Zhao's purpose in coming to see him of his own initiative?

Whatever his purpose, making the acquaintance of such a personage was something Shen Tingyang found quite interesting.

The two exchanged greetings, took their seats as host and guest, and were served tea. They naturally went through the usual pleasantries of "long-admired your great name" and such before gradually getting to the point.

Zhao Yingong steered the conversation to the malpractice of grain tribute transport that he had discussed during his recent visit to Zhang Pu, then brought up the topic of "abolishing canal tribute for sea transport"—relating the contents of his discussion with Zhang Pu in full. Of course, through his artful phrasing, the idea became a case of "great minds think alike" rather than coming from his own suggestion.

Sure enough, this topic immediately scratched Shen Tingyang's itch. As Zhao Yingong had guessed, Shen Tingyang had always harbored deep interest in grain tribute sea transport. He had long focused on the tribute transport system as a major state affair. He hoped to emulate his local predecessor Zhu Qing of the Yuan Dynasty, shipping southern grain to the capital by sea, thereby saving the court enormous tribute transport costs. Shen Tingyang understood the court's current fiscal difficulties very well—eliminating the expenses of maintaining the Grand Canal and the tribute boatmen would be extremely attractive to the Emperor.

His predecessor from the same hometown, Zhu Qing, had shipped tribute grain from Liujiagang in Taicang using sand junks built in Shanghai. The first year alone he transported 40,000 shi of grain, and at the peak he shipped three million shi annually, with losses so small as to be negligible. There was no need to expend endless manpower and resources dredging and maintaining the canal, or supporting a huge, inefficient fleet of tribute boats and tribute soldiers.

His considerations included not only political ambitions but also practical interests. The Shen family was the largest sand junk operator at the Yangtze estuary. If grain tribute were converted to sea transport, the enormous shipping fees would be quite enticing.

For the past several years, Shen Tingyang had been studying Zhu Qing's sea routes, trying to work out a route that was both fast and foolproof—after all, tribute transport was a major state affair that couldn't be handled carelessly.

But he was after all from a merchant family, with a very nimble mind. He immediately understood that this was a serenade intended to win his support: this Manager Zhao had come to see him with precisely this scheme in mind!

This Manager Zhao was truly exceptional! Shen Tingyang was a man of "chivalrous spirit." Knowing well that this matter faced enormous difficulties only made him more interested in the challenge.
