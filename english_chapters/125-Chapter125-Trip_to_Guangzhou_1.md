# Chapter 125 - Trip to Guangzhou (1)

Xiao Zishan returned from Guangzhou.

Going to Guangzhou was not to sell things and earn silver; on the contrary, they were a standard "purchasing group to Rams City (Guangzhou)." They carried a purchasing list with many items. Every department listed what they urgently needed, among which the largest item was pig iron.

Hainan has the best and largest rich iron ore in China, but neither Tiandu nor Shilu could be developed by the transmigrators for the time being. Moreover, for Hainan to be a coal-iron complex, there was a quite fatal problem—it had no coal.

The rise of an industrialized country is often crucially related to the establishment of a coal-iron complex. Britain could become the first country to enter industrialization, which had a lot to do with possessing abundant iron ore and coal mines simultaneously. The United States had the uniquely endowed Great Lakes, not only with matching resources but also convenient and cheap water transportation. Russia had the Urals; Germany had the Ruhr. In the past, the Executive Committee only understood these literally. When they truly arrived in Lingao and attempted to establish an industrial system, they realized that if the steel problem could not be solved, industrialization was just empty talk. They transported complete sets of equipment, various machine tools, various measuring tools, built power generation equipment, and produced cement, but were trapped by the steel problem. Without the cheapest coiled steel bars, they couldn't even make a common reinforced concrete floor slab, a steel nail, or a hammer. There were tons of steel ingots piled on the ship, but they were all special steels they couldn't produce in a short time—no one was willing to use them.

After discussion, several main group leaders of the Industrial Committee decided that since the development of iron ore could not be achieved for a while, they would skip the blast furnace stage and make steel first! Regardless of quality, refine the crude steel most needed daily. The large amount of pig iron required for steelmaking would be attempted to be bought from Guangdong first.

Pig iron can not only be used as material for steelmaking but is also a good material itself. Some relatively rough and heavy components can be made of pig iron. The purchase list issued by the metallurgy group was to buy 50 tons of pig iron. It was said to be the bare minimum. With the few small converters they brought, even if only the smallest one-ton capacity converter started working, 50 tons of pig iron wouldn't be enough for a month's production.

This plan was completely feasible on paper. The output of pig iron in Guangdong during the Ming Dynasty was extremely considerable. Based on the statistics of iron tax by the Guangdong Provincial Administration Commissioner in the thirteenth year of Jiajing (1534), the annual output was calculated to be 6,127,500 jin, equivalent to 3,100 tons. 3,100 tons of pig iron is only a few days' output of a small steel plant in modern times, but the total steel output of Russia in 1670 was only over 2,700 tons. The transmigrators' early steelmaking industry established on the basis of importing pig iron still had certain guarantees.

(Note: The figures for steel production are currently highly controversial. This is purely for the needs of the novel, don't be serious.)

But for Xiao Zishan, things were not that simple. Although he knew nothing about steel, he still knew economic history. In Guangdong Province of the Great Ming, there was probably no iron smelting field with 50 tons of ready-made pig iron available for purchase. Nine out of ten, it had to be collected from everywhere. After collecting it, how to transport it out? Xiao Zishan vaguely remembered that pig iron seemed to be forbidden for export. If he loaded 50 tons of iron onto a ship, what would happen if the government knew? This was enough to give him a headache.

Headache aside, things that should be done must be done. The task of this purchasing group, besides buying things, also included preparing to establish a Guangzhou intelligence network and infiltrating rich merchants and even the government in Guangdong. Therefore, the personnel allocation was strong enough. Besides him as the general person in charge, originally Xi Yazhou was to be sent along as a military specialist, but later because he couldn't get away from mobilizing the masses in Salt Field Village, Bei Wei was transferred from Salt Field Village instead. Xiao Zishan thought this was good too. With a scout as a bodyguard by his side, he felt safe going anywhere. Bei Wei also brought the four best students from the reconnaissance team, using this trip to Guangzhou as the graduation examination of their training.

Accompanying the team were also several figures preparing to open a forward station in Guangzhou. Yan Maoda was a jewelry company manager in the past, particularly familiar with this industry. His suggestion to the Executive Committee was to use existing real estate facilities in Guangzhou to open a trading firm specializing in luxury goods as a cover stronghold—this kind of trading firm had several major advantages: First, it required huge capital and frequent transactions. Huge cash and frequent flow of personnel were not easy to arouse suspicion; second, the contacts were all family members of high officials and noble lords, easy to infiltrate the enemy's interior; third, it could be heavily guarded in a grand manner.

Lu Rong joined the group just after returning from the Li area. He was proficient in multiple southern dialects, loved reading ancient texts like "Guwen Guanzhi" and "Selections of Literature" on weekdays, and could write passable brush calligraphy. Physically strong, skilled in horsemanship, and knowing some martial arts, he was a suitable candidate to be stationed on the secret front.

Another important figure was Guo Yi. The main reason he was entrusted with heavy responsibility was that the group's concept of secret front work all came from movies and novels, and he was the only one who had truly touched practical work. With a transfer order, Guo Yi suddenly found that he was no longer an odd-job person in the Public Security Group but became the person in charge of the forward station, going to conduct espionage activities in Guangzhou City of the Great Ming—this made him feel somewhat the impermanence of life. Less than three months ago, he was conducting counter-espionage in Guangzhou City of another time and space...

Besides more than a dozen transmigrators, some natives were needed to accompany them. The people of the Bairen Beach production team who had returned sporadically were either Lingao locals or Fujian Shegeng people (migrant farmers). Let alone Guangzhou, many hadn't even been to Qiongzhou Prefecture. Among the captives caught after breaking Gou Family Stockade, there were some from Guangdong, but they hadn't passed political review yet, so they dared not use them rashly. Finally, a breakthrough was found from Salt Field Village.

Tan Guihuang, deputy director of the Salt Field Village Committee (the director was of course his cousin Tan Guiqiong), heard that the Short-hair Masters were looking for a few reliable people to go to Guangzhou together, so he recommended the salt merchant Liu Gang from Leizhou to them.

Because of the salt trafficking relationship, Liu Gang was very familiar with Salt Field Village. When Tan Guihuang crossed the sea to contact salt merchants to buy salt, he was the first to come and also brought grain and cloth urgently needed by the village at that time. Tan Guihuang felt this person valued loyalty and was reliable. Moreover, although he settled in Leizhou, he was a native of Nanhai County, Guangzhou Prefecture, and often went to do business around Guangzhou, familiar with the road conditions. It couldn't be more suitable for him to accompany them. When Tan Guihuang spoke to Liu Gang, he naturally agreed readily—he couldn't refuse even if he wanted to; he still wanted to continue the salt trafficking business with Salt Field Village. He also got the news that this group of short-hairs was the backer of Salt Field Village, and it was they who finished off the local tyrant Gou the Elder who controlled the salt field. A salt merchant accustomed to traveling the world naturally dared not offend such a force.

The means of transportation was a ship, not only the fastest and most convenient, but this team also brought quite a lot of things. Besides essential dry rations, weapons, and silver money, there were items needed for building the Guangzhou intelligence station such as radios, hand-cranked generators, and solar panels. There were also various samples of goods prepared to find opportunities to sell in Guangzhou—the disposal of stolen goods that the Gou family failed to complete was now their turn to handle.

However, the ships owned by the transmigrators were too eye-catching. No matter which one was sailed over, it would cause a sensation. It was better to keep a low profile for the time being. So they asked Tan Guihuang to come forward and buy a Lingao Tuofeng (trawling wind) boat from a local fishing owner. This boat was 22 meters long with a displacement of up to 78 tons, an out-and-out large fishing boat. Running to Guangzhou for short-distance trade was a piece of cake.

(Note: Lingao Tuofeng is a famous large traditional fishing boat in Hainan, but its appearance era is relatively late.)

With a ship, sailors were needed. Ordinary people couldn't handle such a large sailing ship. Such talents were hard to find among the transmigrators. Although Wu De came from a fisherman background, he grew up watching motorized sailing boats. Finally, Lin Chuanqing volunteered to be the captain. This smuggler snakehead from a fisherman background could tinker with any job on the sea due to work needs. Several sailing enthusiasts from the North American detachment immediately became sailors.

The North American group hadn't got any positions since arriving in Lingao. Because Qian Shuiting was in investigation and statistics, he was assigned to deal with numbers in the Planning Committee. Qian Shuixie and Zhou Weisen served in the military group, standing guard every day, bored out of their minds. They were unlike Lin Shenhe, who could hang out in the machinery group engaging in weapon R&D after work every day. When sailors were recruited for the trip to Guangzhou this time, they all signed up, treating it as a pastime. Several people also had their own little calculations, bringing a lot of their privately stored weapons, and dragging Lin Shenhe along, preparing to do some pirate business on the sea. Lin Chuanqing wasn't a benevolent man either. They hit it off instantly, preparing to act as soon as there was an opportunity.

However, doing pirate business was still a bit difficult. The Lingao Tuofeng was a hard-sail boat, while the sailing skills of this group of 21st-century sailing enthusiasts were for soft-sail boats. Although they roughly mastered the usage after several sea trials, how proficient they were was hard to say. After discussing for a while, they went to tell Xiao Zishan that for ease of operation and safety—after all, the coast of Guangdong was not peaceful—it was best to turn the ship into a motorized sailing boat. The North American group knew Committee Member Xiao was the most cautious person and cared about his own safety very much, so this suggestion was approved by him immediately. The industrial group was allowed to modify this hard-sail big ship, adding two 12-kilowatt single-cylinder diesel engines produced by Changchai. The industrial department brought many of these things. Its structure was simple, maintenance convenient, and usage extremely wide. Except for not being an aircraft engine, almost anything could use it as power.
