Chapter 15 Servants (1)

"Name?"
"Zhang Xing."
"Age?"
"Eighteen."
"Origin?"
"Xiangshan County."
"Why sell yourself?"
"Family... family has no food..."

In the courtyard of the secret house, a "recruitment" disguised as buying servants was underway.

Unlike ordinary buying of servants, the Transmigrators not only looked at the physical condition, but also conducted a simple "interview" with each bought servant.

Lin Baiguang sat behind a table with a notebook spread out in front of him, recording the information of each servant.

He asked very carefully, including family background, past experiences, skills, and even temperament and hobbies.

"Why ask so clearly?" Steward Yan watched from the side, confused. In his opinion, buying servants just meant looking at whether they had strength and were obedient. Who cared about their background?

"This is called 'file management'." Lin Baiguang said without raising his head, "Only by understanding them can we use them better."

Through questioning, Lin Baiguang roughly classified these servants.

Those with some skills (such as carpentry, masonry, cooking) were assigned to the logistics group.
Those who were physically strong and somewhat martial were assigned to the security group.
Those who were clever and articulate were kept by his side as intelligence assistants.
Young women were assigned to do laundry, cooking and cleaning.

Among these servants, a young man named "Wang Si" attracted Lin Baiguang's attention.

Wang Si was twenty years old this year. He was dark and thin, but his eyes were very spirited. He claimed to have worked as a waiter in a restaurant and knew some characters.

"Do you know characters?" Lin Baiguang handed him a book, "Read a paragraph."

Wang Si took the book. It was a "Three Character Classic". He stumbled and read: "Men at their birth, are naturally good. Their natures are similar, their habits become distant..."

"Not bad." Lin Baiguang nodded, "Where did you learn it?"

"I... I used to eavesdrop outside a private school when I was young." Wang Si lowered his head, somewhat embarrassed.

"A teachable talent." Lin Baiguang wrote a "A" in the comment column of Wang Si's file, "From now on, you follow me."

"Yes, Master!" Wang Si was overjoyed. Following a master who valued culture was much better than doing rough work.

Besides buying people from the human market, Guo Yi also entrusted Master Gao to help find some professionals with special skills, such as accountants, shopkeepers, craftsmen, etc.

These people were generally free citizens and would not sell themselves as slaves easily. They needed to be hired with high salaries.

Master Gao recommended an old accountant named "Zhang Youfu".

Zhang Youfu was in his fifties, wearing a pair of presbyopic glasses, holding an abacus in his hand all day long. He had been an accountant in a big firm in Guangzhou for decades and was very familiar with business rules and accounting methods.

Guo Yi interviewed him.

"Mr. Zhang, how do you keep accounts?" Guo Yi asked.

"Returning to the manager, the old man uses the 'Four-column Balancing Method'." Zhang Youfu replied confidently, "Old balance + New receipt - New disbursement = Present balance. Clear and distinct, no mistake at all."

The Four-column Balancing Method was the mainstream accounting method in ancient China, which was quite advanced.

Guo Yi nodded: "The method is good, but our firm has a new set of accounting methods. Are you willing to learn?"

"New method?" Zhang Youfu was stunned. He had kept accounts for a lifetime, what method hadn't he seen? Could these Australians have any unique skills?

Guo Yi took out a form printed with "debit" and "credit": "This is called 'Double-entry Bookkeeping'. Every transaction must be recorded in two accounts at the same time, with debit on the left and credit on the right, and debit and credit must be equal..."

Guo Yi briefly explained the principle of double-entry bookkeeping.

Zhang Youfu listened with a frown at first, then his brows gradually relaxed, and finally revealed a shocked expression.

"Wonderful! Wonderful!" He slapped his thigh, "This method is rigorous and ingenious, preventing fraud and mistakes. It is simply a magical skill for managing money!"

"Are you willing to learn?"

"Willing! Willing! Even if I have to pay tuition, the old man is willing to learn!" Zhang Youfu looked at Guo Yi with admiration.

In this way, the "Finance Department" of Guangzhou Station was established. Zhang Youfu became the first local employee.

With the addition of servants and employees, the framework of Guangzhou Station was gradually enriched.

However, management problems also followed.

These people had different origins and complicated habits. Some were lazy and slippery, some liked petty theft, and some liked to gossip.

"We must establish rules." Guo Yi said at an internal meeting, "State has state laws, house has house rules. Without rules, nothing can be accomplished."

So, a "Code of Conduct for Employees" combining modern corporate management systems and ancient family rules was released.

The code stipulated the daily schedule, work discipline, reward and punishment system, etc. in detail.

For example:
- Get up at 6 am, assemble for roll call.
- Not allowed to go out without permission during work.
- Not allowed to reveal the firm's secrets.
- Rewards for good performance, deductions of wages or corporal punishment for violations (the Transmigrators didn't want to use corporal punishment, but in this era, simply deducting money was sometimes not deterrent enough).

In order to let these illiterate servants understand the rules, Guo Yi also specially organized a "study class". Every night, a team member would explain the rules to them and teach them to recognize simple characters and numbers.

This measure of "training" servants was unheard of in the Ming Dynasty.

At first, the servants found it fresh and funny, but soon they discovered that these "Australian masters" were serious.

A servant who stole food was caught, publicly criticized, deducted three days' food, and locked in a small black room for reflection.
A servant who worked actively was praised and rewarded with a piece of meat.

Under the distinct rewards and punishments, the atmosphere of the servants changed completely. They became disciplined, diligent and capable.

Master Gao looked at all this and admired the "Australians" even more in his heart.

"These people manage the family like managing the army. Their ambition is not small!"
