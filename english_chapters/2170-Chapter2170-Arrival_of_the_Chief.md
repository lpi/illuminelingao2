# Chapter 2170 - Arrival of the Chief

The officers present fell silent. "Sound east, strike west" was easy to understand. Right now, they could infer that the "East" where the enemy was making noise was Yu'nan County seat. So where was this "West"?

Looking at the map, there were over a dozen county seats and important fortified nodes along the West River alone. Each node was defended by at least one squadron of the National Army—these were soldiers from the first mobilization, whose equipment and training were on a completely different level from the second batch of emergency supplementary mobilized troops. none of them would be easy to crack. Without concentrating five or six times the defenders' strength and equipping a considerable number of firearms, it would be impossible to take these nodes.

The Fubo Army implemented a system of divided responsibility on the West River. Within a certain area, if news came of a siege or a large gathering of enemies, troops from various strongholds attached to that zone would sortied to fight. Troops from other zones generally would not join the battle unless redeployed by headquarters.

Therefore, if the enemy's "Sound East" target was Yu'nan, then their real objective should be the various strongholds upstream and downstream centered on Yu'nan County.

Among these strongholds, Fengchuan County was the most attractive target. It was a transportation node leading to the He River, where the Logistics Department had set up a depot and hospital with large stockpiles of supplies. But this place was clearly a hard nut to crack. Let alone a mob of gathered bandits, even regular Ming official troops would not fare well attacking it.

As for the counties downstream of Yu'nan, the most valuable was Zhaoqing. But compared to Fengchuan, Zhaoqing was the seat of the West Guangdong Forward Command and the 1st Brigade Headquarters—an even harder nut.

"Since the enemy wants to concentrate forces for a big operation and use the 'Sound East, Strike West' stratagem, their goal obviously won't be just taking a small stronghold or an obscure county seat. And their strategy is to incite bandits—Yu'nan County is just bait to attract bandits to sell their lives," Mi Longtao stated his deduction.

"What the commander says is extremely true!" Zhu Si quickly agreed.

Li Shenggang didn't express an objection either. In his view, this was just correct nonsense in the "opening remarks." He nodded slightly.

"But in terms of the bandits' military quality and operational capability, this key point can't be Zhaoqing, nor Fengchuan," Mi Longtao said. "I personally speculate that the most likely place is Wuzhou!"

At the mention of Wuzhou, Zhu Si immediately shuddered.

Wuzhou was located at the very forefront, close to the Ming army that had retreated to defend Guangxi. Once the defenders were maneuvered out and the interior left empty, it wasn't impossible for the Ming army to mass heavy troops for a counterattack—moreover, Xiong Wencan urgently needed a great victory right now: recovering Wuzhou would sound much better than recovering Yu'nan County.

"In that case, our company should return to defend Wuzhou as soon as possible..." Zhu Si felt a hidden fear of this increasingly perilous situation. Here, the Wuzhou Composite Company often had to operate independently under field conditions, which was too much pressure for him—he often felt "inadequate to the task."

Back in Wuzhou, with Qian Duo as the backbone, he wouldn't have to shoulder much responsibility. He didn't believe for a moment that the Ming army could take Wuzhou—Wuzhou was the largest city in West Guangdong. Not only was Qian Duo's company in the city, but a battalion of the Fubo Army led by Zhu Quanxing was also outside the city. Although its specific location was unknown, it certainly wasn't far from Wuzhou. Though on the front line, the safety factor was actually very high.

"In my view, Yu'nan County isn't just a simple 'Sound East'; it's very likely being truly besieged." Li Shenggang spoke up. Unlike Mi Longtao, his expression was very serious; he rarely engaged in small talk and had quite an imposing manner. "The Ming army's plan is likely to use bandits as cannon fodder to attract our forces—after all, the greater the pressure on Yu'nan County, the greater the likelihood that the Forward Command will draw troops from Wuzhou and other places to reinforce it. So the enemy will definitely commit considerable strength to attack Yu'nan County. The pressure we face won't be small at all. It's not suitable to divide our forces for now."

Mi Longtao expressed agreement.

Zhu Si had nothing to say in response, so he could only express "resolute obedience to the assignment."

The meeting decided that the whole force would return to Fengchuan the next day. Half of the Wuzhou Company would remain stationed in Xugang for a few days, responsible for training the local militia. A portion of the captured firearms and weapons would also be left to the locals—this glorious yet troublesome task naturally fell on Li Dong's head.

"Xugang is a relatively large village in this area with a large population. Now many refugees from other places have poured in. You must seize this opportunity to build up the militia—right now, there's only the Xu family's private militia, which won't do."

Zhu Si understood perfectly; the Chiefs were most taboo about clan powers. Right now, the Xu family was a force for maintaining social stability and had to be utilized fully, but the matter of "gradual transformation" could be started. Naturally, doing this wouldn't be easy, but fortunately, it was decided that Li Dong would stay behind, leaving him relaxed.

The next day, after leaving behind fifty soldiers of the Wuzhou Company's Right Detachment commanded by Li Dong and various firearms at Xugang, the rest of the troops left Xugang and returned to Fengchuan County.

"This is clearly Yu'nan County's territory; why are we stationed here?" Watching the black smoke of the boat fleet fade away in the distance, Luo Mao couldn't help grumbling.

Li Dong couldn't figure it out either, but he said, "Stop grumbling, it's an order. If you're told to garrison, you garrison. Come on, let's inspect the defenses first."

As soon as Mi Longtao's boat docked, the vice company commander who had stayed behind brought him shocking news.

Bei Wei had come to Fengchuan!

It wasn't rare for a Senator to be in Fengchuan County. Personnel from Logistics, Navy, Reconnaissance Bureau, Intelligence Bureau... they came and went in an endless stream. Some were passing through, some came for inspections, some for specific missions, and some worked locally—for example, Senators from the Health Department took turns on duty at the field hospital in Fengchuan County.

As the Garrison Commander of the Guangdong Region and the General Captain of the National Army Guangdong Region, Bei Wei had also been here more than once to coordinate the security mechanism of the occupied areas. After the Yao rebellion and the comprehensive bandit riots along the river, he came here even more frequently.

But this time the arrival of the Senator was quite different. The vice company commander said that besides Bei Wei, there were seven or eight other Senators with him, some in uniform, some in plain clothes.

"...The Chiefs arrived at night on gunboats and moved directly into the headquarters upon arrival, seeming unwilling to have their arrival discovered," the vice company commander whispered.

"What instructions do the Chiefs have?" Mi Longtao asked hurriedly.

"Major General Bei Wei wants you to see him as soon as you return."

"Good, I'll go right away."

Mi Longtao went to the Garrison Command together with Li Shenggang. The area here was very large. Several Eight Immortals tables were pieced together to form a map table. Bei Wei was currently standing by the map pondering. Besides him, there was a Senator in plain clothes—Mi Longtao recognized him: this was Chief Xu from the Intelligence Bureau.

This Chief Xu was very mysterious, arriving quietly and leaving quietly. Sometimes he would summon him to ask about some situations, sometimes he would hold meetings with soldiers, cadres, and local common folk.

He spoke very little, mainly listening to others. Then he would ask various questions specifically. Mi Longtao never dreamed of what use asking some of those questions would be. But adhering to the principle of "don't ask what shouldn't be asked," he never inquired, only reported according to requirements.

Looking carefully again, he saw several reed mats spread out on the floor of the headquarters, displaying various weapons. Mi Longtao recognized at a glance that these were the enemy weapons captured in yesterday's battle, including even a "Nest of Bees" rocket launcher and wooden cannons.

Researching captured enemy weapons was Chief Xu's consistent work, so Mi Longtao didn't find it too strange.

"Report—" Just as Mi Longtao shouted, Bei Wei had already seen them. He nodded slightly, signaling them to come over.

"Report on yesterday's battle situation first," Bei Wei said. "Start from the beginning."

"The earliest situation occurred during the transport of the Wuzhou Composite Company. It would be more appropriate for Lieutenant Zhu to report first," Mi Longtao said.

Bei Wei nodded, his gaze shifting to Zhu Si.

Zhu Si gave a crisp salute and began to report on the battle situation starting from leaving Wuzhou City. He had served in the Garrison Battalion for many years and had been in close contact with many Senators while on duty, so he had none of the nervousness and constraint typical of ordinary naturalized soldiers meeting a Senator for the first time. Not only was his speech fluent, but his report was concise and to the point. Bei Wei was very satisfied listening to it.

"Good report," Bei Wei sized up the National Army lieutenant standing ramrod straight before him. "You speak the New Language very well. Where did you learn it?"

"Report to Major General Comrade, in the Lingao Garrison Battalion!"

Bei Wei thought to himself, no wonder his military bearing and discipline were so standard! That report just now won his favor. He asked about which year he enlisted and his service record, thinking with some regret that his combat experience was a bit lacking!

However, judging from the report just now, his on-site command wasn't bad either. And Mi Longtao didn't show any expression of "disagreement" during his report; perhaps it should be said he even wore a look of "approval."

It seems he's a talent worth molding, Bei Wei thought. However, his experience is still too little. Appointing him as the Wuzhou Battalion Commander was indeed a bit aggressive. This bandit suppression operation could exercise him fully. This basically solidified his determination to form a mobile detachment centered on the troops Mi Longtao commanded yesterday.

Subsequently, Mi Longtao and Li Shenggang reported yesterday's battle situation and the conditions along the route one by one. They also marked the relevant battle locations on the glass plate over the map.

"It seems the enemy really has big moves in Yu'nan County," Bei Wei said to Xu Ke.

The intelligence that bandits were going to "do something big" in Yu'nan County was issued by Xu Ke. Of course, he didn't have spies lurking among the bandits, government troops, or Yao strongholds. He reached this conclusion mainly based on the collection of relevant battle reports, prisoner confessions, and traces of enemy activity.

"The bandits you encountered have considerable combat power," Xu Ke said, pointing at the various weapons on the reed mats. "How could bandits afford such weapons? Even the Great Ming's official troops are no better than this!"
