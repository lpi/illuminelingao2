# Chapter 384 - Micro-Loans

"The difference is huge." Wu Nanhai explained. "Landlords actually come in many types. The landlords we're familiar with mostly exploit through tenancy—they divide land into small plots for tenants. According to traditional Chinese landlord-tenant relationships, once land is leased, what and how to grow are the tenant's business. As long as tenants pay rent, landlords have no right to interfere with farming activities. Sometimes they even lose the power to change tenants. So they have zero interest in improving agricultural technology—their energy goes to dealing with tenants and ensuring timely, full rent payment."

"By contrast, entrepreneurial landlords have a flavor of modern agricultural capitalists. They hire long-term and short-term workers, paying wages. Some are even tenants themselves, so they have strong demand for high land profits—since they can't simply raise rent to profit, they must extract more output from the land. Their demand for agricultural technology is more urgent."

"Tenants? If they're tenants, how can they be landlords?"

"Hehe, didn't you know during land reform there was a term 'tenant-rich-peasant'? Actually calling such people landlords is inappropriate. They're professional land operators, generally possessing substantial capital or specialized skills, leasing large areas directly from landowners and profiting by cultivating high-value cash crops."

"I see." Wan Lihui nodded, somewhat embarrassed. "And I'm from a farming background—"

"Hehe, the rural society you came from was long past this stage." Wu Nanhai said. "In this time-space's Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangsu-Zhejiang, entrepreneurial landlords are now rising—though they mainly grow cash crops. Pure grain-focused entrepreneurial landlords are rare. We want to support them."

"Entrepreneurial landlords are very capitalistic," Ye Yuming said. "Representatives of advanced productive forces in this time-space, yes?"

"So our agricultural policy is: support entrepreneurial landlords, protect owner-cultivators, squeeze out tenant-landlords, gradually making them disappear or transform into entrepreneurial landlords."

"What about tenants? Eliminating tenant-landlords eliminates tenants' livelihood. The Executive Committee isn't planning land reform—how do we solve their land problem? Under tenancy they at least had a way to live. Eliminate tenant-landlords and they can't even get bitter rice to eat?"

"Lingao has plenty of wasteland. Distribute seeds and oxen, help them clear land, organize them to build irrigation..."

Wu De directly objected: "After all that effort, we'd only create a batch of new Lingao smallholders. We don't need to expand the smallholder base here—it's useless to us."

"Sounds fine though—smallholders will fight desperately to defend their land and homes."

"The working class will fight just as desperately, and they have nothing—no thinking about spring planting or autumn harvesting." Wu De joked. "Alright, actually for defending homes, people don't necessarily need fifty *mu* to cultivate—just a society that feels prosperous, stable, and happy."

"As for absorbing surplus labor, there are many solutions. Simplest is industry." Wu De continued. "Then agriculture itself—we don't need peasants, we need agricultural workers. Except for certain crops, everything else gets intensive cultivation on large-scale land."

Wen Desi cleared his throat, about to speak, when Li Quan from the farm entered carefully carrying a tray. This little girl, collected with her mother from Gou Family Village by Zhang Xingjiao, had after most of a year at the farm become quite a cute *loli*, with two black braids, wearing a clean thin silk blouse, large eyes blinking.

"Chief Wen, please have tea," Li Quan said sweetly. Despite her young age, she knew the transmigrator collective's main figures well—these gentlemen were "big shots" who often appeared at the farm.

"Good, thank you." Wen Desi raised the porcelain tea cup. The little girl smiled, then delivered tea cups to everyone. Perhaps because cute little girls were rare, everyone's greedy gazes fixed on her, making the girl blush crimson. She quickly retreated.

Wen Desi coldly "humphed."

"Li Quan is now at Citizens' School. Very clever. Xiao Zishan wrote a recommendation for her—plans to send her to Military-Political Academy..." Wu Nanhai looked around, mustered courage, and said quietly.

"Military-Political Academy? She's too young!" Wen Desi was puzzled, momentarily not understanding Wu Nanhai's meaning.

"In a few years she won't be." Wu Nanhai's face reddened slightly; he seemed reluctant to speak. Just then Ye Yuming began speaking again, so he had to drop it. Ye Yuming was now introducing measures for small farmers and minor landlords.

For this group, the Heaven and Earth Society would mainly promote livestock and poultry techniques through contract farming, with the Agricultural Committee purchasing everything.

This wasn't simply distributing chickens and ducks to households, but a micro-loan operation.

"I suggest Delong Grain Store handle this," Ye Yuming said. "If Delong finds the business too amateur, it can be delegated to the Agricultural Committee..."

"No problem—Delong is a financial institution by nature. Micro-loans are within scope." Yan Ming said. "This is better—easier accounting."

He proposed: during distribution, directly issue Grain Circulation Vouchers. Borrowers use vouchers to purchase poultry from the Heaven and Earth Society for raising. These loans would be small—worth only five to ten chickens.

Households would buy chicks from the Society, raise them, then submit 20 eggs to the Society as principal and interest. The Society would then uniformly purchase eggs at rates of several vouchers per egg. When egg-laying hens aged, they could be sold to the food factory for meat products.

"We can jointly invest with local major landlords in small food processing factories. We provide technology; they manage. Downstream raw materials controlled by Heaven and Earth Society; upstream sales controlled by Trade Department. Even if factories belong to landlords, they're just processing plants—can't cause trouble."

Ye Yuming finished explaining his plan in one breath.

"There's a procedural issue." Wu Nanhai said. "They receive voucher loans but repay the farm with eggs. But the farm can't repay bank loans with eggs."

"I say let it go." Wen Desi said. "Never mind the comparison between in-kind loans and monetary loans. Have you seen poverty-area aid programs? First they distributed cash directly—farmers spent it immediately. Then they switched to distributing chickens, pigs, sheep—taken home and slaughtered within days for eating. They'd claim disease killed them. What do you do—demand repayment?" No one could guarantee this time-space's farmers were more honest than those in the other time-space.

"So rather than loan format, use futures format. Provide quality breeds free first, then contract with farmers to purchase at agreed prices later, paying partial deposit upfront. At least they won't immediately eat the poultry. Also, poultry farming has risks—disease causes batch deaths, easily bankrupting farmers unable to repay, breeding resentment affecting transmigrators' reputation and local social stability. So livestock and poultry farming should be postponed—first popularize quality crops."

"These are micro-loans. I think ten or fewer chicks won't bankrupt anyone. If all die and they can't repay, send them to labor camp for a month as debt payment." Ye Yuming said. "If still worried, have employees' families do the raising first. Besides, freebies will equally be eaten then claimed dead from disease."

"If farmers feel completing the contract benefits more than eating the chickens and drinking the deposit, they'll work properly." Wen Desi shrugged. "Of course, some chronically impoverished people won't think this way. If Lingao's common people are relatively enterprising laborers, contract farming should be implementable. My objection to micro-loans has two concerns: first, locals may lack the concept of borrowing for business; second, loans easily associate with negative things like usury—hard to promote."

"Regarding borrowing concepts, Director Wen, you're overthinking. Lingao's rural lending exists and is quite diverse." Yan Ming had researched this. Local rural small-scale lending was quite common. Farmers often used it for fertilizer and tools, or to survive lean seasons. Lenders were mainly local landlords and wealthy households, predominantly in-kind loans. Interest rates varied widely—from under 1.5% annual interest for mutual-aid lending by local gentry clans to usurious monthly rates of 1%.

"Overall, farmers do have lending awareness. If our loan interest is low, farmers will be willing to borrow. For further risk mitigation, we can develop standards to evaluate clients and implement risk control." Yan Ming was interested in agricultural micro-loans—this would be his first loan operation. Small business, but a beginning.

"That way, we can't increase local farmers' income to win popular support. Poor common folk get nothing..."

"We must balance both." Wen Desi said after careful consideration. "For truly destitute peasants with nothing, no loans. Start lending with small owner-cultivators. Lower standards, broaden coverage, benefit as many as possible."
