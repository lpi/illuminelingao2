# Chapter 563 - On the Ship

Now, this plan had been instilled into the minds of all commanders. Everyone had been trained to follow the plan instinctively, ensuring absolutely no deviations.

However, compared to an opposed landing, they had a substantial advantage—the support from Yulin Stockade. Yulin Stockade's scale was too small to provide adequate logistical support, but it could offer sufficient intelligence. From the day Yulin Stockade was established, Wang Tao, stationed there, had continuously sent reports on local hydrographic, tidal, and weather conditions back to Lingao via telegraph and written dispatches following instructions.

The surveying team had used twentieth-century maps as a foundation to resurvey and create more accurate maps. The Long-Range Exploration Team had surveyed the surrounding water sources and natural resource conditions. Not long ago, a weather forecasting team had also arrived at Yulin Stockade with equipment, attempting to make short-term local weather forecasts.

In terms of intelligence, their preparations were quite thorough. Besides collecting information from Yulin Stockade, they had specifically retrieved all information about the Yulin-Sanya region—hydrology, geography, resources, and local conditions—from the Grand Library's archive. This information was categorized and sorted, then sent to the Planning Council's Project Giant Operations Office.

Now they understood the Yulin region better than any native in this timeline. On the planning maps, where to build camps, where to anchor ships, where to construct a second pier... all had been specifically planned.

Now, the four members of the Sanya Regional Military Committee—still short the Tiandu Mining Bureau director—were waiting for the light of dawn. According to calculations, they would arrive at the Yulin Harbor area right around daybreak.

A signalman knocked and entered, delivering a telegram from Yulin Stockade.

The telegram contained the latest weather forecast: Today in the Yulin area, clear, northeast wind 3-4, sea surface gusts to 5, wave height 1.5 meters. Xi Yazhou glanced at it and said, "Who made this forecast? Where'd he get the basic data? From the Ming Dynasty's weather satellite?"

Wang Luobin said, "This is from the Yulin Stockade weather team. The reliability is quite high." That's what he said, but he had no real idea whether it was reliable or not. Conditions here were even worse than in Lingao. Lingao at least had the weather radar from the *Fengcheng* to use; here they were probably just relying on the kind of "simple weather station" he'd seen in primary school.

"Whether it's reliable or not, we move at dawn. The ship's at the door; we can't not go in." Li Haiping said.

"If we don't get ashore soon, even after we land these three thousand people won't be usable." Zhuo Tianmin groaned. The seasickness was tormenting him badly. "If we can get ashore today, they can still get some rest."

If they didn't execute the landing quickly, the morale and stamina of those aboard would be exhausted. This was a problem the Planning Council and General Staff hadn't anticipated. They had treated transporting personnel like a computer game: people were just numbers. No one had estimated the harshness of long-distance voyages in the age of sail.

Three days after departure, on *Sanya No. 1* and all the other troop transport ships, densely packed hammocks were filled with people groaning from seasickness.

No matter how many days of acclimatization training they'd done, many people still suffered seasickness during the six-day voyage. The smell of vomit mixed with the briny scent of the sea was nauseating. While the ships were underway, seawater splashed through the grated hatch openings; the cabins were perpetually damp, and everyone's clothes never dried. Because there were so many people, going up on deck for fresh air had to be done in rotation—each person got only ten minutes. In this respect, it was actually worse than being on a smaller ship.

The fare was Grassland Series rations: too many people meant the galley couldn't provide hot meals for everyone. Soldiers and laborers could only gnaw on hard Grassland Series naval hardtack—a durable foodstuff made from water, salt, and flour, with an odd taste. But only those who could still eat anything experienced that taste; most people couldn't keep anything down at all.

A few people didn't mind the waves: Hu Wumei and several others were playing leaf cards. He had been officially confirmed as the new mayor of Anyoule Market. Under his command was a migrant contingent of three hundred households.

The mission to lead migrants to Yulin and establish a new township had been discussed with him first. Hu Wumei indicated willingness to go, on condition that he received one thousand *mu* of good land—hill land was fine too, as long as trees could grow on it.

During his short time as estate head at Xuetian Manor, he had shown farm management abilities and ideas that greatly impressed Wu Nanhai. In the original timeline, Hu Wumei was a successful estate landlord. Back in Guangdong, he had grown indigo, raised fish, and planted fruit trees and medicinal herbs in the hills. If not for the troubled times, he could have achieved great things in agriculture instead of becoming a pirate midway through his career.

"Fine," Wu De agreed without hesitation. "I can give you three thousand *mu*, but you must manage it yourself and hire your own workers—you cannot lease it to tenant farmers."

"I don't want tenants anyway. I'll use hired laborers," Hu Wumei said, then suddenly slapped his thigh. "But that Yazhou place has nowhere to hire laborers from..."

"Don't worry, there will be plenty."

Hu Wumei had originally wanted to become a landlord. Now he realized he was going to become an official, and amid his excitement, he felt somewhat apprehensive—he'd never been an official before.

He was assigned to a short-term administrative training class to learn how to manage according to the *Administrative Handbook*. To ensure this former pirate correctly fulfilled his duties, the Civil Affairs Committee also appointed a support team, including a secretary and an accountant. Naturally, there was also a Political Security General Administration work network operative.

Hu Wumei's original followers—relatives and nephews who had been pirates with him, plus extended family who came to Lingao to join him after hearing he'd come ashore—also wanted to migrate to Yulin with him. With a relative becoming an official, how could they not make good use of this opportunity?

But the Civil Affairs Committee didn't approve these enthusiastic "activists"—if they went, wouldn't Anyoule Market just become the Hu Family Village? Replacing Hu Xun with Hu Wumei would be the only difference. In the end, Hu Wumei departed with only his closest relatives—a few households of brothers and nephews.

Sitting across from Hu Wumei was Zheng Ergen. After that heart-stopping night, Zheng Ergen had been arrested. After three consecutive days and nights of interrogation, just when he thought disaster had befallen him, he was suddenly released. Not long after, he was announced as the new chief of Anyoule Market's police station and told to pack up immediately to assume his post.

Accompanying him were several colleagues from the East Gate Market police station. Moreover, everyone received a one-rank promotion. Everyone was puzzled by this sudden transfer. Those with slightly keener minds guessed it probably had something to do with Chief Dugu ordering them to gear up and march toward Bairren City that night.

But whether it was a reward or a punishment remained unclear. If it was a reward, they were being suddenly dispatched from Lingao to the wilderness of Yazhou. If it was a punishment, Zheng Ergen had become station chief, and everyone received promotions and raises.

Though the native policemen couldn't figure out the logic, they knew they had probably been drawn into some conspiracy among the Australian leaders. Being allowed to keep their lives was already fortunate, so everyone was careful with their words and actions, never mentioning a word about that night. When Hu Wumei asked about it several times during cards, Zheng Ergen brushed him off with "I forgot" and "I can't remember clearly," which greatly annoyed Hu Wumei. His card playing also got worse and worse. After four rounds, he had lost both his current month's wages and the next month's.

"Damn it," Hu Wumei cursed, handing over several paper slips serving as chips. "Continue. Continue."

"We can play," Zheng Ergen said, "but no betting."

"What's the point of playing cards without betting?" Hu Wumei grumbled, thinking Zheng Ergen just wanted to quit while ahead.

"I don't want a single one of your coins," Zheng Ergen returned all the paper slips Hu Wumei had lost to him. "If the higher-ups find out I've been gambling, I'm finished." One of the police disciplinary rules was an absolute prohibition on gambling. This was a rule Chief Ran repeatedly emphasized.

"So boring!" Although he'd gotten his wages back, playing cards without money was like fine food without salt to Hu Wumei. Having lost interest, his lower belly felt a bit hot. He thought about taking his concubine for some relief, but this was a ship—nothing but hammocks packed together, nowhere to do that sort of thing.

Lin Gonglao lay in his hammock. His family were boat builders, so naturally he didn't get seasick. But his spirits were at their lowest ebb.

From being "Brother Gonglao" or "Young Master Gonglao" who swaggered around Baitu Village, he had fallen to being an ordinary commune member at Bairren Commune, waking up every morning to the factory whistle to go to work. Those casual laborers from Baitu Village who used to greet him respectfully—now that they'd become formal workers, they paid him no attention at all. This contrast made him extremely resentful.

Lin Xianming had tried several times to get him into the shipyard as a formal worker, but Lin Gonglao's craftsmanship showed no improvement. As the shipyard increasingly adopted mechanical equipment and new production processes, newly trained apprentices surpassed the original handicraft workers in both knowledge and practical skills. Even Lin Xianming's own position was becoming precarious, let alone bringing in his incompetent son.

So Lin Gonglao continued as an ordinary Bairren Commune member. Some restless Lin family members who didn't want to work had gone to enlist in the Security Regiment. Though Lin Gonglao liked to brandish weapons, he had no interest in being an Australian soldier—he thought their soldiers looked stupid, walking and shooting in orderly rows. Besides, he didn't believe the Australians could stay long in Lingao.

The hammock swayed with the ship's motion. The cabin air was foul. Some groaned from seasickness; others had fallen asleep, snoring. Still others were talking and chatting. Lin Gonglao couldn't sleep. He stared aimlessly at the deck beams above his head, unable to understand: why had they suddenly shipped him and many of his clan to Yazhou? Whose damned idea was this? Lingao was at least prosperous. Yazhou—wasn't that the so-called "edge of the world," a place for exiling criminals?

Besides Lin Gonglao and some of his clansmen, the migrant contingent also included some members of the Lu family.

After these two clans had been broken up, the transmigrator collective still didn't trust them. The Lin family alone had nearly two hundred adult males, plus over three hundred children and women—a substantial force in the area. Bairren and Bopu were close together, and Lin family members still occasionally gathered to drink together. During New Year and other festivals, they still held whole-clan activities. The scene of the entire Lin clan gathering to worship ancestors and feast at New Year's Eve this year had put the transmigrators on alert.

The Political Security General Administration's investigation revealed that the Lin family's clan system was still maintained. Lin Xianming and others still had great influence within the clan, and some people were trying to organize the construction of a Lin family ancestral hall. Not only were they actively soliciting within the clan, but they were also heavily promoting "linked lineage" among other families surnamed Lin in Lingao, attempting to expand the clan.

Many Lin family members worked in factories with substantial incomes, enjoying much better economic status than average laborers. Many poor commune members surnamed Lin who had recently arrived in Lingao, still struggling financially, were tempted by the clan's assistance and readily joined the linked lineage.

The most active in this were several of the Lin family's "second generation," including the brothers Lin Gonglao and Lin Gongxun. These two couldn't get into the factory due to their poor skills, remaining ordinary commune members. Harboring resentment, they were particularly enthusiastic about such activities.

The transmigrator collective had always maintained extreme vigilance toward clan power. Wu De, then Civil Affairs People's Commissar, decided to immediately curb and suppress this resurgence of clan organization.

The first measure was a second break-up of the Lin family. The troublesome elements Lin Gonglao and Lin Gongxun became migrants. Lin Xianming was shocked and pleaded through Li Di. Li Di also felt it wasn't quite right to take away both of the man's sons at once, so eventually Lin Gongxun was allowed to stay.

Another batch of Lin family members were relocated—about a dozen households. Some were like Lin Gonglao, unable to forget past glory days; others just wanted to work hard and live a good life. Wu De had specifically spoken with Hu Wumei, instructing him to pay special attention to these dozen households. Additionally, Wu De had sent Wang Sangou—who had once been bullied by the Lin family—specifically to monitor this group.

Several Lu family households were also relocated. On one hand, this was to further reduce the Lu family's influence in Lingao's industrial enterprises; on the other hand, Yulin genuinely needed blacksmiths.

Hu Wumei didn't know all these ins and outs, but over the past few months, he had formed a clear understanding: the leaders' words were absolute imperial edicts—even more fearsome than imperial edicts, because the Emperor didn't know everything, but the leaders knew about everything.

He clearly remembered that among the pirate chiefs who had come to submit to Lingao with him, one had later tried to take his ship and slip away. This matter was discovered by the leaders while still in the planning stage. One day this man was politely summoned, and they recounted to him whom he'd met, what he'd said, and what he intended to do. Then they simply let him go. This pirate chief was completely changed from then on. First, he no longer wanted to command any ship and completely "donated" it to the Australians. Second, he immediately sent all his children into the Australians' schools to demonstrate his loyalty.
