# Chapter 280: Conspiracy

"First, this year's sugar price," Third Master Zhu said, having already thought it through. "We need to push it way down! As soon as their trading house opens for business, we'll set the price at one *liang* five *qian* per *shi*."

Everyone was momentarily stunned. That price was outrageously low. In the best harvest years when sugar prices dropped, one *shi* still fetched at least two *liang* of silver. In poor years, it could go over four *liang*. Third Master Zhu's opening bid of one *liang* five *qian*—right now, even a *shi* of rough brown rice was selling for two *liang*! Wouldn't the cane farmers riot?

"This year's harvest has been average. By the old convention, the price should be two *liang* five *qian*. We've already been buying for over half a month. To suddenly drop this much—how do we explain it? These are relationships built up over many years..." The objection came from Feng Guangfeng, the owner of the "Richangji" trading house. His trading house was relatively small, and Feng Guangfeng wasn't from the Shanxi-Guangdong clique—he was a former clerk who had married his boss's only daughter and become the manager by marrying into the family. He was rather looked down upon here in Haiyi Hall.

Still, his words struck a chord. Business depended on long-term cooperation; both buyers and sellers valued leaving some room. Making this kind of move would create bad blood with the cane farmers.

Seeing everyone hesitate, Third Master Zhu sneered. "It's fine! Everyone knows the South China Sugar Factory produces a lot of sugar now. We'll just say that because they're making so much sugar, the outside market can't absorb it, so prices have dropped."

"Will that work?!"

"Why wouldn't it? If the cane farmers are willing to sell at this price, we make a windfall profit. And besides, we can't be blamed for the price drop—wasn't it South China Sugar Factory that started this? 'Every wrong has its source, every debt its creditor'..." Third Master Zhu's voice got lower and lower as he spoke. But everyone understood clearly. Some silently cheered; others broke out in cold sweat.

"Brilliant!" The manager who had earlier proposed dumping corpses cried out. They could land a blow on South China Factory without openly tearing up relations—leaving room to reconcile if needed.

"But there's a risk," the elderly man said. "They're opening a purchasing operation precisely when the Guangzhou market is good. If they go up to three *liang* a *shi*, they won't be losing money. If our price is low and theirs is high, won't we just be pushing all the stock into their hands for free?" He had been worrying all along that the South China Factory would start purchasing.

"No problem." Third Master Zhu was very confident. "All of Leizhou's three counties produce over two hundred thousand *shi* of sugar in a normal year. If South China's price is high, naturally all the sugar will flow to them. But do the math: say they buy a third of it. That's at least a hundred thousand *liang* of silver. Where are they going to find that much cash? And with the world so chaotic these days, would they dare transport that much silver to Leizhou? When they run out of money and want to stop buying, it won't be so easy. We're the only ones in Leizhou with large amounts of cash on hand. Squeeze them tight with interest rates—even if we can't kill them, we'll make them bleed!"

Everyone thought this plan was workable: the amount of sugar normally consumed by all twenty-one trading houses was now being dumped on South China Factory alone. They'd choke on it.

"It's better to be safe than sorry." The old manager was still worried. "What if they really dare to ship in the silver? What if they've already prepared the silver? Missing a season's worth of purchases is a minor matter—just one year's profit gone. What I fear is ruining our reputation from now on..."

Hearing this, the various managers thought he had a point and began to waver. Third Master Zhu saw the old man's endless dithering and said coldly, "You want to do something but fear this and fear that! The way I see it, best do nothing at all. As long as South China Factory is buying, we'll buy too. We'll get seventy or eighty percent of the business anyway. If they want to ship their sugar out, let them go ahead."

This sounded like he was washing his hands of it. Some of the sharper ones knew he probably still had more tricks up his sleeve. So everyone said they would go along with the plan. Only then did Third Master Zhu continue.

"Second, starting today, whenever you're out talking to people, drop some hints about South China Factory. Understand? You can't bad-mouth them directly, but the meaning should be there: for example, those big iron rollers, and that chimney—things no one's ever seen before. As the saying goes, 'When things go against the norm, there must be demons.'"

Everyone thought this ploy was pretty vicious. But given their monopoly profits, this group—though proper businessmen—were no saints. They'd participated in murder and arson before.

"Finally," Third Master Zhu said, "each year we usually take two percent off the top. This year, of that two percent, one percent must go to Haiyi Hall. I don't mind working for everyone for free, but my people who run around need to be paid, and digging up information costs money. The public coffers only have four or five hundred *liang* in them right now. Not enough."

The managers all looked pained when they heard this. This so-called two percent rule dated back to when cane farmers had consigned sugar to the trading houses for sale. It was a handling fee. Though they'd since switched to cash purchases, the customary two percent had always been kept. It was a significant profit for each house. Now being asked to hand over one percent of it—everyone was reluctant.

Third Master Zhu said, "Don't look so sour. Once this is done, all the factory's stock will be ours, and the sugar price will have crashed to one *liang* five *qian*. Isn't the profit in that significant? Nitpicking over this bit of expense—no sense of the big picture!"

So it was decided. Each trading house advanced a sum to the Haiyi Hall public account, proportional to its size, for Third Master Zhu to draw on at any time. Since things were settled, everyone felt hungry and sat down to eat and drink.

Third Master Zhu barely touched his food before saying he had matters at home and left with his servant first. His residence was only four or five storefronts away. His house and business were connected as one—he could go to the trading house without even stepping outside. If he wanted to call on someone, he didn't need to go into the street—he could exit through a side gate and go directly into another trading house's residence, then continue through from one house to the next.

This was born of necessity. Though in recent years, through the Haiyi Hall's organization of local militias and cultivation of officials and various sea lords, attacks on Hai'an had become rare, small-scale robberies and kidnappings still occurred frequently. So the trading house residences were all wall-to-wall, connected by side gates, with barred lanes and high walls, forming a closed community. Ordinary pirates or bandits simply couldn't get in.

Third Master Zhu passed through several trading houses' back alleys to return to his own residence. After freshening up briefly, he summoned his house steward.

"Go fetch Zhao Jijiao for me." Then he closed his eyes to rest for a moment. The task of investigating South China Factory's background—he'd already sent a capable clerk to do that back when the Qiwei Escort Agency had been buying up land and sugar mills in the area. At the time, he'd just thought it worth asking why an escort agency was buying these properties. Who knew this casual move would turn out to be the right call! He was quite pleased with himself. If he were sending someone now—Guangzhou was over a thousand *li* away; a boat trip there and back would take over ten days! By then, the cauliflower would be cold.

Before going to the guild hall, he had actually already known the basic background of South China Factory. Just as he'd expected, there was another master behind the Qiwei Escort Agency. As for who this master was, the clerk hadn't managed to find out—the escort guards kept their mouths very tight, and ordinary clerks didn't know. But the matter of Lü Yizhong's calling card had been discovered through various channels: Lü Yizhong's cards were sold openly at a fixed price. As long as you could find the right connection, one or two hundred *liang* would get you one.

That being the case, this master was probably not an official figure. Judging by the fact that he had to buy Lü Yizhong's card as a protective talisman, he probably didn't have much background in government circles either—though he certainly had money.

With this basic information, Third Master Zhu knew what his next move should be. His performance earlier had just been a show for his colleagues, to get them to follow his plan.

"*At first glance startling beauty, at first glance startling beauty, I suddenly behold a little maid like a celestial fairy, her moth brows lightly swept, her natural charm rarely seen in this world. See her autumn-wave eyes gently send, exceptionally bright. I wish to plant flowers, best seize them while fresh...*"

Just as he was humming this little tune, the steward announced that Zhao Jijiao had arrived.

"Send him in."

A man in his thirties entered. He was dressed neatly enough, looking like a shop manager, but as he stood there, his body and head kept moving, eyes darting. Clearly not an upright character. Zhao Jijiao was a local gang leader, running a band of riffraff who hung around Hai'an Street at the Zou Monk Temple. Haiyi Hall sent them a monthly allowance of money and rice—partly to keep them from causing trouble, and partly so they'd be available for dirty work when needed.

"Little Zhao, tomorrow send all your boys out on the streets." Third Master Zhu spoke slowly. "Have them spread the word like this—" He then recited the prepared script.

"Got it all?"

"Your servant remembers everything!" Zhao Jijiao nodded.

"Here's fifty *liang* of silver. Give it out to them first!"

"Thank you, Master."

"Also, pick a few of the more presentable ones from your people and keep them ready. In the next few days, South China Sugar Factory will probably be hiring workers. Have them stand by to get hired. Tell them to work hard when the time comes—they only need to bear with it for a couple of months. When it's over, I'll reward them handsomely."

"Getting hired—won't that require a shop guarantee?" Zhao Jijiao looked troubled.

"No problem! I'll handle the guarantee. You just get the people ready and get them cleaned up!"

"Yes, but we'll still need some money for clothes and grooming..." Zhao Jijiao's eyes rolled as he tried to squeeze out more cash.

Third Master Zhu snorted. "I haven't paid out your reward money yet—take it out of this first!"

Hearing that there would be reward money, Zhao Jijiao's spirits rose. "This matter is all on me and my brothers." With that, he left in high spirits.

Watching Zhao Jijiao go, Third Master Zhu still felt uneasy. He decided: he would send someone to Guangzhou again to dig further into their background.

"If they really have no backing, just eliminate them! That sugar factory really is quite nice." Third Master Zhu's face revealed a glint of greed.

Meanwhile, at the South China Sugar Factory, the transmigrators were busily preparing for the trading house's opening. For easier management, the trading house site was chosen right at Nanmen Pond where the South China Sugar Factory was located—essentially just a sub-division of the factory. The front gate opened right onto the official road from Xuwen to Hai'an Street. Besides building the new trading house's shop front, Mei Lin also organized laborers to repair this stretch of road, re-erecting several wobbly bridges—improving infrastructure was always a precondition for the transmigrators' commercial and industrial ventures. As for the local people, they were merely curious about this new road-building method of having oxen drag large stone rollers back and forth.

The trading house's signboard had been inscribed by the county magistrate of Xuwen himself. His calligraphy came cheap—only thirty *liang* of silver, a few bottles of good wine, plus some Western cloth and brocade for his wife. As soon as the shop front was finished, with drums and gongs, the gilded signboard was hung up. The couplets on the pillars flanking the door had been written by a well-known retired official in the county. These were all like protective talismans. The transmigrators were adapting to local customs.

To facilitate communication with the locals and avoid language misunderstandings, Wen Tong recruited several local workers in the county to serve as front-counter staff and scale operators. His attempt to hire a sugar trading house manager had never come together. The Wen brothers were too young. In the end, he had to ask Liao Dahua to find someone—anyone who'd been a manager would do. Liao Dahua, not shy about recommending his own family, brought in a cousin of his named Liao Daxing. This Liao Daxing had never been a manager, but he'd worked for several years as a senior counter clerk at a grain trading house in Haikang County. He was quite adept at dealing with people, and though his Mandarin was poor, his Cantonese was quite good. He knew the rules of commerce. Wen Tong knew the trading house couldn't rely on these people—they were all amateurs. Only by taking charge himself would it work. Fortunately, the sugar factory was now running normally, and Chen Tianxiong was handling the equipment. He could devote more energy to the trading house business.

Liao Daxing, having just been promoted, and having heard from his cousin that these masters were wealthy and generous, worked very hard. Though the grain trading business was different from sugar trading, there was much in common—purchasing, transporting, and such. He took charge of all the trading house affairs one by one. Wen Tong actually found it more convenient to work with him—after all, Wen Tong was an engineer by training and not very business-minded.

After some market research, Wen Tong and Liao Daxing agreed to purchase at the current Hai'an Street rate of two *liang* five *qian*, without raising the price, to avoid provoking the local trading houses.

"Let's abolish this two percent rule." Wen Tong deeply resented such "hidden rules."

"Better not, for now," Chen Tianxiong advised. "Best not to stand out too much. Not good."

"I have an idea—we can keep the two percent rule," Chang Shide suddenly said. "But take it from the people and use it for the people. Lay the groundwork for Old Wen's future sugar cooperative."

"What's the idea?"

Chang Shide's proposal was to use this two percent as a kind of "common fund." This fund would be used to issue loans and subsidies to people who joined the sugar cooperative in the future.

"...Everyone who sells us sugar pays the two percent, but they can't get loans or subsidies unless they join us. Nobody likes to feel cheated. By then, when you promote the sugar cooperative, it'll be much easier."

"Should we explain this at the counter to the common folk? Or hold a mass meeting to announce it?"
