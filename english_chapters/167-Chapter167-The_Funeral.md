# Chapter 167: The Funeral

After 4-weeks' basic-training, Army Training-Battalion was officially-established. Though a "battalion"—being demonstration-unit, it was highly-integrated: infantry, skirmishers, artillery, and logistics.

Military-Committee's organization modeled 18th–early-19th-century European-armies. Battalion as basic-combat-unit. Each infantry-battalion: 6 companies. Each platoon: 3 squads. Each squad: 9 men. Platoon: 30 men. 3 platoons formed 1 company: 100 men. Companies had standard-bearer, drummer, fifer, plus 5-man cooking-squad.

Current Training-Battalion had only 3 infantry-companies, 1 skirmisher-platoon, plus 1 "grenadier-platoon"—here restored to original-meaning rather than "elite-infantry."

Chemistry-Department's No.1 grenade had weak-lethality. So they developed larger No.4 grenade—cast-iron shell. Materials insufficient, no suitable-explosives—so increased-size with more black-powder. Result: No.4's dimensions rivalled old-style mines.

Because heavy, thrown chain-ball-style—direct throwing only reached dozen-meters. No.4 lacked friction-fuse—using safer slow-match ignition. Throwers needed burning-cord—exactly like original-grenadiers.

This awkward-design made officers love-and-hate it. Still—any-poultice-that-draws-pus-is-good. Strong-armed far-throwers were selected as grenadiers. Standard-load: 4 grenades per-man in specialized-backboxes.

But training-accident occurred. Thrown-grenade exploded mid-air—shrapnel killed one-soldier, wounded several. Investigation: fuse-quality-failure. Burn-rate too-fast.

Fuse-manufacturing was technically-simple—paper and powder. But hand-made required skill. Nobody had pyrotechnics-factory experience. Book-learning produced uneven-density fuses—inconsistent burn-rates. Previously this just meant timing-errors—so fuses were cut long. But grenades couldn't have excessive-delay—or enemies could extinguish them. Result: tragedy.

This problem was significant-but-not-insurmountable. Chemistry-Group tested for days trying improved-processes. Unexpectedly—easy-solution appeared. One-day a peddler reached East Gate Market selling never-before-sold items: firecrackers. Recognizing their-value, Dongmen Chuiyu bought everything. Test-results were satisfactory. Next-day—this firecracker-craftsman was bayonet-escorted with family and tools to Bairren Commune.

Lingao's winter arrived imperceptibly. Despite "Little Ice Age," subtropical-Lingao's daytime temperatures remained above 20°C—cooler than D-Day. Now dry-season—rarely raining, always-sunny.

This day—barren-land 10+km outside Bairren Fortress suddenly-bustled. Villagers from all-directions, gentry, town-merchants, idlers... anyone without pressing-business headed toward this normally-deserted place. Today was "bald-people's" grand-funeral.

Lingao was backwater-town. Year-round entertainment—besides county-seat executions—was nil. Gentry funerals/weddings were common-entertainment. These mysterious-overseas-visitors warranted attention.

Deputy-Magistrate Wu Ya changed into plain-clothes, mingling with crowds. Unlike the magistrate, he was intensely-curious about these visitors.

Following crowds for about an-hour, he reached elevated-plateau west of Wenlan River. High-ground—irrigation was difficult—so always wasteland. Flat-surroundings with slightly-raised central-knoll. Soldiers stood-guard around knoll. Hillside and surrounding-grounds gathered many-people—local observers recognized "bald-people's" prominent-figures. All wearing neat-uniforms.

Besides them—many common-laborers working for "bald-people." Freshly-organized Army Training-Battalion Reference-Company wore starched crisp-uniforms. Oiled Minié-rifles gleamed. Bayonets glinted coldly.

At hill-base entrance: large rectangular black-stone-wall with small-arch. Path led through to central-knoll.

This 10-meter elevation knoll—topped by black-granite semi-circular wall. Carved-lotus pedestals decorated simply.

Stone-wall's top—carved in Han-clerical-script: "Cuigang Martyrs' Cemetery."

Wen Desi descended from automobile, slowly walking toward central-hill. As highest-authority representative, he'd preside over first transmigrator-funeral. Deceased: ordinary-soldier killed days-ago in grenade-training accident.

Li Shisan—in his unknown-brief lifetime—showed nothing suggesting historical-significance. Yet Cuigang Cemetery's honor-wall began with his-name.

No mourning-music. No gongs-and-drums. No monks droning sutras. No women wailing. Sky resounded with plaintive-bugle. As notes-rose, noisy-crowd suddenly-silenced. Reference-Company soldiers marched 75-steps/minute in formal-parade, rifles-at-shoulder. Bugle-ended. Two drummers led—slow-drumbeats. Two black-horses—unseen locally—drew four-wheeled gun-carriage bearing plain-wood coffin. Hoofbeats on flagstones matched slow-drums. Everything unprecedented—conveying respect, admiration, emotion. Atmosphere nearly-suffocating.

Coffin was rope-lowered into grave.

"Present arms! Fire!"

Seven Skirmisher-Platoon soldiers simultaneously rifle-saluted skyward—three volleys. Crisp-shots echoed over hills. Utter-silence. Into silence—*Taps* slowly-played. 24 notes slowly-rendered. Even transmigrators who'd come for propaganda-purposes were moved to tears—atmosphere was indeed-infectious.

Coffin-burial began.

"At death's moment, his soul ascended directly to heaven." Wen Desi solemnly-spoke. "Valkyries came for him. We bid farewell to his body. His soul watches from above..."

"That dead-one must be bald-people's top-official." Distant-spectators gossipered.

"Heard he wasn't—just a deputy."

"A deputy? Like this? Their emperor—probably needs 100 horses pulling that carriage."

"That soldier was locally-recruited—a *Fulao*. Enlisted just over a month. Killed during cannon-practice."

"Such splendor in death—life wasn't wasted." Someone actually-envied.

"Indeed. Our village Li-Elder's funeral procession stretched half-a-street—but all beggars lining-the-route. Where's this grandeur?"

Wu Ya overheard—pushed forward asking: "Really just a soldier who died?"

The speaker—seeing questioner's refined-bearing—answered carefully: "Obviously. My kinsman works for short-hairs—told me himself. False?"

"Can't understand their thinking. Just one soldier?"

"Buying-hearts." A ragged-but-arrogant scholar nearby sneered. "This counts as funeral? Zero propriety! Barbarians remain barbarians!"

"Quit nonsense. Where's the *Zhou-Li* mandating Wang-Bi's exorcist-chariot leading funeral-processions?" Someone sarcastically-countered.

Wu Ya didn't continue listening. Fear-or-admiration filled his-heart. Bald-bandits were buying-hearts—but their methods seemed more-effective, striking hearts' deepest-points. Wu Ya prided himself as bureaucratic-veteran—crying theatrically at Wanli-Emperor's mourning while calculating expense-allowances. But just now he'd been inexplicably-moved to tears—absurd in retrospect! What reason had he to cry? Bald-bandits' heart-manipulation reached demonic-levels! Since autumn-harvest, commoners seemed enchanted—streaming toward Bairren Beach. Defectors multiplying. Wu Ya was experienced—knew commoners didn't love officialdom. But except during-famines, they wouldn't defect to bandits. Lingao's harvest was decent this year—yet so-many left! What future awaited? This Great-Ming realm...!

Returning to camp, Executive-Committee noticed: New Army's strides lengthened, bearing sharper, spirits high. Soldiers spontaneously-sang newly-learned military-song:

*Beautiful fairy beckons from afar*

*Brave men—go fight valiantly*

*Hot-wind gusts toward us*

*Stirring our spirits*

*On your face—cold smile*

*Staring indifferently at earth*

*You face death calmly*

*I see everything*

*I know—you fear nothing*

*I know—you're utterly resolute*

*Someday—you'll discover*

*Your strength is boundless*

*Someday—you'll discover*

*You can create miracles*

*Beautiful fairy beckons from afar*

*For tomorrow—warriors go fight*

*Like Death soaring blue-skies*

*Embrace battle—release all passion*

*For tomorrow—hesitate no more*

*Brave men—go fight valiantly*

This song—set to EVA's tune—sung by hundreds of voicebox-mismatched brawny-men produced remarkable "laughter-effect." Officers wore strange-smiles. Some suppressed-laughter until faces-distorted.

Wei Aiwen smugly told Ma Qianzhu: "Chief-of-Staff Ma—this funeral was brilliant? Look at morale!"

"You just copied Arlington-Cemetery's rituals, added foreign-flavoring. I expected Scottish-bagpipes."

"We bought bagpipes—nobody can play! Little-Xiong only does one *Grenadier's March* on flute. Otherwise—even-better-effect!"

"Stop self-praising. Without Xiao Zishan's Cuigang-Cemetery proposal a-month-ago—would this work?"

"He contributed too—I don't deny—"

"Acknowledging others' contributions is good." Ma Qianzhu vaguely-sensed Wei Aiwen's recent-issues. But one thing was certain: he was beginning to self-inflate.
