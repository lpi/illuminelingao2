# Chapter 167: The Funeral

After four weeks of basic training, the Army Training Battalion was officially established. Though called a "battalion"—being a demonstration unit, it was highly integrated, with infantry, skirmishers, artillery, and logistics.

The Military Committee's organization was modeled on 18th to early 19th-century European armies. The battalion was the basic combat unit. Each infantry battalion had six companies. Each platoon had three squads. Each squad had nine men. A platoon had thirty men. Three platoons formed one company of 100 men. Companies had a standard-bearer, a drummer, a fifer, plus a five-man cooking squad.

The current Training Battalion had only three infantry companies, one skirmisher platoon, plus one "grenadier platoon"—here restored to its original meaning rather than "elite infantry."

The Chemistry Department's No. 1 grenade had weak lethality, so they developed the larger No. 4 grenade with a cast-iron shell. Due to insufficient materials and no suitable explosives, they increased the size with more black powder. The result was that the No. 4's dimensions rivaled old-style mines.

Because it was heavy and thrown "chain-ball" style, a direct throw only reached a dozen meters. The No. 4 lacked a friction fuse, using a safer slow-match ignition instead. Throwers needed a burning cord—exactly like the original grenadiers.

This awkward design made officers love and hate it. Still—any poultice that draws pus is good. Strong-armed far-throwers were selected as grenadiers. Their standard load was four grenades per man in specialized backboxes.

But a training accident occurred. A thrown grenade exploded mid-air—shrapnel killed one soldier and wounded several. The investigation revealed a fuse quality failure: the burn rate was too fast.

Fuse manufacturing was technically simple—paper and powder. But making them by hand required skill, and nobody had experience in a pyrotechnics factory. Book learning produced fuses of uneven density, leading to inconsistent burn rates. Previously this just meant timing errors, so fuses were cut long. But grenades couldn't have excessive delay, or enemies could extinguish them. The result was tragedy.

This problem was significant but not insurmountable. The Chemistry Group tested for days trying improved processes. Unexpectedly, an easy solution appeared. One day, a peddler reached the East Gate Market selling items never before sold there: firecrackers. Recognizing their value, Dongmen Chuiyu bought everything. The test results were satisfactory. The next day, this firecracker craftsman was escorted at bayonet-point, along with his family and tools, to the Bairren Commune.

Lingao's winter arrived imperceptibly. Despite the "Little Ice Age," subtropical Lingao's daytime temperatures remained above 20°C—cooler than D-Day. Now it was the dry season—rarely raining, always sunny.

On this day, the barren land more than ten kilometers outside Bairren Fortress suddenly bustled. Villagers from all directions, gentry, town merchants, idlers... anyone without pressing business headed toward this normally deserted place. Today was the "bald people's" grand funeral.

Lingao was a backwater town. Year-round entertainment—besides executions at the county seat—was nil. Gentry funerals and weddings were common entertainment. These mysterious overseas visitors warranted attention.

Deputy Magistrate Wu Ya changed into plain clothes, mingling with the crowds. Unlike the magistrate, he was intensely curious about these visitors.

Following the crowds for about an hour, he reached an elevated plateau west of the Wenlan River. Being high ground, irrigation was difficult, so it was always wasteland. The surroundings were flat with a slightly raised central knoll. Soldiers stood guard around the knoll. The hillside and surrounding grounds gathered many people—local observers recognized the "bald people's" prominent figures. All were wearing neat uniforms.

Besides them, there were many common laborers working for the "bald people." The freshly organized Army Training Battalion Reference Company wore starched, crisp uniforms. Oiled Minié rifles gleamed. Bayonets glinted coldly.

At the hill base entrance, there was a large rectangular black stone wall with a small arch. A path led through to the central knoll.

This 10-meter elevation knoll was topped by a black granite semi-circular wall. Carved lotus pedestals decorated it simply.

Carved in Han clerical script on the top of the stone wall were the words: "Cuigang Martyrs' Cemetery."

Wen Desi descended from the automobile, slowly walking toward the central hill. As the representative of the highest authority, he would preside over the first transmigrator funeral. The deceased was an ordinary soldier killed days ago in the grenade training accident.

Li Shisan, in his brief and unknown lifetime, showed nothing suggesting historical significance. Yet the Cuigang Cemetery's honor wall began with his name.

There was no mourning music, no gongs and drums, no monks droning sutras, and no women wailing. The sky resounded with a plaintive bugle. As the notes rose, the noisy crowd suddenly fell silent. The Reference Company soldiers marched at 75 steps per minute in formal parade, rifles at their shoulders. The bugle ended. Two drummers led with slow drumbeats. Two black horses—a breed unseen locally—drew a four-wheeled gun carriage bearing a plain wooden coffin. The hoofbeats on the flagstones matched the slow drums. Everything was unprecedented—conveying respect, admiration, and emotion. The atmosphere was nearly suffocating.

The coffin was rope-lowered into the grave.

"Present arms! Fire!"

Seven Skirmisher Platoon soldiers simultaneously rifle-saluted skyward with three volleys. The crisp shots echoed over the hills. Utter silence. Into the silence, *Taps* slowly played. Twenty-four notes were slowly rendered. Even the transmigrators who had come for propaganda purposes were moved to tears—the atmosphere was indeed infectious.

The coffin burial began.

"At the moment of death, his soul ascended directly to heaven," Wen Desi solemnly spoke. "Valkyries came for him. We bid farewell to his body. His soul watches from above..."

"That dead one must be the bald people's top official," distant spectators gossiped.

"I heard he wasn't—he was just a deputy."

"A deputy? Like this? Their emperor probably needs 100 horses pulling that carriage."

"That soldier was locally recruited—a *Fulao*. Enlisted just over a month. Kill during cannon practice."

"Such splendor in death—life wasn't wasted," someone actually envied.

"Indeed. Our village Li Elder's funeral procession stretched half a street—but it was all beggars lining the route. Where's this grandeur?"

Wu Ya overheard this and pushed forward, asking, "Was it really just one soldier who died?"

The speaker, seeing the questioner's refined bearing, answered carefully, "Obviously. My kinsman works for the short-hairs—told me himself. Would I tell you false?"

"Can't understand their thinking. Just one soldier?"

"Buying hearts," a ragged but arrogant scholar nearby sneered. "This counts as a funeral? There is zero propriety! Barbarians remain barbarians!"

"Quit your nonsense. Where does the *Zhou-Li* mandate Wang Bi's exorcist chariot leading funeral processions?" someone sarcastically countered.

Wu Ya didn't continue listening. Fear or admiration filled his heart. The bald bandits were buying hearts—but their methods seemed more effective, striking at the deepest points of the heart. Wu Ya prided himself on being a bureaucratic veteran—he could cry theatrically at the Wanli Emperor's mourning while calculating his expense allowances. But just now he had been inexplicably moved to tears—absurd in retrospect! What reason had he to cry? The bald bandits' heart manipulation reached demonic levels! Since the autumn harvest, commoners seemed enchanted, streaming toward Bairren Beach. Defectors were multiplying. Wu Ya was experienced—he knew commoners didn't love officialdom. But except during famines, they wouldn't defect to bandits. Lingao's harvest was decent this year—yet so many left! What future awaited? This Great Ming realm...!

Returning to camp, the Executive Committee noticed the New Army's strides had lengthened, their bearing was sharper, and their spirits were high. Soldiers spontaneously sang a newly learned military song:

*Beautiful fairy beckons from afar*

*Brave men—go fight valiantly*

*Hot wind gusts toward us*

*Stirring our spirits*

*On your face—cold smile*

*Staring indifferently at earth*

*You face death calmly*

*I see everything*

*I know—you fear nothing*

*I know—you're utterly resolute*

*Someday—you'll discover*

*Your strength is boundless*

*Someday—you'll discover*

*You can create miracles*

*Beautiful fairy beckons from afar*

*For tomorrow—warriors go fight*

*Like Death soaring blue skies*

*Embrace battle—release all passion*

*For tomorrow—hesitate no more*

*Brave men—go fight valiantly*

This song—set to EVA's tune and sung by hundreds of brawny men with mismatched voices—produced a remarkable "laughter effect." The officers wore strange smiles. Some suppressed laughter until their faces distorted.

Wei Aiwen smugly told Ma Qianzhu, "Chief of Staff Ma—this funeral was brilliant? Look at morale!"

"You just copied Arlington Cemetery's rituals, added foreign flavoring. I expected Scottish bagpipes."

"We bought bagpipes—nobody can play! Little Xiong only knows *The British Grenadiers* on the flute. Otherwise—even better effect!"

"Stop self-praising. Without Xiao Zishan's Cuigang Cemetery proposal a month ago, would this have worked?"

"He contributed too—I don't deny—"

"It's good to acknowledge others' contributions." Ma Qianzhu vaguely sensed Wei Aiwen's recent issues. But one thing was certain: he was beginning to self-inflate.
