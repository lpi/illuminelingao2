# Chapter 167: The Funeral

After 4 weeks' basic training, Army Training Battalion was officially established. Though a "battalion"—being a demonstration unit, it was highly integrated: infantry, skirmishers, artillery, and logistics.

The Military Committee's organization modeled 18th–early 19th-century European armies. Battalion was the basic combat unit. Each infantry battalion: 6 companies. Each platoon: 3 squads. Each squad: 9 men. Platoon: 30 men. 3 platoons formed 1 company: 100 men. Companies had a standard-bearer, drummer, fifer, plus a 5-man cooking squad.

The current Training Battalion had only 3 infantry companies, 1 skirmisher platoon, plus 1 "grenadier platoon"—here restored to its original meaning rather than "elite infantry."

Chemistry Department's No.1 grenade had weak lethality. So they developed the larger No.4 grenade—cast-iron shell. Materials insufficient, no suitable explosives—so increased size with more black powder. Result: No.4's dimensions rivaled old-style mines.

Because heavy, thrown chain-ball style—direct throwing only reached a dozen meters. No.4 lacked friction fuse—using safer slow-match ignition. Throwers needed burning cord—exactly like original grenadiers.

This awkward design made officers love and hate it. Still—any poultice that draws pus is good. Strong-armed far-throwers were selected as grenadiers. Standard load: 4 grenades per man in specialized backboxes.

But a training accident occurred. A thrown grenade exploded mid-air—shrapnel killed one soldier, wounded several. Investigation: fuse quality failure. Burn rate too fast.

Fuse manufacturing was technically simple—paper and powder. But hand-made required skill. Nobody had pyrotechnics factory experience. Book learning produced uneven density fuses—inconsistent burn rates. Previously this just meant timing errors—so fuses were cut long. But grenades couldn't have excessive delay—or enemies could extinguish them. Result: tragedy.

This problem was significant but not insurmountable. Chemistry Group tested for days trying improved processes. Unexpectedly—an easy solution appeared. One day a peddler reached East Gate Market selling never-before-sold items: firecrackers. Recognizing their value, Dongmen Chuiyu bought everything. Test results were satisfactory. Next day—this firecracker craftsman was bayonet-escorted with family and tools to Bairren Commune.

Lingao's winter arrived imperceptibly. Despite "Little Ice Age," subtropical Lingao's daytime temperatures remained above 20°C—cooler than D-Day. Now dry season—rarely raining, always sunny.

This day—barren land 10+ km outside Bairren Fortress suddenly bustled. Villagers from all directions, gentry, town merchants, idlers... anyone without pressing business headed toward this normally deserted place. Today was "bald people's" grand funeral.

Lingao was a backwater town. Year-round entertainment—besides county seat executions—was nil. Gentry funerals and weddings were common entertainment. These mysterious overseas visitors warranted attention.

Deputy Magistrate Wu Ya changed into plain clothes, mingling with the crowds. Unlike the magistrate, he was intensely curious about these visitors.

Following crowds for about an hour, he reached an elevated plateau west of Wenlan River. High ground—irrigation was difficult—so always wasteland. Flat surroundings with a slightly raised central knoll. Soldiers stood guard around the knoll. Hillside and surrounding grounds gathered many people—local observers recognized "bald people's" prominent figures. All wearing neat uniforms.

Besides them—many common laborers working for "bald people." The freshly organized Army Training Battalion Reference Company wore starched crisp uniforms. Oiled Minié rifles gleamed. Bayonets glinted coldly.

At the hill base entrance: a large rectangular black stone wall with a small arch. A path led through to the central knoll.

This 10-meter elevation knoll was topped by a black granite semi-circular wall. Carved lotus pedestals decorated it simply.

The stone wall's top—carved in Han clerical script: "Cuigang Martyrs' Cemetery."

Wen Desi descended from the automobile, slowly walking toward the central hill. As the highest authority representative, he'd preside over the first transmigrator funeral. Deceased: an ordinary soldier killed days ago in the grenade training accident.

Li Shisan—in his unknown brief lifetime—showed nothing suggesting historical significance. Yet Cuigang Cemetery's honor wall began with his name.

No mourning music. No gongs and drums. No monks droning sutras. No women wailing. The sky resounded with a plaintive bugle. As notes rose, the noisy crowd suddenly silenced. Reference Company soldiers marched 75 steps/minute in formal parade, rifles at shoulder. The bugle ended. Two drummers led—slow drumbeats. Two black horses—unseen locally—drew a four-wheeled gun carriage bearing a plain wood coffin. Hoofbeats on flagstones matched the slow drums. Everything was unprecedented—conveying respect, admiration, emotion. The atmosphere was nearly suffocating.

The coffin was rope-lowered into the grave.

"Present arms! Fire!"

Seven Skirmisher Platoon soldiers simultaneously rifle-saluted skyward—three volleys. Crisp shots echoed over the hills. Utter silence. Into silence—*Taps* slowly played. 24 notes slowly rendered. Even transmigrators who'd come for propaganda purposes were moved to tears—the atmosphere was indeed infectious.

Coffin burial began.

"At death's moment, his soul ascended directly to heaven." Wen Desi solemnly spoke. "Valkyries came for him. We bid farewell to his body. His soul watches from above..."

"That dead one must be bald people's top official." Distant spectators gossiped.

"Heard he wasn't—just a deputy."

"A deputy? Like this? Their emperor—probably needs 100 horses pulling that carriage."

"That soldier was locally recruited—a *Fulao*. Enlisted just over a month. Killed during cannon practice."

"Such splendor in death—life wasn't wasted." Someone actually envied.

"Indeed. Our village Li Elder's funeral procession stretched half a street—but all beggars lining the route. Where's this grandeur?"

Wu Ya overheard—pushed forward asking: "Really just a soldier who died?"

The speaker—seeing the questioner's refined bearing—answered carefully: "Obviously. My kinsman works for short-hairs—told me himself. False?"

"Can't understand their thinking. Just one soldier?"

"Buying hearts." A ragged but arrogant scholar nearby sneered. "This counts as funeral? Zero propriety! Barbarians remain barbarians!"

"Quit nonsense. Where's the *Zhou-Li* mandating Wang Bi's exorcist chariot leading funeral processions?" Someone sarcastically countered.

Wu Ya didn't continue listening. Fear or admiration filled his heart. The bald bandits were buying hearts—but their methods seemed more effective, striking hearts' deepest points. Wu Ya prided himself as a bureaucratic veteran—crying theatrically at Wanli Emperor's mourning while calculating expense allowances. But just now he'd been inexplicably moved to tears—absurd in retrospect! What reason had he to cry? The bald bandits' heart manipulation reached demonic levels! Since autumn harvest, commoners seemed enchanted—streaming toward Bairren Beach. Defectors were multiplying. Wu Ya was experienced—he knew commoners didn't love officialdom. But except during famines, they wouldn't defect to bandits. Lingao's harvest was decent this year—yet so many left! What future awaited? This Great Ming realm...!

Returning to camp, the Executive Committee noticed: New Army's strides lengthened, bearing sharper, spirits high. Soldiers spontaneously sang a newly learned military song:

*Beautiful fairy beckons from afar*

*Brave men—go fight valiantly*

*Hot wind gusts toward us*

*Stirring our spirits*

*On your face—cold smile*

*Staring indifferently at earth*

*You face death calmly*

*I see everything*

*I know—you fear nothing*

*I know—you're utterly resolute*

*Someday—you'll discover*

*Your strength is boundless*

*Someday—you'll discover*

*You can create miracles*

*Beautiful fairy beckons from afar*

*For tomorrow—warriors go fight*

*Like Death soaring blue skies*

*Embrace battle—release all passion*

*For tomorrow—hesitate no more*

*Brave men—go fight valiantly*

This song—set to EVA's tune—sung by hundreds of voicebox-mismatched brawny men produced a remarkable "laughter effect." Officers wore strange smiles. Some suppressed laughter until their faces distorted.

Wei Aiwen smugly told Ma Qianzhu: "Chief of Staff Ma—this funeral was brilliant? Look at morale!"

"You just copied Arlington Cemetery's rituals, added foreign flavoring. I expected Scottish bagpipes."

"We bought bagpipes—nobody can play! Little Xiong only does one *Grenadier's March* on flute. Otherwise—even better effect!"

"Stop self-praising. Without Xiao Zishan's Cuigang Cemetery proposal a month ago—would this work?"

"He contributed too—I don't deny—"

"Acknowledging others' contributions is good." Ma Qianzhu vaguely sensed Wei Aiwen's recent issues. But one thing was certain: he was beginning to self-inflate.
