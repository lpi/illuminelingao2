# Chapter 167: The Funeral

After four weeks of basic training, the Army Training Battalion was officially established. Though called a "battalion," as a demonstration unit, it was highly integrated, comprising infantry, skirmishers, artillery, and logistics elements.

The Military Committee's organization was modeled on the European armies of the late 18th to early 19th centuries. The battalion was the basic combat unit. Each infantry battalion consisted of six companies. Each platoon had three squads, and each squad had nine men. A platoon consisted of thirty men. Three platoons formed one company of one hundred men. Companies also had a standard-bearer, a drummer, a fifer, plus a five-man cooking squad.

The current Training Battalion had only three infantry companies, one skirmisher platoon, plus one "grenadier platoon"—here restored to its original historical meaning rather than "elite infantry."

The Chemistry Department's No. 1 grenade lacked lethality, so they developed the larger No. 4 grenade with a cast-iron shell. Due to insufficient materials and a lack of suitable explosives, they compensated by increasing the size and filling it with more black powder. The result was that the No. 4's dimensions rivaled those of old-style defensive mines.

Because it was heavy and thrown using a "hammer-throw" style, a direct throw only reached a dozen meters. The No. 4 lacked a friction fuse, using a safer slow-match ignition instead. Throwers needed a burning cord—exactly like the original grenadiers of history.

Officers had a love-hate relationship with this awkward design. Still, it was better than nothing. Soldiers with strong arms who could throw far were selected as grenadiers. Their standard load was four grenades per man, carried in specialized backboxes.

However, a training accident occurred. A thrown grenade exploded mid-air—shrapnel killed one soldier and wounded several others. The investigation revealed a fuse quality failure: the burn rate was too fast.

Fuse manufacturing was technically simple—just paper and powder. But making them by hand required skill, and nobody had experience in a pyrotechnics factory. Relying on book learning produced fuses of uneven density, leading to inconsistent burn rates. Previously, this just meant timing errors, so fuses were cut long to compensate. But grenades couldn't have excessive delays, or enemies could pick them up or extinguish them. The result was tragedy.

This problem was significant but not insurmountable. The Chemistry Group tested for days trying to improve the process. Unexpectedly, an easy solution appeared. One day, a peddler reached the East Gate Market selling items never before sold there: firecrackers. Recognizing their value, Dongmen Chuiyu bought his entire stock. The test results were satisfactory. The next day, this firecracker craftsman was "escorted" at bayonet-point, along with his family and tools, to the Bairren Commune.

Lingao's winter arrived imperceptibly. Despite the "Little Ice Age," subtropical Lingao's daytime temperatures remained above 20°C—it was cooler than D-Day, but still warm. Now it was the dry season—rarely raining, always sunny.

On this day, the barren land more than ten kilometers outside Bairren Fortress suddenly bustled with activity. Villagers from all directions, gentry, town merchants, idlers... anyone without pressing business headed toward this normally deserted place. Today was the "bald people's" grand funeral.

Lingao was a backwater town where year-round entertainment—besides executions at the county seat—was virtually nonexistent. Gentry funerals and weddings were common forms of entertainment. These mysterious overseas visitors warranted special attention.

Deputy Magistrate Wu Ya changed into plain clothes, mingling with the crowds. Unlike the magistrate, he harbored an intense curiosity about these visitors.

Following the crowds for about an hour, he reached an elevated plateau west of the Wenlan River. Being high ground, irrigation was difficult, so it had always been wasteland. The surroundings were flat with a slightly raised central knoll. Soldiers stood guard around the knoll. The hillside and surrounding grounds gathered many people—local observers recognized the "bald people's" prominent figures. All were wearing neat uniforms.

Besides them, there were many common laborers working for the "bald people." The freshly organized Army Training Battalion Demonstration Company wore starched, crisp uniforms. Oiled Minié rifles gleamed, and bayonets glinted coldly in the sun.

At the entrance to the hill base, there was a large rectangular black stone wall with a small arch. A path led through it to the central knoll.

This ten-meter-high knoll was topped by a black granite semi-circular wall. Carved lotus pedestals decorated it simply.

Carved in Han clerical script on the top of the stone wall were the words: "Cuigang Martyrs' Cemetery."

Wen Desi descended from his vehicle, slowly walking toward the central hill. As the representative of the highest authority, he would preside over the first transmigrator funeral. The deceased was an ordinary soldier killed days ago in the grenade training accident.

Li Shisan, in his brief and unknown lifetime, showed nothing suggesting historical significance. Yet the honor wall of Cuigang Cemetery began with his name.

There was no mourning music, no gongs and drums, no monks droning sutras, and no women wailing. The sky resounded with a plaintive bugle call. As the notes rose, the noisy crowd suddenly fell silent. The Demonstration Company soldiers marched at 75 steps per minute in formal parade, rifles at their shoulders. The bugle ended. Two drummers led with slow, rhythmic beats. Two black horses—a breed unseen locally—drew a four-wheeled gun carriage bearing a plain wooden coffin. The hoofbeats on the flagstones matched the slow drums. Everything was unprecedented—conveying respect, admiration, and solemn emotion. The atmosphere was nearly suffocating.

The coffin was lowered into the grave with ropes.

"Present arms! Fire!"

Seven soldiers from the Skirmisher Platoon simultaneously fired a rifle salute skyward with three volleys. The crisp shots echoed over the hills. Utter silence followed. Into the silence, *Taps* was slowly played. Twenty-four notes were slowly rendered. Even the transmigrators who had come primarily for propaganda purposes were moved to tears—the atmosphere was indeed infectious.

The burial began.

"At the moment of death, his soul ascended directly to heaven," Wen Desi spoke solemnly. "The Valkyries have come for him. We bid farewell to his body. His soul watches from above..."

"That dead one must be the bald people's top official," distant spectators gossiped.

"I heard he wasn't—he was just a deputy."

"A deputy? Like this? Their emperor probably needs a hundred horses pulling that carriage."

"That soldier was locally recruited—a *Fulao* man. Enlisted just over a month ago. Killed during cannon practice."

"Such splendor in death—his life wasn't wasted," someone actually said enviously.

"Indeed. Our village Li Elder's funeral procession stretched half a street—but it was all beggars lining the route. Where is this kind of grandeur?"

Wu Ya overheard this conversation and pushed forward, asking, "Was it really just one soldier who died?"

The speaker, seeing the questioner's refined bearing, answered carefully, "Obviously. My kinsman works for the short-hairs—told me himself. Would I tell you false?"

"Can't understand their thinking. Just one soldier?"

"Winning hearts and minds," a ragged but arrogant scholar nearby sneered. "This counts as a funeral? There is zero propriety! Barbarians will be barbarians!"

"Quit your nonsense. Where does the *Rites of Zhou* mandate the exorcist chariot leading funeral processions?" someone sarcastically countered.

Wu Ya didn't continue listening. Fear or admiration filled his heart. The bald bandits were winning hearts—but their methods seemed more effective, striking at the deepest points of the human soul. Wu Ya prided himself on being a bureaucratic veteran—he could cry theatrically at the Wanli Emperor's mourning while calculating his expense allowances. But just now he had been inexplicably moved to tears—absurd in retrospect! What reason had he to cry? The bald bandits' manipulation of hearts reached demonic levels! Since the autumn harvest, commoners seemed enchanted, streaming toward Bairren Beach. Defectors were multiplying. Wu Ya was experienced—he knew commoners didn't love officialdom. But except during famines, they wouldn't defect to bandits. Lingao's harvest was decent this year—yet so many left! What future awaited this Great Ming realm...?

Returning to camp, the Executive Committee noticed the New Army's strides had lengthened, their bearing was sharper, and their spirits were high. Soldiers spontaneously sang a newly learned military song:

*Beautiful angel beckons from afar,*
*Brave warriors—go forth and fight valiantly!*
*The hot wind gusts toward us,*
*Stirring our spirits high.*
*On your face—a cold smile,*
*Staring indifferently at the earth.*
*You face death calmly,*
*I see everything clearly.*
*I know—you fear nothing,*
*I know—you're utterly resolute.*
*Someday—you'll discover,*
*Your strength is boundless.*
*Someday—you'll discover,*
*You can create miracles.*
*Beautiful angel beckons from afar,*
*For tomorrow—warriors go fight!*
*Like Death soaring in blue skies,*
*Embrace battle—release all passion!*
*For tomorrow—hesitate no more,*
*Brave warriors—go forth and fight valiantly!*

This song—set to the tune of *A Cruel Angel's Thesis* and sung by hundreds of brawny men with mismatched voices—produced a remarkable "cringe comedy" effect for the transmigrators. The officers wore strange smiles. Some suppressed laughter until their faces distorted.

Wei Aiwen smugly told Ma Qianzhu, "Chief of Staff Ma—this funeral was brilliant, wasn't it? Look at the morale!"

"You just copied Arlington Cemetery's rituals and added some foreign flavoring. I expected Scottish bagpipes next."

"We bought bagpipes—but nobody can play them! Little Xiong only knows *The British Grenadiers* on the flute. Otherwise—it would have been an even better effect!"

"Stop praising yourself. Without Xiao Zishan's Cuigang Cemetery proposal a month ago, would this have worked?"

"He contributed too—I don't deny—"

"It's good to acknowledge others' contributions." Ma Qianzhu vaguely sensed Wei Aiwen's recent issues. But one thing was certain: he was beginning to inflate with pride.
