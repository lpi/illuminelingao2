# Chapter 2297: Turning Hostile Ruthlessly

Which merchant was suitable? Chang Qingyun said rather than finding other people, better finding Shopkeeper Jiang buying rice cloth’s Ruijintang Silk Shop; in Wuzhou also was hundred year old shop; several generations inheritance; had foundation had credit; saving at their counter definitely no problem.

So this matter settled down; passed a few days, Ruijintang sent several clerks, quietly transported silver back again; leaving three pieces ox horn small seals.

"Making half day this silver just went here a circle, sent back again." Liu Youwang looking at these three seals somewhat reluctant to part, "Didn't boil hot."

Jiang Yougong however didn't have his so many sentimental feelings; he casually stuffed own and giving Zhu Si’s seals into bosom, said: "This silver carrying on body easy happening accident; saving in this big shop instead is safe..."

Liu Youwang watched him hiding seal into sleeve, as if meat on body was torn off a piece. Dry laughed a few sounds, full belly unwillingness.

He more thinking more felt not taste; self vainly gave him taking away almost half wealth—this Sanheui’s Camp Manager was him, not Jiang Yougong! Even wanting to share some benefits to him, this forty percent also too much. Besides taking away one hundred taels this time was even more no reason—who responsible for guarding camp wasn't same? Completely no relation with him; yet went to stuff Zhu Si this dog hole!

Zhu Si this brat look appearance also not kind stubble; knowing here had benefits, wouldn't from time to time want to come share one two?

More thinking he more felt Jiang Yougong "Not interesting (Generous/Fair)", heart not happy. But right now self wanting to "Make Fortune" in this camp couldn't lack him this "Strategist"...

Suddenly, Liu Youwang’s heart moved: speaking of strategist, Chang Qingyun wasn't exact ready made strategist?! Saying ability, he was much bigger than Jiang Yougong—dignified Juren Old Master, even served as Two Guangs Governor-General’s staff; matters on officialdom wouldn't understand more than Jiang Yougong this small Whistle Officer?

And this Old Master Chang, since matter of Qiaoniang taught a lesson, was much obedient than before. Doing things also capable. Key was, he was a captive; dead alive all in own hand; first didn't need share silver to him; second need not fear him speaking randomly outside; third, in case having what matter, killing him no future trouble.

Liu Youwang more calculating more felt own abacus wonderful. Just now Jiang Yougong and he collusion already very deep; hard to remove him safely...

Jiang Yougong where knew this Liu Youwang raised disaster heart. Taking seal eagerly came to see Zhu Si; after complimenting National Army Battalion Commander a few sentences, then quietly stuffed this ox horn small seal to him.

"One hundred *dan* white rice; not enough respect."

Zhu Si understood this slang; white rice was silver; one hundred *dan* was one hundred taels. He smiled slightly; heart said this Sanheui indeed had oil water! No wonder this Jiang Yougong refused to rotate defense; insist on relying in Sanheui.

Seemed future still could extort him a extort; but now, exactly was grain transfer key time; better stabilize him first then say. Immediately full face smile "Smile Accepted"; also said some comforting people heart words. Also said recently grain boat fleet would arrive; ask him do well guard work in Sanheui; to prevent change and so on.

Liu Youwang since raised this thought, heart always itchy. Thinking how could "Safely" handle Jiang Yougong away. Although his brain not flexible, could also understand, no matter which method to handle this "Brother," all had huge risk implicating himself; best was able to one labor forever ease calling him unable to open mouth...

So complex conspiracy, with his level naturally couldn't think out; thinking for half day, finally still called Chang Qingyun coming.

"Old Chang ah, my friend has a matter, want to ask you plot plot..." Liu Youwang opened mouth somewhat bashful hesitant.

"Old Master please order." Chang Qingyun for a moment didn't know so right (what it meant), asked.

"I have a friend ah, has a business, business not bad. But he busy ah—so hired a shopkeeper to help; but this shopkeeper, no ability, also doesn't do thing; every year wants to share half silver..." Liu Youwang actually not quite able to speak; rambling like this already somewhat messy language; sweat on forehead all came out, "...You say say, how to drive this shopkeeper away running—also can't call him have complaint?"

Chang Qingyun heard baffling. This was which act? Liu Youwang this person’s background he roughly knew; was abject poverty peasant family; captured by Hair thief being Fake Hair—person like this where came doing business friend? Besides thing this Liu Youwang said also not compatible constant reason...

His brain turned very fast; after doubt passing moment then understood: This "I have a friend" was "Myself." This Liu Youwang was talking about him and Jiang Yougong’s matter!

Chang Qingyun suddenly got interest; in his view, Jiang Yougong and Liu Youwang always "Wearing one pair trousers"; this moment thing Liu Youwang said showed contradiction existed between two.

He was what clever person; connecting front back slightly deducing then understood: Liu Youwang disliked Jiang Yougong taking too much interest in Sanheui; change word saying, he wanted "Eating Solitary Food."

This also counted human constant emotion; Chang Qingyun saw much in past. But at this juncture, Liu Youwang suddenly raised such thought; didn't know if could utilize a bit?

He coughed lightly one sound, said: "Wanting to drive person leaving, don't know is what driving method, want Civil Drive or Martial Drive?"

Liu Youwang seeing him chest having bamboo, knew he had idea; involuntarily greatly happy, smiled: "You reading book people just ways many! What called Civil Drive, what called Martial Drive?"

"Civil Drive, that naturally is doing person leaving a line, other day good to meet. Treating him wine; in banquet saying a few soft words; only say small shop temple small cannot contain you this big Bodhisattva; ask him seek other high job; then send a big sum money wealth; buying a harmony peace."

"This still has to pay another sum money; not good not good! Martial Drive?"

Chang Qingyun deliberately solemn face said: "Martial Drive easy; just want to see if Shop owner has power or not..."

"How?" Liu Youwang got interest.

"Speaking of Martial Drive, that is tearing face skin broken. But tearing face skin also has several kinds. One kind, is Shop owner wealth big power big; directly tell Shopkeeper roll bedding get out. Even if Shopkeeper heart unwilling, dare not offend either; can only obediently walk person."

"En, this sounds not bad; but this Shop owner afraid not this powerful."

"Another kind, is Shop owner since has no power. Shopkeeper cut off wealth road naturally harbor resentment in heart; inevitably will think method to revenge." Chang Qingyun intentionally wanted to hang his appetite, "Only thousand days being thief, no thousand days guarding against thief. In case bitten back by him one mouth, Shop owner also can't endure..."

Liu Youwang listened entering spirit; anxious said: "Then how?"

"Then have to see if Shop owner dares to lay Black Hand."

"Oh? How to lay Black Hand?" Liu Youwang asked anxiously.

"Method laying Black Hand thousand thousand ten thousand. Easiest is planting stolen goods framing." Chang Qingyun said, "Falsely accusing him embezzling stealing counter silver; catch firmly on spot; cannot help him; only can write confession roll bedding get out himself—but have one point, absolutely can't move official shock government office; otherwise entangling up, Shop owner also will lose wealth."

"En en, but this matter not safe ah. Shopkeeper didn't embezzle; naturally will think is Shop owner framing. Isn't it want to harbor resentment in heart."

Chang Qingyun heart secretly said, this Liu Youwang really was a cruel heart intestine! Then deliberately said:

"Having confession in hand, ordinary person dare not bomb hair. Also counts long peace long safety. But this knot certainly is tied; in case having a day falling in his hand, then hard to say..."

"If want no future trouble?"

"Wanting one labor forever ease, then not only want to lay Black Hand, have to lay Heavy Hand." Chang Qingyun said, "This needs Shop owner have this ruthless energy or not."

Liu Youwang didn't chase asking how to lay Heavy Hand; thought thought asked: "Shop owner I know, he even killing person ruthless energy has."

"Just daring kill person not enough. If discovered by government office, is person wealth two empty."

Liu Youwang silent for half moment, didn't chase ask down again. Long time, he then said: "Advisor Chang, you handle things reliable; also come from Advisor background; many things in camp later still want ask you help more."

Chang Qingyun seeing a wipe of cold light in his eye pupil, knew this person already moved killing heart; couldn't help heart bottom trembled; hurriedly bowed body said: "Many thanks Old Master look after; Student definitely exert force."

"This Liu Youwang is wanting to lay Black Hand on Jiang Yougong ah." Yi Haoran muttered, "This adds quite a few variables."

"Yes, so I rushed to see you; don't know if this matter has influence..." Chang Qingyun said.

Laying Black Hand successful, whether Jiang Yougong leaving office or rotating defense, Sanheui still need to have a squadron guarding; laying Black Hand not successful, Liu Youwang definitely wanted to be removed office investigated punished.

But whether these could have help to their action hard to say. Yi Haoran for a time also hard to make this judgment. But Sanheui’s Camp Manager wanted to harm Captain of National Army Squadron responsible for alert; this matter definitely very beneficial to them; but how to use however was another question.

"Later he didn't say anything with you?"

"Nothing said." Chang Qingyun said.

"Have any change or not?"

"Rather gave me quite a few duties want me manage look after; also want frequently check account inventory," Chang Qingyun smiled bitterly, "Very busy—I am now a figure with face in camp. I assume, he has somewhat meaning of 'Entrusting Heavy Responsibility' to me."

Yi Haoran turned a few circles suddenly said: "I understood—this Liu Youwang is testing using you!"

"Testing using me?!"

"En." Yi Haoran nodded, "You told me last time, Jiang Yougong and he hook up very deep."

"Yes; Jiang Yougong not coming, he can't fish so much silver." Chang Qingyun said once about Jiang Yougong and Liu Youwang’s collusion.

"So said; he wants to see if you can replace Jiang Yougong." Yi Haoran smiled, "If you can replace him, this Liu Youwang will lay Black Hand."

"So it is!" Chang Qingyun suddenly realized; thinking this Liu Youwang looked vulgar; moving hand actually could be so ruthless; couldn't help sweating on back.

"This indeed is an opportunity to take advantage. Just how to avail, Student one time half while also can't think out." Yi Haoran somewhat distressed,
