# Chapter 1: Chang Shide's Defense Against His Charges

Author: Debuchángshī (SB Crew)

Since this is an inquiry hearing, the accused should at least be permitted to respond to the charges.

I, the defendant Chang Shide, hereby submit the following defense against the accusations leveled against me:

**1. The Perils of Commerce Abroad.** This point requires no elaboration.

**2. On the Matter of Integration with Local Society.**

Throughout the Ming Dynasty, merchants who ventured far afield often indulged in certain pleasures along the way. Even those who traded in the unsavory reaches of the northern steppes dallied with Mongolian women—women whose yurts reeked to high heaven the moment their garments fell—hence certain colorful nicknames that circulated among trading circles. Given these precedents, we who serve as the window through which our enterprise presents itself to the outside world, the very bridge connecting us to native society—were we to adopt the celibate airs of Buddhist monks, refusing all integration with the locals or conformity to their customs, we would only invite isolation and even outright rejection.

Consider my actions: I purchased several girls, provided them with food and clothing, gave them gainful employment and exposure to advanced culture, and through them gained valuable insight into the actual lifestyles and habits of the local populace. As for whatever mutually consensual activities may have transpired along the way—even the locals consider such matters perfectly normal. Comrade Wen, on the other hand, clung to his Puritan mask of pristine virtue, only to invite malicious speculation about his preferences. Is *that* what serves our fellow transmigrators' interests?

Learn from this, comrades. *Learn.*

**3. On the Subject of Women and "Our Own People."**

Though we number five hundred, it should be obvious that when the day comes for us to venture among the common folk—to understand their thoughts and habits, to spread our gospel—will we not require "our own people" whom we can trust absolutely? I submit that this is plainly a matter of immense benefit to the great cause of transmigration.

Furthermore, comrades, do not forget: in this era, as masters exercising absolute control over their persons, our possession of them actually works to *their* benefit. It signals that they have earned their master's trust and established a foundation for advancement at his side. I invite everyone to recall that decadent feudal harem fantasy, *Dream of the Red Chamber*—the maids in that novel scheme and plot endlessly for the slightest chance to seduce their masters. Is this not a fine example of healthy, ambitious young women showing admirable initiative?

Thus, on the one hand, this demonstrates their trust in us (bricks fly: "You mean '*you*,' not '*us*'"). And on the other, it demonstrates our trust in them (bricks continue flying: "You mean '*you*,' not '*us*'")...

**4. Defense Regarding the Use of Public Funds.**

I acknowledge the accusation that I used public funds to purchase these girls, but I must clarify certain objective circumstances:

*4.1* When I departed for Leizhou, I left my point coupons and the vast majority of my personal silver behind in Lingao, untouched. Apart from a dozen or so taels of loose silver for petty expenses, I carried only the public funds that Comrade Wen and I jointly managed. Under these circumstances, our residence, our food, our clothing—all depended upon these public funds. But I can assure you that every expenditure, including the money spent on the girls, followed proper usage protocols and reimbursement procedures. (Bricks fly: "Words are cheap—where are the receipts?" "In this era, you can write your own receipts...")

*4.2* As I mentioned, every penny spent on these servants came from public funds. *However!* Have you paused to calculate the total price? A mere fifty taels of silver (according to the discussion in Chapter 49 of Volume Three, the bundled total was ten taels, though here I calculate at ten taels per person). Those of you who have visited the human market know what servant girls typically cost. You also know what wages you must pay hired workers. Now do the arithmetic: for fifty taels, I essentially acquired five female workers while simultaneously establishing Leizhou's internal infrastructure and hospitality apparatus, thereby freeing up considerable manpower for actual productive work. Was that not worth it? I saw girls in the market priced at dozens of taels apiece, dolled up and fair-skinned, but I made no move toward them. Why? Brothers, this is the transmigrators' own silver—how could I not exercise frugality?

*4.3* Back when I lived in the collective dormitories in Lingao, I bunked with everyone else. I remember something said during the pre-crossing training phase—whoever said it may have forgotten, but I remember. (I am pleased to observe certain faces blushing among my accusers.) As a transmigrator, I have earned my rightful share of income since we made landfall—not a fortune, but a respectable sum of silver. Since some of you still find my use of public funds inappropriate, I shall say no more. The situation at the time was that I had no cash on hand; very well then, consider this my repayment to the collective. Deduct the sum from my accumulated wages.

**5. On the Matter of Humanitarianism.**

I, Chang Shide, do not pretend to be a pious saint. Since crossing over, I have fired guns and killed men. I enjoy practicing with my ghost-head saber, and with my dark complexion, I carry an air of menace. But those who know me well understand that I am a gentle, conscientious young man—solid with the brothers, humane even with prisoners.

You have all witnessed the malnourished folk around Lingao—such sights are common in this era. But when I beheld these girls in the market, they were more wasted than the frailest villagers we had ever encountered here, reduced to practically skin-and-bone livestock. (Comrade Wen mutters: "Was it really that bad? They didn't look that terrible when we brought them back.")

We are all youth raised under the red flag, cultivated in New China. When we witness women beaten near death beneath the whips of wicked slave masters, and when we consider that our purpose in coming here—beyond liberating ourselves—is to save the suffering masses still struggling under the evils of feudal society... With such thoughts weighing upon us, who could endure such torment of conscience and still pause to worry about how much money to spend, or whose money it is, in order to rescue them? (Comrade Wen mutters: "Just now you were boasting about your bargaining skills and how little you spent; now you claim you didn't care about the money?")

I simply could not bear to abandon them, so I used the money to purchase their freedom from the traffickers. By the time we brought them to the doorstep of the Leizhou office, one had already fainted from hunger—truly a sight to move the hardest heart to tears. (Comrade Wen mutters: "And there come the tears. Old Chang, you really are quite the performer.")

**6. A Suggestion for Everyone.**

I, Chang, have spoken at length today. On one hand, when I acted previously, circumstances were urgent and I was stationed in a remote outpost, with no opportunity to report in advance. Thus I have now laid out the full sequence of events for everyone. With this understanding, I trust there will be no further criticism directed my way.

On the other hand—ahem—as a former member of the "work by day, self-serve by night" brigade, I have drawn upon my personal experience to conduct, shall we say, an atypical experiment in the domestic bliss of shut-ins, from which certain lessons and insights have emerged. I share these with everyone now. In the future, heh heh, they may prove useful...

I, Chang Shide, rest my defense.
