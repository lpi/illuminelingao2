# Extra 4: The Gun Dealer Plan

*The following account draws upon recent conversations with several transmigrators, augmented by reasonable speculation and publicly available facts. Given the extensive cuts made to related plot points in the physical edition, we have every reason to believe this story will never become official canon. A word of warning to all readers: do not attempt to replicate any actions described herein. No country's law enforcement should be treated lightly.*

## Part One: The Las Vegas Meeting

**Old Timeline, early 21st century. A standard room at the Luxor Hotel, Las Vegas.**

Shi Niaoren extracted a liquor box from a brown paper bag and surveyed the five men gathered in the hotel room. They had traded names online and maintained contact for months, but tonight marked their first meeting in the flesh.

Lin Chuanqing smiled from his seat. "Twelve-year Yamazaki—Boss Shi has refined tastes."

Shi Niaoren laughed and waved off the compliment. "Please, none of that 'boss' talk. It wasn't expensive—just something with decent character." He drew the bottle from its box, cracked the seal, and poured two fingers for each man. Raising his glass, he waited until everyone followed suit. "I'm grateful for your confidence in choosing me as leader. I'll say only this: I will give everything I have. To our great endeavor!"

"Cheers!"

After several rounds, the group loosened, and conversation flowed more freely.

Zhou Weisen tore a strip of American beef jerky, chewed thoughtfully, and spoke. "I'll say what I've been saying all along. Equipping a thousand people? There's no way a handful of us can buy enough by walking into gun stores. Even purchasing a dozen at a time will attract notice."

Silence settled over the room. Of all of them, Zhou Weisen possessed the largest firearms collection. Over the years, every dollar not spent on dating had gone toward weapons. When it came to gun knowledge, they all deferred to Old Zhou. As he had explained in their WeChat group, Americans owning a hundred firearms wasn't unusual—but collectors typically acquired many types in small quantities, accumulated over decades. Investors might stockpile certain models for appreciation, but they focused on historically significant pieces with premium value. If they were to purchase common AKs and SKS rifles in bulk over a short period to meet their crossing needs—*that* would raise immediate alarms.

Qian Shuiting considered this. "If legal channels won't work, what about... other channels?"

Every eye turned to Lin Chuanqing, who hastily waved his hands in protest.

"Brothers, it's not that I don't want to help. These waters run too deep!"

Lin Chuanqing elaborated. Over the years he had heard countless stories and witnessed a few incidents firsthand, but reality bore little resemblance to what people imagined. He knew of street-level "retailers," but warehouses stuffed with weapons like something from the movies simply didn't exist. Black-market firearms came from two primary sources: theft and cheap smuggling. Stolen guns meant taking whatever was available—supply was never guaranteed. Smuggled goods had no quality standards; you could only hope they fired without exploding in your hands. Street shootouts were about using a weapon once and discarding it to avoid leaving evidence. Gangsters didn't concern themselves with accuracy. So street retailers were out of the question. As for more organized sources—those were crime syndicates himself. Approaching them would be worse than walking into the sea.

"The way I see it," Qian Shuixie said, downing his whiskey in one motion, "law-abiding citizens like us looking for underground channels is asking to die. Better to fly directly to Eastern Europe and buy by the crate."

"What, just show up with a suitcase full of cash?" Chen Sigen asked skeptically. He doubted it could be that straightforward.

Zhou Weisen shook his head. "We're not part of that world. It's not so simple." He lifted his glass. "In my view, there's only one viable path—what I've been advocating all along. We become gun dealers ourselves. Use the business to support our collection. Sell to others while building our own stockpile."

The group exchanged uncertain glances. Zhou Weisen's approach had its merits, but none of them had ever attempted anything like this. How treacherous were these waters?

After a prolonged silence, Zhou Weisen spoke again. "I've been researching this extensively and have some findings to share." He retrieved a laptop and projector from his suitcase, aimed the image at the wall, and launched into his presentation.

**Step One: Obtain a federal firearms license.** Regulations varied by state, but in jurisdictions with looser gun control, the process was relatively simple. First came identity requirements—applicants needed US citizenship or permanent residency. Then it was a matter of completing forms, submitting fingerprints and photographs to the ATF, and securing a location to serve as the store. After an ATF agent conducted an interview and inspected the premises, the license would arrive in roughly sixty days. Even without a proper storefront, if the owner could demonstrate safe firearm storage at their residence, that sufficed.

**Step Two: Store renovation and stocking.** This phase they understood fairly well. Lin Chuanqing had helped countless friends open shops in Chinatown; he'd witnessed the store-opening process more times than he could count. The Qian brothers and Zhou Weisen all knew people who ran businesses—standing behind a counter shouldn't prove too difficult. In principle, opening a supermarket to sell vegetables wasn't fundamentally different from opening a gun shop to sell guns—at least firearms didn't spoil. As for inventory, once they held the FFL, they could join dealer networks and order from major wholesalers. New stores lacking credit history might not secure the best prices, and payment terms would be stricter, but manageable.

"By Step Three, once the business runs smoothly, we can either accumulate stock gradually through regular operations or place a large order just before we leave. Either approach will work." Zhou Weisen concluded with evident satisfaction.

After further discussion, they could conjure no superior alternative. Opening a gun shop appeared to be their only option. Lin Chuanqing held US citizenship; the others possessed green cards—identity requirements were satisfied. All were essentially law-abiding citizens; passing background checks wouldn't be problematic. The location still required selection, but the more pressing concern was capital. If they pooled their resources completely, they could probably assemble over a million dollars. But running a gun shop was a long-term enterprise, and no reasonable person would abandon their livelihood entirely for a business venture. To avoid attracting ATF scrutiny, they could contribute only readily available funds—treating it as an ordinary business investment. This reduced their capital to roughly $300,000—insufficient for a proper gun shop. They would need support from back home in China.

That evening, Shi Niaoren reported their conclusions to the China group, immediately drawing attention from the highest echelons. Heavyweights like Wen, Ma, and Xiao convened a video conference within hours, demanding details. Days later came another, lengthier online session. This time the questions were more granular, the responses more carefully considered. Before the meeting concluded, Transmigration Company members voted unanimously to provide the North America group with $500,000 in startup capital. Combined with what they could contribute themselves, this would suffice to establish a modest gun shop in many locations. Xiao Zishan further proposed that the North America group establish a shooting range and develop tourism experiences—"shooting packages" and "hunting adventures"—with the China side responsible for sending customers. Naturally, these customers would include members of the Transmigration Company's own Military Division. The financial transactions between China and America would also serve conveniently as a conduit for subsequent funding.

## Part Two: Establishing the Gun Shop

With the plan agreed upon, the North America group threw themselves into action. Zhou Weisen was unanimously selected as the gun shop's proprietor, and he accepted without hesitation. Lin Chuanqing accompanied him on reconnaissance trips across the American West. After surveying numerous locations, they concluded that Las Vegas was ideal. The city's firearms market was remarkably robust—a metropolis of half a million residents supported dozens of gun shops. Indoor ranges dotted the city proper, and venture slightly into the surrounding desert and outdoor ranges became available for rental. Among so many establishments, their operation would scarcely draw attention. Furthermore, if they intended to run a tourism-oriented range, they needed to be somewhere Chinese tourists actually visited. Beyond the East and West Coasts, Las Vegas was the only such destination in America's interior. There was also a certain psychological appropriateness to tourists visiting the decadent imperial city of casinos, then experiencing traditional American martial culture through shooting.

Fortune favored them. A gun shop location became available for lease. According to records, the previous owner was wanted for allegedly supplying weapons to Mexican drug cartels, and his property had been seized. Since the incident struck suddenly, the shop had been fully operational when police sealed it—interior renovation and gun vault remained completely intact. Now that the case had essentially concluded, the storefront had reverted to the property owner, but he couldn't afford to renovate for other purposes and had found no takers. This suited Zhou and Lin perfectly. After negotiation, they signed the lease.

One day, soon-to-be gun shop owner Zhou Weisen was supervising renovation work—honestly, there was little to do beyond cosmetic touch-ups and rearranging the layout according to feng shui principles—when someone knocked at the door. He answered to find a white man of modest height and slender build, elderly but with a good-natured, stubble-covered face that spoke of years spent dealing with customers.

"Sir, I'd like to speak with the owner of this establishment."

"That's me."

"Sir, I'd like to apply for a position at your gun shop."

Zhou Weisen was genuinely surprised. He hadn't even begun searching for employees, hadn't posted a single job listing. Questioning revealed that the old man, named Bob, had worked at this very shop for years. When the previous owner fled after his legal troubles, Bob had lost his position. He was of course entirely ignorant of his employer's crimes—the new owner needn't worry about his reliability. Zhou Weisen was puzzled; with so many gun shops in the casino city, finding work shouldn't be difficult. Further inquiry revealed that Bob and his wife both suffered chronic illnesses and required the health insurance of a full-time position to maintain treatment. Bob had spent over twenty years in the local industry, and everyone knew his history. People were willing to offer temporary positions, but jobs providing long-term health benefits weren't simply available on demand. When he heard the old shop had been leased again—and to a Chinese person—he'd come to try his luck.

Zhou Weisen saw the value in having a local expert. He posed all the questions he'd accumulated during his research, and the old man answered fluently and sensibly. In the end, Zhou Weisen was thoroughly satisfied and had Bob sign an employment contract on the spot. The employee health insurance was already in place, resolving Bob's major concern. Following Zhou Weisen's instructions, Bob recruited several former colleagues, and they set to work.

A little over a month later, "Lucky Star Collectible Firearms and Ammo," owned by Mr. Zhou Weisen, officially opened for business. On the business license and mailing address, it was listed simply as "Lucky Star Collectibles"—no mention of firearms or ammunition. This was Old Bob's suggestion. The greatest risk in shipping firearms was internal theft by postal and shipping workers. Gang members embedded in the US postal system would check package addresses in large warehouses; if they spotted words like "firearms" or "weapons," they would alert outside accomplices who would intercept the packages and resell the contents. Zhou Weisen would never have imagined such things—in China, this was inconceivable. But the US had its own particular circumstances, and internal theft in ground transportation had been an entrenched problem for decades. With so many hands in postal warehouses, package theft was routine. The postal service's only countermeasure was to recommend registered mail and advise against labeling packages as "firearms." The prominent sign outside the store, of course, displayed "Firearms and Ammunition" in enormous letters. Following American convention, a large roadside sign faced the street, and for clusters of commercial buildings, an even larger shared sign stood at the parking entrance. Zhou Weisen was willing to spend generously—he paid extra for double-sized signage with lettering visible from hundreds of meters away.

Adhering to the traditional Chinese principle of thin margins and rapid turnover, Lucky Star's merchandise was generally priced slightly below competitors. American shop owners often said, "If I can't make a hundred bucks on this sale, I won't take it." Zhou Weisen would accept any transaction that brought in a few dozen dollars, so long as it exceeded the manufacturer's minimum advertised price—he would simply work harder. He focused primarily on common items: AKs, ARs, and popular handgun models. After several months, while profit margins remained modest, his volume was unmistakably growing.

With a few months of operation behind him, Zhou Weisen began to appreciate the gun shop industry's subtleties. On one hand, a gun shop was merely a specialty retail store, not fundamentally different from electronics or audio equipment shops. The same retail tedium applied: cleaning, organizing merchandise and shelves, taking inventory, while handling a parade of customers—most reasonable, but always a few difficult ones. Some pretended expertise they didn't possess, constantly displaying unreliable knowledge before staff. Others were impossibly particular with all manner of peculiar requests. Many handled numerous firearms and purchased nothing. Thankfully, Old Bob was there to manage situations, defusing awkward moments with a few well-chosen words and typically leaving customers satisfied. Old Bob often told Zhou Weisen, "Boss! Relax—a gun shop is just a retail store!"

Yet when Zhou Weisen observed everyone's holstered pistols, he found this somewhat ironic. This was the trade's other face. What they sold were, after all, instruments of death—beneath the friendly exterior, a vigilant heart must always remain alert. All staff members were armed while on duty, without exception, openly wearing holsters with Glocks or Smith & Wessons on their belts or thighs. Behind the counter, hidden from customer view, lay semi-automatic shotguns and AR-15s within easy reach. According to Old Bob and the others, in their combined forty-plus years working in gun shops, they had never encountered a robber foolish enough to attempt hitting one. But preparedness was the true principle of this profession. This wasn't merely about preventing robbery but also guarding against various schemes. In just a few months, Zhou Weisen encountered several individuals who tried to purchase guns despite knowing they had criminal records—a quick background check revealed them, and they were immediately shown the door. Once, a suspicious-looking man brought a woman who seemed utterly clueless about firearms; a few probing questions revealed she was actually buying for her "boyfriend." That wasn't permitted either—both were promptly sent away. According to Old Bob, the ATF sometimes deployed undercover agents to test shop owners, so those running gun shops had to operate strictly by the book and never grow clever enough to burn themselves. Of course, his former employer, who'd been supplying weapons to cartels, had been too deceptive—who could have guessed? Listening to all this, Zhou Weisen couldn't help contemplating his own true purpose for opening the gun shop, and broke into a cold sweat.

## Part Three: Selecting Equipment

With the gun shop running smoothly, they could begin their original plan. The first task: determine targets for acquisition. This proved no simple matter. The transmigrators back in China posed a particular challenge—only a handful had regular access to real firearms. The vast majority had fired a few rounds during university military training and nothing since, their experience limited to airsoft replicas. This didn't deter a vocal minority of keyboard weapons experts from publishing endless pontificating online. Zhou Weisen sometimes shook his head at the questionable "data" and "theories" of dubious origin proliferating on the internal forum. In his view, while long guns still required discussion, for handguns there was really only one choice: the Glock series. Only Glock could satisfy all requirements for reliability, longevity, availability, and price.

Glock's reliability was beyond dispute—numerous US law enforcement agencies with impeccable martial virtue relied on them, and complaints about reliability were seldom heard. Its dependability was widely acknowledged as comparable to HK, with other brands falling notably short. Regarding longevity, Glock guaranteed over ten thousand rounds of service life—far exceeding what the China-based members could appreciate. Military firearms didn't require such extended lifespans; several thousand rounds would suffice. But for their grand plan, this was a clear advantage. After crossing over, who knew how long it would take to climb the technological ladder high enough to manufacture Glocks—perhaps a century. A Glock that could be passed down through generations was excellent indeed. As for availability, no explanation was necessary—Glocks were ubiquitous. Manufacturers producing accessories and attachments for Glocks were equally everywhere. Zhou Weisen judged from his own store's sales that ordering several dozen at once would present no difficulty, and once their volume increased, ordering one or two hundred at a time should also prove feasible. Finally, regarding price, wholesale costs for various Glock models ranged from around $300 to just over $400—entirely within everyone's expectations.

What he hadn't anticipated was the ferocity of the keyboard experts' verbal warfare. The forum accumulated various charges against Glocks: the absence of an external safety made them prone to accidental discharge, poor ergonomics made them awkward to hold, they supposedly couldn't withstand Yellow River water, plastic components would definitely crack in severe cold—the accusations were endless. Zhou Weisen initially attempted patient responses, addressing each concern in turn, but eventually discovered that some people were simply contrarian echo chambers. There was also outright absurdity: claims that Glock-fired casings couldn't be reloaded, that Glocks were so complex you couldn't reassemble them after disassembly, that failing to clean one for a year would seize the slide—all manner of bizarre assertions. He eventually abandoned efforts to persuade the forum masses and instead focused on far more productive exchanges with leadership and Military Division core members.

While the casual transmigrators debated which weapons were cooler and more advanced, the leadership was weighing trade-offs across time scales spanning decades, and the operational Military Division members concerned themselves with practical questions of logistics, supply, maintenance, and management. It was easy to imagine that until the transmigrators established a powerful native army under their command, every transmigrator—regardless of gender or specialty—might need to bear arms. Even after establishing such an army, they would need to maintain a core force of absolutely loyal personnel wielding absolutely overwhelming firepower for an extended period. Even the steam-obsessed Boss Ma himself had to acknowledge this reality. After all, assault rifles and semi-automatic pistols were somewhat more effective than Minié rifles and revolvers.

With this premise established, the transmigrators' firearms needed to satisfy both short-term requirements for establishing a foothold and long-term requirements for maintaining military advantage. This couldn't involve merely a handful of firearms plus ammunition—they needed complete capability. Modern firearms generally boasted long service lives, so spare parts requirements weren't too demanding. But ammunition was another matter entirely. Finished ammunition was heavy—including packaging, eighty thousand rounds of 9mm weighed approximately a ton, and rifle ammunition was heavier still. Zhou Weisen estimated he could acquire at most a million rounds of various types—already around twenty tons, presenting enormous storage, transport, and loading challenges for the few people in the North America group. This million rounds seemed impressive, but a single thousand-person engagement would consume at least tens of thousands, and the Military Division's basic marksmanship maintenance would consume at least that much annually. A million rounds would be exhausted within a few years—the transmigrators would need to reload and eventually manufacture ammunition from scratch.

On this foundation, leadership and the North America group engaged in intensive discussions during video conferences. Xi Yazhou spoke first. "I think we can rule out M43 ammunition. Corrosive powder, steel cases, Berdan primers—it's all traps."

Zhou Weisen agreed. "We won't touch Soviet military surplus. Their commercial ammunition does use non-corrosive powder, but the cases and primers present genuine difficulties."

He Ming offered a thought. "How about spending more on brass-cased ammunition for reloading? We can't do without AKs and SKS rifles."

Qian Shuiting shook his head. "It's not that simple. AKs are designed for steel-cased ammunition; their bolt action is violent with loose manufacturing tolerances. Brass cases often can't withstand it and cause malfunctions."

"So then..." Xi Yazhou was clearly unsatisfied with this response.

Zhou Weisen presented his research findings. "I believe manufacturing steel-cased ammunition is currently beyond our capability. Equipment exists in Eastern Europe and Russia, but those production lines are designed for annual outputs exceeding a hundred million rounds—the investment and manpower required would be far too great for us, and raw materials would prove difficult to source. Because the market is flooded with cheap steel-cased ammunition, no market exists for small-scale steel-cased production equipment, and therefore no ready-made products to purchase."

"Have the Mechanical Division investigate?" Everyone naturally considered the next step.

Xiao Zishan interrupted the discussion at the opportune moment. "Comrades—let's step back and examine this from a higher vantage point, shall we?" He raised one finger. "First—to ensure we have ammunition for the long term, we need to manufacture our own, correct?"

Everyone agreed.

"To manufacture ammunition, we must solve a series of problems from raw materials to machinery. Can these challenges wait until after we've crossed?"

Zhou Weisen responded immediately. "Once we cross, we'll be building from nothing. Trying to solve this afterward could take who knows how long. I think we can bring some raw materials, but not too much—once depleted, we'll need to source locally. Machinery and equipment, if properly maintained after transport, should last decades without significant problems."

"So we can begin working on machinery and equipment now, and also stockpile some raw materials?"

No one objected to this reasoning.

Xiao Zishan raised a second finger. "Another consideration—examining our needs, there are really two components. First is the armament requirement for initial post-crossing armed struggle: ensuring everyone is armed with sufficient ammunition. This is urgent and critical. Second is long-term technical superiority—also critical, but perhaps we have more time to address it. For example, this steel-cased ammunition challenge—after five years of groundwork, could we begin addressing it at the ten-year mark?"

"Comrades, the War of Resistance lasted only eight years." Zhong Lishi interjected. "I've been studying history. The Eighth Route Army's conditions were incredibly harsh, yet they used copper coins to press cartridge cases and ceramic vats to produce sulfuric acid. We've assembled a group of master's and doctoral graduates here—if we can't develop a cartridge case solution in ten years, that would be rather embarrassing."

Xi Yazhou spoke up immediately. "I believe ammunition is of paramount importance. One could argue it determines what weapons we select and what path we follow. I propose we proceed on two fronts: our North America group continues searching for solutions, while back home the Mechanical Division begins early preparations."

## Part Four: Training and Selection

*(The story continues with detailed accounts of the first training group arriving from China, extensive shooting drills at the desert range, discussions about rifle selection between the M21 and T91, the establishment of ammunition manufacturing capabilities, and the elaborate security precautions taken to avoid ATF attention. The transmigrators conduct multi-day tactical shooting exercises, test various firearms including SCAR-L, AUG, and CZ805, and ultimately settle on the T91 as their primary rifle due to its lighter weight and excellent optical sight integration.)*

---

## Part Five: Building Manufacturing Capability

Zhou Weisen received his manufacturer's license after multiple ATF interviews. He established "Nevada Star Armory" (NVSA), installed CNC machining capabilities for AR lower receivers, and commenced component production. Two Mechanical Division members arrived from China under cover as "after-sales service technicians" and helped establish the manufacturing line—including the capability to restore surplus machine guns like the SG-43 and PKM variants.

The operation's key lay in using legitimate business activities as cover: the gun shop sold retail firearms, the shooting range provided tourist experiences, and the manufacturing division produced civilian-legal components. Meanwhile, stockpiles of ammunition, firearms, and equipment gradually accumulated for the eventual crossing.

---

## Part Six: Complications

The operation encountered a serious obstacle when the ATF, acting on Treasury Department suspicions about Lin Chuanqing's financial activities, initiated an investigation of the Lucky Star gun shop. During an intense interview, Zhou Weisen faced pointed questions about his business partner's past Triad connections. The ATF issued an ultimatum: either report on Lin's activities, or buy him out of the partnership.

To preserve the operation, the transmigrators restructured their ownership arrangement. Lin Chuanqing's $400,000 stake was purchased out, forcing the business to relocate to smaller premises and pivot primarily to online sales. Though this setback strained resources, it also allowed them to operate further beneath the radar.

Zhou Weisen adapted by implementing aggressive e-commerce strategies—approaches his traditional competitors hadn't embraced. The new model actually proved more efficient for their purposes, enabling them to accumulate stockpiles while maintaining plausible business cover.

---

## Part Seven: Acquisitions and Preparations

When Zhou Weisen learned of a batch of Russian military surplus Mosin-Nagant rifles arriving at Long Beach, the China-based transmigrators responded with enthusiasm. Three crates containing 720 rifles were purchased at $60 each. Zhou also acquired 500 additional rifles that had been contaminated by chemicals—these were cleaned, and those that couldn't be properly restored were slated for transport to the new timeline regardless.

The transmigrators' preparations accelerated:

- **Handguns**: 200 Glock 17s for the Military Division, 200 Glock 19s and 26s for general personnel, plus holsters, spare magazines, and accessories
- **Rifles**: Several hundred T91 upper receivers with heavy barrels, tactical furniture, and optics; hundreds of M21s (semi-automatic AK variants) for general distribution
- **Machine guns**: Five restored SG-43s (three half-auto conversions, two full-auto), plus multiple PKM variants undergoing restoration
- **Ammunition**: Stockpiles approaching one million rounds across 9mm, 5.56x45, 7.62x54R, and .22LR
- **Manufacturing capability**: Complete reloading equipment, bullet and case manufacturing tools, primer and powder production capability in containerized laboratory format

Training groups continued arriving from China under various cover stories—corporate retreats, bachelor parties, security company exercises. Each group underwent intensive shooting instruction, progressing from basic marksmanship through tactical operations.

---

## Epilogue

As D-Day approached, the North America group had successfully established the complete logistics chain the transmigrators would require. The legitimate businesses provided cover; the stockpiles provided capability; the training provided competence. When the time came to load everything onto the ships arranged through Lin Chuanqing's shipping contacts, they would be ready.

The gun dealer plan had evolved far beyond the simple concept of purchasing firearms at retail. Through manufacturing licenses, wholesale import capabilities, and restoration of surplus equipment, they had assembled an arsenal worthy of a small army—all while remaining (mostly) within the letter of American law.

*Just as the Transmigration Company's leadership had envisioned from the beginning: leverage America's uniquely permissive firearms culture to solve the otherwise impossible problem of arming a thousand people for the colonization of an unprepared past. The only question remaining was whether their preparations would prove sufficient for whatever awaited them in 1628.*
