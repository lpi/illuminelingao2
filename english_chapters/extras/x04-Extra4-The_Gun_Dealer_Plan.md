The following story is written based on recent discussions with several Senators, combined with appropriate imagination and a large amount of public facts. Given the significant cuts to relevant plot points in the physical book compared to the web version, we have reason to believe that the following story will never become canon. The author also wishes to warn all you 'rough embryos' not to imitate any plot points within; no country's dictatorship machine is to be trifled with.

The Old Timeline, a certain day in the early 21st century. Inside a standard guest room at the Luxor Hotel in Las Vegas.

Shi Niaoren fished a wine box out of a brown paper bag and looked at the five men sitting in the room. They had long known each other's names and had been in contact online for months, but this was their first time meeting in person.

Lin Chuanqing smiled from the side: "12-year-old Yamazaki whisky. Boss Shi has good taste."

Shi Niaoren smiled too. "What boss? Don't laugh at me. It's not worth much, just for the taste." Saying so, he took the bottle out of the box, cracked open the cap, and poured two fingers of alcohol for everyone. He raised his own glass, and the others raised theirs in response. "Thank you all for thinking highly of me and electing me as the leader. I, Shi, have nothing else to say but that I will do my utmost. Cheers to our grand plan!"

"Cheers!"

After three rounds of drinks, everyone slowly relaxed, and the atmosphere warmed up.

Zhou Weisen tore off a strip of American beef jerky and put it in his mouth. After chewing a few times, he spoke. "I still stand by what I said. Equipment for a thousand people—it's impossible for just the few of us to buy enough from gun shops! Even if we only buy a dozen or so at a time, I'm afraid it would be very conspicuous!"

Everyone fell silent. Zhou Weisen was the one with the most gun collection among them. Over the years, apart from chasing girls, his income had all gone into arms. When it came to knowledge about firearms, they all had to listen to Old Zhou. According to what Zhou Weisen said in the WeChat group, collectors in the US owning hundreds of guns were not rare, but buying guns for collection purposes usually meant buying small quantities of many types, accumulated over many years. Even for investment collection based on appreciation potential, it was limited to boutique firearms with historical value. If they were to buy large quantities of common trash like AKs and SKSs in a short time to meet the military needs of the transmutation, that would indeed be glaringly obvious.

Qian Shuiting thought for a moment. "If legal channels are hard to work with, what about other channels?" As soon as these words came out, everyone's eyes focused on Lin Chuanqing, scaring him into waving his hands repeatedly.

"Brothers, it's not that I don't want to help. The water here is too deep! Too deep!"

Lin Chuanqing expressed that he had heard quite a few stories over the years and had seen some things with his own eyes, but it really wasn't what everyone imagined. He knew about the street-level firearms "retailers," but it was absolutely impossible for them to have a warehouse full of arms like in the movies. The sources of these black guns were mainly two: stolen goods and smuggled cheap products. Stolen guns—well, you get what was stolen, so there's no guarantee of supply. Smuggled ones—there's no such thing as quality; as long as it bangs and doesn't explode in your face, that's it. Street gunfights are about dumping the gun after shooting to leave no evidence, so gangsters don't consider accuracy problems. Therefore, finding street "retailers" won't work. Of course, there are some "friends" who need a lot of regular firearms, which would be organized gangs. Going to them would be less painless than just jumping into the sea yourself.

"I think, for law-abiding citizens like us to go find some underground channel, that's just seeking death. Why not go directly to Eastern European countries to buy, buying crate after crate?" Qian Shuixie downed the wine in his glass and spoke carelessly.

"Then, do we carry a suitcase of cash directly over there?" Chen Sigen asked in confusion. He felt things couldn't be that simple.

Zhou Weisen shook his head. "We are not people of that circle; it's not that easy." He lifted his wine glass. "In my opinion, there is only the path I mentioned: obtaining a Federal Firearms License; sustaining the collection by trading—selling while collecting for ourselves."

Everyone looked at each other in dismay. Zhou Weisen's method did seem feasible, but none of them had ever done it. How deep was the water here?

After a while, seeing that no one made a sound, Zhou Weisen spoke up. "I've done some research during this time and gained some insights. Let me show you." With that, he dragged out a laptop and a projector from his small suitcase, projected a PPT onto the wall of the room, and began to explain to everyone.

The first step is to apply for a firearms dealer license. The regulations vary from place to place, but it is very easy in places with looser gun control. First is the identity requirement—must be a US citizen or Green Card holder. Then fill out the form, submit fingerprints and photos to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), and at the same time prepare the venue intended for the gun shop. Wait for the ATF to interview the shop owner, confirm the storefront, and then wait another sixty days to get the license. Even if there is no storefront, if the owner can safely store firearms at home, it can also pass.

The second step, shop decoration and stocking up. Everyone was actually not unfamiliar with this step. Lin Chuanqing didn't know how many friends he had helped open shops in Chinatown, and had seen the opening process countless times. The Qian brothers and Zhou Weisen also had friends who opened shops to do business. Although they hadn't done counter work, they thought it wouldn't be difficult. In principle, opening a supermarket to sell vegetables is not that different from opening a gun shop to sell guns—at least with firearms, you don't have to worry about them expiring or going bad! For stocking, once you get the dealer license, you can join the internal distribution network of gun dealers and get goods from large wholesalers. It's just that new shops haven't established credit, so the prices aren't that favorable, and the payment terms are stricter.

"By the third step, once we get the business on track, whether we slowly accumulate during business operations or order a huge batch before we leave, it will be easy to handle!" Zhou Weisen concluded with confidence.
