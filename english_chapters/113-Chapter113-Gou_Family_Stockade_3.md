# Chapter 113 - Gou Family Stockade (3)

Lin Quan'an was forced into a corner, realizing that earning money from the Short-haired Masters was not that easy. He said: "Your honor's accent is still a bit strange. It's better to speak less once inside."

Arriving in front of the stockade, the gate was open. There were abatis blocking the front, and several village braves were standing guard. Village braves were also watching from the sentry tower. The defense was quite tight. Because Lin Quan'an was familiar with the locals, he greeted them and slipped some small items, then took Xue Ziliang inside.

There were about two hundred households in the stockade, mostly with stone walls and thatched roofs. There were also poor ones with walls and roofs woven from bamboo. Xue Ziliang found it very strange seeing this. However, he wasn't here for sightseeing; he just memorized the appearance and direction of the roads. There were few pedestrians in the village, only some old and young, probably all gone to work.

Lin Quan'an shook his rattle drum as he walked. Seeing him coming, women gathered around to buy some needles and threads. Those without money exchanged eggs and rice noodles. In a short while, he had quite a lot of things piled on him. Xue Ziliang followed Lin Quan'an and circled almost the entire stockade. The whole stockade had only one gate. The stockade wall was only a little over three meters high, rammed with earth and stone, very solid, showing almost no signs of peeling or erosion, simply as solid as concrete. Several wooden enemy towers were built sparsely on the stockade wall. Defensive equipment like stones and logs could be seen piled on the wall, and there seemed to be firearms like cannons too. There were no defensive facilities inside the stockade. The so-called inner stockade wall was just a relatively tall courtyard wall—more than ten households of the Gou family's main clan were concentrated in those connected mansions. For fire prevention, the entire residence was separated from the surrounding dwellings by wide streets. At first glance, it felt a bit like a stockade within a stockade.

But looking closely, this courtyard wall was not simple. Although he heard people say there were more than ten Gou family mansions there, there were only two gates for entry and exit: the main gate on the south and the back gate on the north. Facing the street in front was a tall gate tower. On both sides of the gate tower were brick-wrapped eaves and inverted seating enclosure rooms. Gun holes were opened on the back wall, allowing firing of blunderbusses and fowling pieces outward. The very thick elm wood gate was wrapped with iron sheets and nailed with rows of big-headed pig iron nails, impossible to chop open with axes. The back gate was small and solid. The wall was built with stones, about four meters high. Looking at the stones at the base of the wall, it wouldn't be thin.

However, these obstacles were not worth mentioning for the transmigrators. Xue Ziliang even felt that his personal reconnaissance was a bit superfluous. With the little firepower of the military group, breaking the stockade was a piece of cake. The only difficulty was how to open the stockade gate. The stockade gate was wooden, very heavy, and had a huge door bar behind it. It would be best to blow it open directly, but the military group had no demolition equipment. Maybe burn it with oil?

Leaving the stockade, Xue Ziliang returned to the woods, recorded every key point he saw in his notebook, and drew a map of the interior. People remaining in the woods also took some exterior photos with telephoto lenses.

Wang Ruixiang said to Xue Ziliang: "Let's launch the reconnaissance plane to take some data."

Xue Ziliang originally felt it was a bit redundant, but thinking that the situation inside the inner residence was not very clear, and attacking the inner residence after breaking the stockade would take some effort, it wouldn't do to be unfamiliar with the road environment, so he agreed. Hearing this, Wang Ruixiang rubbed his hands in excitement and went to assemble the big model airplane.

This thing was huge. It took three people to carry it even when disassembled. Plus a pile of miscellaneous accessories, fuel, a set of cameras, and a laptop for receiving signals, several people quickly assembled the large model airplane. However, they discovered a problem only after assembling it. There was no concrete ground here!

This kind of large model airplane, unlike small remote-controlled planes, needed a runway to take off and land. In modern times, finding a flat area was effortless; even in remote rural areas, there were always roads or concrete drying grounds. Flat playgrounds or grasslands would also do in a pinch, but at this moment, none of these conditions existed.

It would be possible to level a piece of land outside the woods on the spot, but firstly they had no tools, and secondly, making such a big commotion on open ground would definitely attract patrolling people. Helplessly, they had to pack up their things disappointedly and return. The first aerial reconnaissance operation ended in failure like this.

"Must develop a rocket-assisted take-off system!" Wang Ruixiang said hatefully.

"Let's go back. On the way, watch for an opportunity to grab two people!"

"Grab tongues (prisoners)?"

"Correct." Xue Ziliang was already familiar with this Chinese jargon, "Some things are only clear when asking them."

"Done!" A group of people rubbed their hands, except for the dejected Wang Ruixiang.

Xue Ziliang divided the people into two groups, ambushing in the woods on both sides of the road. This place was neither far nor near the stockade, allowing sufficient time to retreat and avoiding accidental capture of irrelevant personnel. To avoid causing too much alarm, they decided to use knives and Wang Ruixiang's short crossbow if force was needed.

The weather in Lingao, regardless of spring, summer, autumn, or winter, could reach around thirty degrees during the day in autumn and winter. Staying in the airless woods, several people were sweating all over. Although they applied insect repellent, various flying insects, mosquitoes, and flies still kept biting them, making the few new recruits complain incessantly. Fortunately, the arduous training of more than a month had cultivated their willpower, and no one moved around randomly.

There were sporadic people walking on the road, but no characters worth capturing. After a long time, they saw a small sedan chair with bamboo poles coming on the road, covered with a blue cloth canvas awning. A master-like person lay sprawled on it, followed by a dozen family guards and attendants. There was also a maid-like figure, holding a bundle in her hand, walking beside the sedan chair.

Ye Mengyan was a bit nervous and hurriedly crawled over to ask Xue Ziliang: "Captain, a big guy is coming!"

Xue Ziliang nodded. Without asking, this was a big shot from Gou Family Stockade. It might even be Gou the Elder himself. Excluding the guide, their side had four people, with a considerable chance of winning.

He pondered for a moment and looked at Lin Quan'an. The peddler shuddered—every time this Short-hair Master looked at him like this, nothing good happened. Sure enough, Xue Ziliang called him over again.

The person sitting on the sedan chair was none other than the second master of the Gou family, the underworld boss of Lingao County living in the city, Gou Xunli. He recently received news that the pirates from Bairen Beach had reached Maniao Salt Field. This Gou Xunli had studied some books and had been associating with the government and monopolizing lawsuits in the county town for many years, so he had some insight. He knew that Maniao Salt Field was a major source of wealth for the county. His brother Gou Xunyi spent a lot of effort to control the salt field. The bandits sending a small team to the salt field was needless to say to snatch this piece of fat meat. A few days ago, he heard from people in the government office that the bandits sent someone to see Advisor Wang, asking to monopolize the salt tax. Gou the Second knew things were bad and hurriedly ordered a sedan chair to return to the stockade—countermeasures must be proposed as soon as possible.

Unlike Gou Xunyi, in modern terms, his eating manners were not so ugly. He knew to leave some leeway in everything, so although he was also a feared character in the county, his reputation was not too bad. In comparison, Gou Xunyi was a tyrannical figure who wanted to take advantage whether reasonable or not, fearing only that he didn't do bad things thoroughly or cruelly enough. Gou Xunli was a bit worried about his big brother. This short-haired pirate was not an ordinary small bandit. If a conflict arose, the Gou family would definitely suffer a big loss.

Gou Xunli planned to persuade Gou Xunyi to send someone to talk to the bandits as soon as possible, ceding part of the salt field's interests to make money amicably. He guessed that the bandits had the idea of entrenching in Lingao for a long time. They were powerful. If he could cling to them, suffering a small loss now might not be a bad thing. Just as he was turning this thought, thinking about how to persuade his irritable big brother, the sedan chair suddenly stopped. He opened his eyes and asked: "What's going on?"

The head of the family guards came over and replied: "There is a peddler on the road saying he wants to cry out injustice."

Gou Xunli cursed: "Bastard." He thought this was mostly likely the family guards or village braves of the stockade robbing a peddler again. These bandits only knew lawlessness and didn't even understand the principle that rabbits don't eat grass around their burrows. He waved his hand in annoyance: "Drive him away."

Just as he spoke, a bowstring twanged by the roadside. A crossbow bolt had already sunk into the sedan bearer's neck. His eyes rolled up, and both man and sedan chair overturned on the ground. The group was instantly thrown into chaos.

With a whistle, four people rushed out from the roadside, waving gleaming short knives in their hands. Before the guarding family guards could draw their swords, their throats were slit and they fell to the ground, blood gushing from their necks, dying immediately. This change happened so fast that people couldn't react. Several family guards were so panicked they forgot to draw their swords, swinging their scabbards to smash and chop at the comers.

Ye Mengyan didn't have time to savor the taste of killing for the first time. Seeing a family guard with a ferocious face rushing towards him waving a sheathed sword, he couldn't help backing up a few steps, tripped over a corpse on the ground, and sat down on his butt—a wave of fear in his heart, Mom, I'm going to die! His mind was in a daze, but his hand subconsciously stabbed out fiercely. The sharp pointed knife pierced into the opponent's stomach like cutting tofu, disappearing up to the handle easily. Ye Mengyan watched as the person in front of him, eyes wide open and face twisted, collapsed dejectedly, intestines flowing out from under his body. Immediately, his stomach turned upside down, and he spewed out the compressed dry rations he ate at noon in one mouthful, shooting far and accurately, hitting right on the face of the maid lying under the sedan chair in panic. The little girl, frightened immobile by the scene before her, received this sour and smelly "facial shot." How could she distinguish anything anymore? She fainted on the spot.

Although the family guards were numerous, they were completely unprepared. Four died in one round of assault, and arrows kept shooting from the grass. No one had the will to fight, fleeing in all directions. Six corpses and two wounded were left on the ground, and three captives were caught alive, including a maid. Regrettably, the master sitting on the sedan chair fled the moment the sedan overturned, moving as fast as a rabbit.

Xue Ziliang ordered not to take the wounded and the woman, tie up the captives and leave quickly. Ye Mengyan saw the girl had delicate features and insisted on taking her. Xue Ziliang was annoyed but had to ask a captive to carry the girl, and the group retreated quickly. After all, these people were not professional soldiers. After killing, they inevitably felt flustered. They drove the captives to run wildly all the way, not even feeling tired. Seeing the team members' faces turning very bad, Xue Ziliang hurriedly contacted Bairen City with the radio, asking them to send a vehicle to meet them. By the time they returned to the camp, before completing the handover and writing the report, several people had already started vomiting violently.
