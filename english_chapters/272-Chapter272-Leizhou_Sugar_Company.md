# Chapter 272 Leizhou Sugar Company

Chang Shide was half-lying, half-reclining on the bed. After drinking a bit of hangover soup, though his head was fuzzy, he felt quite content. Just as he was about to go to sleep, Wen Xiu slipped into the room without a sound, wearing only a close-fitting undershirt, his hair untied and combed back, his face flushed like peach blossoms, his almond eyes full of amorous invitation. Chang Shide was momentarily stunned, not knowing what purpose this appearance served.

Wen Xiu curtsied like a woman, and said softly, "Wen Xiu is here to attend Your Honor to bed." Then he came forward to help undress him, his pair of soft, delicate hands lightly pressing and kneading over his body. In a coy voice, he called out: "Your Honor—"

Chang Shide remained frozen for about five seconds. Then suddenly, all the alcohol seemed to evaporate through his pores. A cold chill rushed from his heels straight to the top of his head, and goosebumps rose all over his body.

"No—" He let out a wail, quickly pushed Wen Xiu away, and tumbled off the bed in a scramble. Mama mia, what era was this where a servant sexually harassed the master? If it had been a maidservant harassing him, that would have been one thing—but this was a man. No matter how pretty Wen Xiu was, he was still a man.

This small disturbance caused a commotion. Zhou Shizhai burst through the door in an instant. Seeing the scene, the escort's face also changed dramatically. He quickly said, "Please take your time, Your Honor," and backed out with his head bowed.

"No, Old Zhou, let me explain—" Chang Shide hadn't even put on his shoes and hurried after him. Outside, Li Biao was craning his neck to peek, and several escort guards had gathered in the courtyard, holding swords and sticks.

"What are you looking at? Everyone go back!" Zhou Shizhai waved his hand impatiently, then quickly said to the disheveled Chang Shide, "Chief Chang, your appearance is rather unsightly—"

"Yes, yes, I know." He hurried back inside to put on his shoes.

By now, Wen Tong had also come out. He had been drafting a report on improving sugar production by lamplight. Hearing the commotion, he came out to see what was happening but couldn't make sense of it. All he saw was Wen Xiu, clothes in disarray, coming out of Chang Shide's room looking aggrieved. He immediately jumped to the wrong conclusion and his face darkened:

"Old Chang, I always knew you were a bit of a flirt, but I didn't expect you had this kind of preference!" Wen Tong didn't discriminate against gay people, but he had a lot of contempt for those who swung both ways just for physical pleasure.

"I did nothing of the sort!" Chang Shide was so frantic he was scratching his ears and cheeks, wishing he could die. It was clearly this she-male who had tried to harass him, yet everyone seemed to think he had been plotting against the fellow's chrysanthemum.

"Old Wen, you have to believe your revolutionary comrade! You can't possibly not believe me—we were roommates in Lingao! You know what kind of person I am!"

"Hard to say. Once people leave the collective, many ugly aspects of human nature come out."

"I've been wronged—" Chang Shide called upon heaven and earth, both swearing and explaining, before Wen Tong was finally inclined to believe that Wen Xiu had harassed him. By then, Liao Dahua had arrived. Still fuming about being wrongly blamed, Chang Shide couldn't help but take it out on Liao Dahua as well. He even cursed out Guo Yi—how had he sent over a catamite to serve them?

Liao Dahua laughed: "Master Chang need not be angry. The boys simply misunderstood. These servant boys specifically raised to attend to gentlemen—serving tea and attending to daily needs by day, and acting as bed companions by night—that's all quite normal. Yesterday, Shopkeeper Wen said not to buy maidservants and that traveling with servant boys was more convenient. They must have gotten the wrong idea. Since the Master doesn't mean that kind of thing, I'll just give them a good scolding."

"What? There's such a thing?" Chang Shide was immediately shocked, his preconceptions about ancient sexual mores shattered.

"Very common. Those sour scholars wandering the land with their books, swords, and lute cases—they all bring a young servant boy along. One, it's convenient to have someone to order around away from home; two, when they can't bear it at night, they use them to relieve tension. The great officials at court also keep some specially; those particularly intimate ones are doted on even more than concubines."

"Damn, what kind of society is this!" Chang Shide couldn't help but curse.

Liao Dahua just stood smiling apologetically. He knew Wen Xiu, that child, had been too eager to curry favor and had attempted to "offer himself at the pillow." This time, he'd really kissed up to the horse's hoof. Neither of these two seemed to be interested in the "southern wind." In his mind, he began scheming to quickly find a few maidservants.

The evening's disturbance passed. At first, Chang Shide remained suspicious, deeply afraid his heroic image would become a laughingstock. Later, he discovered that the indigenous people had no interest in gossiping about this matter at all. Even Wen Xiu came the next day as if nothing had happened to bring him his washing water. Probably, as Liao Dahua had said, this sort of thing really wasn't considered a big deal.

The next day, the two continued traveling by sedan chair, protected by the Qiwei Escort Agency personnel. Over about half a month, they successively inspected all the sugarcane estates and sugar mills under their control. They gained a preliminary understanding of the situation. The hardships of the journey, the dust and toil—these need not be detailed. They also encountered several highway robbery attempts along the way, but thanks to the Qiwei escorts, they passed through all of them without serious danger.

The conditions at the various estates and sugar mills were largely similar. Some still had a few long-term workers remaining; others were completely deserted. Wen Tong now understood Leizhou's sugar production situation: it was a typical integration of estate and mill. There were no rustic sugar mills that operated purely as processors. They were all attached to cane estates run by cane farmers or landlords with larger holdings, or cooperatively operated by cane farmers pooling resources. The rustic mills primarily processed sugarcane from their own fields, with outside contract processing as a secondary function. Equipment utilization rates were low, so without exception, they were small-scale and primitively equipped.

Sugarcane cultivation didn't follow the tenant farming system common in rural areas. Small plots of land were self-cultivated by cane farmers, with a few day laborers hired during the busy season. Larger plots were entirely managed by landlords hiring long-term workers—already showing the embryonic form of agricultural wage labor.

Therefore, once the land changed hands, all the labor force on that land vanished. This was completely different from the tenant farming system, where landlords changed but tenants remained. This created an urgent demand for replenishing the labor force.

On this day, the party returned to the estate in Xuwen. Zhang Xin had also arrived in Xuwen as the liaison from the Guangzhou Station. As the future primary distributor of Leizhou white sugar, the Guangzhou Station attached great importance to this.

At the proposal of the Guangzhou Station and with the Executive Committee's approval, Wen Tong and Chang Shide formally established the Leizhou Sugar Company in Xuwen. The capital for starting the sugar company was allocated by the Guangzhou Station. The sugarcane estate outside Xuwen town would serve as the company's headquarters. Wen Tong planned to use Xuwen as a pilot site for sugar industry improvements.

"Can it produce white sugar?" Zhang Xin was very concerned about this question and asked repeatedly.

"No problem. We can produce white sugar better than any in Guangdong." Wen Tong was extremely confident about this. "But to have a price advantage, we'll need to see if the Machinery Department can help us make equipment."

"Some Englishmen have recently arrived in Guangzhou." Zhang Xin passed on a piece of information. "They're being very cautious, currently seeking to purchase goods. Sugar is also a major item. If we can produce sugar before April, selling twenty or thirty tons shouldn't be a problem."

"That's doable. But I'll need the Guangzhou Station to give me enough manpower," Wen Tong said. "Replenishing labor locally is very difficult."

"How many people?"

"At least three hundred." In Wen Tong's plan, this batch would become the first workers for the sugarcane farms and sugar factory. Each estate needed at least twenty laborers added; those with sugar mills would need even more.

"All able-bodied laborers?"

"Women and children too. That way, the able-bodied men are tied down. Besides, farmwomen from Guangdong and Fujian are all very capable. They're strong and, as I see it, no worse than men. Oh, and find about ten people with cattle-raising experience."

"Fine. I can give you five hundred." Zhang Xin agreed immediately. Due to the ongoing migration work, Lingao's reception capacity was already strained. A single purification cycle took forty days, and Lingao's quarantine camp could only accommodate about four hundred people at a time. Many already-recruited migrants could only be settled in Guangzhou to await transport. The Guangzhou Station had for this purpose established a village in the outskirts resembling a quarantine zone, where some preliminary "purification" work was conducted. The camp now held over a thousand people. To avoid arousing the local government's suspicions, Guo Yi was already trying to send some of them away as quickly as possible.

"I'm afraid I can't handle five hundred people." Wen Tong said. "Let's start with three hundred. There's too much going on here. I was also hoping to get some cadres from Lingao."

"Cadres are hard to come by." Zhang Xin said. "The Qiwei people are very reliable. You can select some backbone members from among them to serve as military cadres." Seeing Wen Tong's surprised expression, Zhang Xin added, "Leizhou is a chaotic place. As a major sugar mill owner, you'll naturally attract the envy of various heroes eventually. Bandits go without saying, but if the local gentry get ideas, that could also be trouble. To protect your person and property, you'll need armed forces. Start by setting up a militia. Weapons will be shipped from Lingao."

"Alright." Wen Tong figured he'd just hand this task over to Chang Shide—after all, he knew how to swing that demon-head sword.

"I plan to first establish a sugarcane cooperative here in Xuwen, then expand to Haikang, Suixi, and other places."

"Keep buying up sugarcane land to expand the plantations?"

"I would like to run plantations," Wen Tong said. "Right now, the operating model here is still mainly small-scale farming. The planting and management standards are too backward."

During the half-month journey, Wen Tong had gotten a fairly clear picture of sugarcane cultivation here. Under the small-scale farming economy, cultivation of cash crops was highly arbitrary: some grew fruit cane, some grew sugar cane; as for field management, some clearly put in great effort, while others were slapdash, entirely dependent on the weather. Some people were even growing sugarcane in places that weren't suitable for it at all...

For a cash crop like sugarcane, the best operating model was naturally large-scale plantations: consolidating these small patches of land into one large sugarcane plantation. Whether using a wage-labor system or slavery, production efficiency would be far higher than the current small-scale farming.

But purchasing the cane farmers' land wasn't easy. Cane farmers rarely went bankrupt or faced business difficulties. Even paying those terrifyingly high interest rates, cultivating cane fields was still profitable. Without natural or man-made disasters, mass land annexation was nearly impossible. Unless the transmigrators manipulated sugar prices to force all these smallholders into bankruptcy and then buy them out one by one. Wen Tong didn't agree with this approach—not because he was particularly compassionate, but because he didn't think the Transmigration Collective had that capability yet.

"My idea is to set up a sugarcane cooperative." Wen Tong produced his proposal: organize all growers producing the same crop. Under their supervision, provide unified technical guidance and improved varieties, unified purchase of fertilizer, unified sugar processing, and unified sales. Lower costs, increase returns. Wen Tong estimated this proposal would attract quite a few small growers to join.

"This plan definitely won't show much result in the first year, but over time, once the benefits become apparent, farmers will naturally be willing to join. There's no other way—we're not the government and can't mandate it. We can only rely on word-of-mouth reputation to achieve our goals."

"Then you'll need to put down roots in Leizhou." Zhang Xin looked at his grand plan. "This plan won't show results for three to five years. Just persuading each household, plus the dividend distribution after harvest... you'll need quite a team to help you."

"Putting down roots is fine. I can enjoy the life of a grand landlord." Wen Tong was very interested in this enterprise. "As for management and technical personnel here, I've applied to the Education Committee for some. I'll take whatever they can allocate. If it's not enough, I plan to conduct my own training. As for persuading small farmers to join—I'll convince as many as I can. After three to five years, if all goes well, I'll be the largest sugar supplier in Leizhou. With abundant, high-quality sugar, I can then engage in predatory pricing, crash the market purchase price, and bankrupt everyone who refuses to join the cooperative. Then I'll just buy up both them and their land."

Zhang Xin nodded repeatedly. He hadn't expected Wen Tong, a technical man, to be capable of such ruthless tactics.

"Whatever you need, just ask. The Guangzhou Station will fully cooperate."

"We're just a sugar production base here. We don't have an intelligence staff allocation. But I'd very much like to know the specifics of Hai'an Street. The locals call it 'Sweet Port.' Sugar is all exported from there, and there are quite a few sugar trading houses on that street. These merchants from Chao and Shan—sooner or later, they'll be our competitors—"

"That's easy. We'll arrange for someone to go undercover there. If normal methods don't work when the time comes, we'll use abnormal ones. The Special Reconnaissance Team is itching for action."

"Haha, preferably not. But our time is limited. We can't afford to drag things out in some commercial war. Cutting through the Gordian knot is better."

The two sides agreed on a series of communication methods. Since Leizhou wasn't an official dispatch station, just a secondary outpost, there was currently no radio allocation. Communication with Lingao would primarily use carrier pigeons. Communication with Guangzhou, besides pigeons, could also utilize the Qiwei Escort Agency's routes for transmitting letters. Per the Executive Committee's instructions, unless absolutely necessary, they should avoid directly sending people across the sea to Lingao for contact—the less direct contact between the two sides, the better.

The Executive Committee also had a line on the salt merchant Liu Gang in Leizhou. He resided within Haikang County's borders. But after consideration, the Executive Committee decided the two sides should maintain separate single-line communications and avoid contact. Liu Gang was an important channel for smuggling salt to the mainland for them—he was to be carefully protected.
