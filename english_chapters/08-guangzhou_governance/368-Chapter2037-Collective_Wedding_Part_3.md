# Chapter 2037 - Collective Wedding (Part 3)

In the September of the Little Ice Age, the weather had turned cool. Although it still felt hot under the sun, the river surface was open, and bursts of cool breeze blew, refreshing everyone.

The mighty fleet sailed on the broad Pearl River against the wind of late summer and early autumn. Colorful flags and ribbons fluttered in the breeze, and fresh flowers swayed. The sound of drums and music came with the wind all the way, truly giving people a feeling of floating like immortals. The wealthy landlords watching the excitement were all in high spirits for drinking, bringing out food boxes and setting out wine and food one after another. Those wealthy households who had hired flower boats found it even more convenient; the boatmen had long prepared banquets for them to drink and make merry while admiring this rare "Australian Scene."

White Swan Pool was originally a place where wealthy and powerful families feasted and sought pleasure. Hearing that the Australians were going to hold a "Flower Boat Cruise" here, wealthy households had long booked the riverside restaurants, tea houses, and flower boats, setting up banquets, bringing concubines and beautiful maids. Accompanied by dancing girls and singing boys, they drank and made merry here early on, just waiting for the flower boats to arrive.

As long as they hadn't capsized in the tax storm, they had now gradually adapted to Australian rule. Especially the merchants in the city—although taxes had multiplied several times, deducting the "filial respect" formerly given to the "big thresholds" (officials) and incense money for "various gods" (local gangs/corrupt clerks), the total calculated was actually much less than in the past. Ever since Wen Desi raised the slogan "Founding the Nation on Industry and Commerce" several times in the newspapers, the status of merchants had risen sharply, and social pressure had plummeted. They no longer kept a low profile like in the past to avoid being targeted by high officials or street rascals and losing money. So, not to mention those listed among the twelve sponsors, even those not listed treated this as a good opportunity for their own businesses to "make a name and establish prestige."

The main venue at the Great World naturally could only feature the names of the twelve sponsors. But here by the White Swan Pool, there was no such rule. Along the riverbank, various big business names hired craftsmen and laborers one after another to erect colorful floral arches. Some also imitated the Australians, piling up flower beds. The flower farmers in the Henan area sold out their stock of flowers and trees almost overnight, making a small fortune.

At this moment, along the White Swan Pool, there were fully one or two hundred arches and flower beds of all sizes, all competing in beauty and clustered with flowers. Various auspicious characters were inlaid on them, such as "Centennial Harmony," "Phoenixes Flying Together," "Holding the Tray to the Eyebrows"... all kinds of phrases piled up with wracked brains. There were also those who knew the score and specially hired people to write slogans as large as bushel baskets, like "Long Live the Council of Elders," "Long Live the Sage Son of Heaven of Great Song," "Serve the Council of Elders and the People," and the like. Naturally, the names of each business were indispensable—after all, these flirtatious winks had to be seen by someone.

The Gao Ju family was naturally one of the twelve sponsors. He was also the president of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Council of Elders' number one "old friend." How could he not join in the fun for such a matter? Although the sponsorship amount was limited to only three hundred yuan per family, he could play freely with the flower beds and colorful arches by the White Swan Pool. He was also generous, instructing Yan Xiaomao to hire the best color-binding craftsmen and florists in the city at high prices, erecting two leading arches by the White Swan Pool.

One was in the name of the Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and the other, slightly smaller, was in the name of Gao Ju's own firm. These two arches were among the best in terms of both size and luxury. Under the two arches, a flower bed nearly two people high was piled up. On top, a skilled carpenter had made a model based on the "Holy Ship" propaganda picture in magazines, floating above a sea of flowers; the background was a red sun tied with red *tongcao* flowers.

Most gentry and wealthy households had suffered heavy losses in the tax investigation. Fearing that doing or saying too much in these eventful times would violate Australian taboos, most avoided coming. However, the young children of various families had always been fond of fun and didn't take family worries and situations seriously. They still called friends to come here to see the "Australian Scene," shouting their satisfaction one by one—such magnificent wonders were rarely seen even by well-traveled high officials. Amidst sighs of admiration, they all faintly felt that the Australians were "crazy"—to actually support a few low-class prostitutes going straight at such cost; was this having nowhere to spend money, or was there something wrong with their brains?

In a private room of a restaurant, several figures looking like rich young masters were overlooking the fleet sailing in the river amidst drums and music, talking as they watched.

"Such extravagance and waste—I wonder what the Australians rely on to make money?"

"What do they rely on? They rely on everyone's family property and fields," the speaker said sourly.

"That's where you don't know. This really didn't cost the Australians much money—it's all the various big households in this city spending money to join the fun."

"Isn't it just Gao Ju's twelve families?"

"More than that," the speaker smiled faintly. "If you go to the Temple of the Five Immortals right now, a *Luo Tian Da Jiao* (Grand Offering Ritual) is being held. There's almost no place left to insert the tablets for 'joyous contributions.' How many big households in the city are rushing to send money to Daoist Cui—if Daoist Cui refuses to accept, the heads of households are almost anxious to tears—look, isn't that a wonder of the world?"

"This Australian art of accumulation is truly invincible under heaven. To actually come up with such a method!" A burst of laughter suddenly came from the private room.

The people on the fleet naturally didn't know what the people on shore were discussing. The entire fleet sailed slowly along the riverbank. The grooms and brides bathed in the cool river breeze; whatever their mood at the beginning, at this moment their hearts opened up. Such a life experience was truly something one couldn't even dream of! Several women couldn't help weeping with joy, washing away the makeup on their faces, and had to touch up temporarily.

Du Yibin was currently on a painted pleasure boat in the fleet. Originally, he didn't need to participate in this cruise—most Elders attending the wedding were waiting at the Great World—but he couldn't rest assured about his "precious bump": Song Yingsheng.

Since organizing the matchmaking event, Song Yingsheng's attitude had softened quite a bit, but he refused to loosen his mouth on key issues. Helpless, Du Yibin had to seize every opportunity to let him "experience the new life." So Song Yingsheng was again dragged by Du Yibin to participate in this collective wedding together—not only that, he specifically booked a seat for Song Yingsheng in the fleet and accompanied him personally.

"I wasn't even this enthusiastic chasing my girlfriend back then," Du Yibin couldn't help complaining.

However, Song Yingsheng didn't appreciate his kindness, claiming he was "slightly indisposed" and couldn't go out, then making excuses that he was "seasick." Only after all were exposed by Du Yibin did he explicitly state he didn't want to appear at such a large event.

However, Du Yibin said you also contributed to this collective—the characters for "Guangzhou City's First Matchmaking Assembly" were written by you. These characters were beautifully written; he planned to write a special article in the *Yangcheng Evening News* collective wedding special edition detailing Song Yingsheng's inscription, adding appreciation.

Song Yingsheng wanted to cry but had no tears—truly, one slip causes a thousand ages of regret. He wrote a few characters, and now the Hair thieve held this handle to coerce him. Thus, he came to participate in this "grand ceremony unprecedented in history" with "great difficulty."

At this moment, he sat upright in the "first-class seat" of the painted pleasure boat. This was the second-floor pavilion of the boat, open on all sides with an excellent view. The seat was not only comfortable but also accompanied by tea and snacks. Ordinary large households, if their "joyous contribution" amount wasn't high enough, couldn't even sit in this position. Song Yingsheng dressed shabbily but was accompanied by an Elder to take a seat in this first-class section. From the beginning, he attracted the attention and discussion of the large households on the boat. When Song Yingsheng saw those fellow passengers from wealthy households looking at him with various expressions, he immediately understood Du Yibin's intention. This was making it so that even jumping into the Yellow River wouldn't wash him clean! If anyone recognized him, wouldn't the charge of "submitting to the Hair" be firmly established!

Seeing him sitting on pins and needles, Du Yibin knew what he was thinking. He didn't want to provoke him too much, so he comforted: "Mr. Song need not worry too much. These large households are mostly locals and don't know you, Sir..."

Song Yingsheng snorted very proudly, indicating he didn't accept Du Yibin's nonsense. Then he sat upright without saying a word.

Although silent, the beautiful scenery along the way was visible. The scenery and layout along the way were certainly grand and magnificent, too beautiful to absorb, but in Song Yingsheng's mind, this was truly too ostentatious and wasteful! If the matchmaking event was suspected of "making a mountain out of a molehill," then this collective wedding was simply "making a giant mountain out of a molehill" and "doing it extravagantly." Even with Du Yibin's "human relations" theory to hold the line, he really couldn't bear it anymore.

"Too luxurious, too luxurious!" Song Yingsheng shook his head involuntarily. "This was originally a beautiful thing, why make it so ostentatious! These are all the fat and marrow of the people! Although Guangzhou is now stable, the whole of Guangdong is still in endless strife, and the people are still in deep water and scorching fire—even in this Guangzhou city, I fear there are many poor people who do not have enough to eat and have no food for the next day. Why spend this money on such vain appearances?"

Du Yibin wasn't angry hearing his words. In his view, this old man's simple view of right and wrong fit his sense of morality very well. This compassion for the poor came from the heart, not affectation. The key was that his ability to care about Guangzhou and Guangdong affairs showed he still had considerable identification with the Council of Elders' regime.

"Mr. Song, don't worry. This money was all donated by the merchant households in the city, not from tax money and grain..." he comforted.

"This is also inappropriate," Song Yingsheng shook his head. "Although not from tax money, isn't it also exploited from the peck-and-hamper commoners in the end? Those merchant households neither farm nor manufacture; they profit from circulating goods—isn't what they earn the people's money! They donate here, and turn around to exploit it from the people over there..."

Du Yibin thought: isn't this Song Yingsheng's thinking a bit too outdated? Not a bit of his third brother's "advanced nature." It seemed convincing this old man to be used by us would still take a lot of effort...

He thought for a moment and said: "Sir's words are incorrect. Merchants travel in all directions, circulating goods and exchanging what one has for what one lacks; this is a good thing. Taking profit from it is also only natural."
