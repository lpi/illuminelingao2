# Chapter 1949 - First Date

During this period, although losing contact with the organization once made her panic-stricken all day, over time, it opened a door named "freedom" in her heart, allowing her to experience the joy of having no pressure and tasks. This didn't mean the work was easy; in fact, the work was very tiring. Feng Nuo used her like an adult male worker. Rather, it was a change in mood: she began to have the opportunity to think about what to do after work tomorrow, what new products the coop would sell next month, whether she could ask Chief Feng to formally transfer her from the Tiandihui next year when new graduates arrived... Also, what to buy when wages were paid?

"Hmm, I'll just buy a pair of shoes for that fool Qian Yuzhi, and treat him to a meal at East Gate Market. Consider it a little compensation for ordering him around during this time, and also to thank him for introducing me here."

Qian Yuzhi didn't quite understand why they suddenly had to go to East Gate Market to eat together today, although as long as Li Jianai came to work, they would generally eat together and then go home together.

According to Qian Yuzhi's little life experience in the "old society," if a young woman was willing to do this, she basically planned to marry him. But in the "new society," this just meant the other party had some good feelings for you. Wanting to marry, that was out of the question—not to mention a "Senate disciple" from the College of Arts and Sciences like Li Jianai, even an ordinary young woman graduated from junior primary school working as a worker or clerk in farms, factories, or agencies was not something a newly entered factory apprentice like Qian Yuzhi could reach. At least he had to wait until he was assessed to a certain level and his wages reached a certain degree before he would be considered by the other party.

However, going to East Gate Market for a meal this time was a bit solemn. He secretly speculated on what the other party was thinking, and who would "treat" this meal—his wages were a bit low, and he didn't dare to spend the rent paid by Li Jianai casually. His sister's marriage and his own wife-seeking in the future both required spending.

However, facing the girl's invitation with sparkling eyes, he involuntarily agreed. Although he had become accustomed to Li Jianai's command these days, he still vaguely felt this was different, and his heart beat faster.

Li Jianai seemed to be in a very good mood. She had heard classmates from the College of Arts and Sciences say that there was a shop specially for drinking at East Gate Market and had always been very curious. Today was just right to go see it with Qian Yuzhi.

The shop wasn't big, with dim lighting. A long counter where the shopkeeper poured wine and cooked dishes inside. The outer edge of the counter was a long tabletop with several round stools. Against the wall were small tables with high backrests, a bit like seats on the small train—Li Jianai said this was called a "booth." When fully occupied, probably only twenty-some people could sit.

This was a husband-and-wife shop. The one selling wine at the stove was the proprietress, said to be a former waitress at Nanhai Coffee House. The man worked at East Gate Restaurant. The couple had both been influenced by "Australian dining." After getting married, they both resigned and opened this roadside small shop selling both food and wine.

Although the shop was small, the decoration and utensils were completely "Australian style." Every item looked fresh, yet good-looking and easy to use, and the arrangement was very comfortable. In the evening when lanterns were first lit, the light of gas lamps inside shone through the bamboo curtains. Not to mention eating and drinking, just going in and sitting down felt comfortable.

It sold "Australian style" wine and food, not too expensive. Customers were mainly naturalized citizens working in Senate enterprises and agencies. Especially young people without family burdens; coming here on the way off work to eat a set meal and drink a glass of kvass or beverage became a rare relaxation after a tired day.

It wasn't too late yet, and the shop was very deserted. The two found a round table in a corner and sat down, ordering two set meals and two bottles of kvass. They were used to eating together in the canteen. Now eating while chatting casually about work and life, Qian Yuzhi felt that chatting in this environment was really nice. He guessed ninety-nine percent it was that Australian tone coming from the Chiefs again.

The set meal portion was large, but for people like them who labored all day, it wasn't worth mentioning. Qian Yuzhi ordered a large fried fish cake set. Two large golden fried fish cakes were placed on shredded vegetables—this kind of vegetable didn't exist in Hainan in the past. It was brought by the Chiefs and initially planted in the Nanhai Demonstration Farm. Everyone called it "Kun Cabbage," but Australians called it cabbage.

A layer of thick sauce was poured over the fish steak, carrying a stimulating spicy aroma that whetted the appetite. It came with a large bowl of white rice and oyster mushroom vegetable soup.

Li Jianai came from the College of Arts and Sciences. Although her labor volume wasn't small, she knew the importance of "healthy diet" and "keeping fit," so she ate lighter: vegetable stir-fried shrimp meat over rice with seafood clear soup.

These dishes were all brought by the Australians. If the Chiefs hadn't come to Lingao and conquered this small piece of the world here, he, Qian Yuzhi, would never have gathered such a delicious fish steak in the Ming Dynasty in his lifetime—let alone enjoying delicious food, being able to eat a meal of fine grain a few years ago would have been a great joy for him.

This is all fate. Qian Yuzhi was in a trance for a moment. Everything around him seemed to become incredibly strange, as if it were a dream.

"What's wrong? Spaced out?"

Li Jianai interrupted his trance.

"Nothing, just feel this place is really nice." He said, picking up shredded cabbage to wipe, wiping off the sauce and fish cake crumbs sticking to the plate, and eating it in big mouthfuls with rice.

"You really have a good appetite." Li Jianai said with an appreciative expression, "This is an Australian-style restaurant—the place I chose isn't bad..."

Suddenly she saw a figure flash at the door, seeming to glance inside, then quickly left.

Professionalism made her immediately realize that the figure just now was someone she knew.

Who was it?

"Not bad, not bad." Qian Yuzhi didn't know her discovery and nodded. Although admitting this place was "not bad," he couldn't figure out why the girl suddenly wanted to invite him here for a meal.

Could it be she really is interested in me? Qian Yuzhi started letting his imagination run wild.

"Of course the place I chose won't be bad, let you broaden your horizons..." Li Jianai answered perfunctorily. She already knew in her heart: the one who flashed past just now was Feng Shan.

She came to East Gate Market too? Li Jianai was slightly strange. Because Feng Shan's life was basically two-point-one-line, and although nominally a Living Secretary, she actually rarely did Living Secretary work. More like Chief Feng's student.

But her curiosity stopped there. After all, East Gate Market wasn't a secret place. Her attention returned to Qian Yuzhi.

Kvass contained a slight amount of alcohol. One bottle down, the two naturally talked more. From initial politeness, they gradually started talking about their respective life experiences, and unknowingly started drinking the second and third bottles.

Qian Yuzhi chattered about his childhood, the encouragement of the Chief who came to comfort the family after his father sacrificed, and bragged with slight pride about how beautiful his sister was and how excellent her grades were...

Speaking of his sister, he was silent for a while before continuing that he must pass the Class A diploma and then the technician exam, but he was too stupid and always made the master angry. Fortunately, he could serve the Chief now... and why he didn't live in the dormitory, how much money he could save monthly by living at home, how much money he could collect from renting the house, how much he earned and spent monthly... He had to prepare a large sum of betrothal gifts to marry a wife, and also spend money on his sister's marriage; later when having children, they would go to Fangcaodi National School—if they couldn't enter the selection group and get a scholarship, he would have to raise tuition for further studies...

Li Jianai saw him unconsciously steal a glance at her when saying "marry a wife," and felt it funny. However, these drunken ravings like "idiots talking about dreams" were full of longing and hope, which moved her somewhat.

She remembered what the Chief who trained them said when she attended the Political Security Bureau training class: "You will be very lonely, you will make sacrifices, but your task is extraordinary. It is to protect the safety and property of the Senate and the people, to protect the future and hope of the Senate and the people."

This somewhat clumsy big boy turned out to be the object of her protection too.

Li Jianai suddenly felt very amused, but her eyes felt sour.

This feeling is really strange, she thought, must have drunk too much kvass.

The two stayed in the small shop until very late, drinking a table full of empty kvass bottles, and finally forgot about buying shoes for Qian Yuzhi.

That night Qian Yuzhi had a very strange dream. He dreamed that he ate many, many snacks called "small cakes" sold in that shop. Soft, fragrant, sweet, with a cherry on top, also sweet and sour. He ate one after another, as if he could never be full... Suddenly, a large amount of kvass seemed to leak from the ceiling, pouring on his head.

He woke up and saw Li Jianai standing before the bed with a face like ice holding a cup, and his face was all water.

"Get up and go to work! Look what time it is!" She said this sentence, then turned and walked out of the room.

Qian Yuzhi scratched his head and sat up. His head still hurt. He seemed to have dreamed of something delicious just now, but the wonderful taste he repeatedly experienced in the dream faded rapidly with the clarity of his mind, becoming more blurred the more he recalled, until he couldn't remember it anymore.

Next were the unchanging days. Qian Yuzhi still did various miscellaneous chores, sometimes a transporter, sometimes a laborer, sometimes a mechanic, sometimes a painter. Slowly he exercised some skills. Jia Ben occasionally nodded seeing his work. Feng Nuo frequently met and discussed with Senators from the Ministry of Science and Technology, electrical department, and mechanical department, compiling some materials when free; Feng Shan's study and work became busy again, only able to come help at night; Li Jianai still spent two or three days a week doing Tiandihui work, and came to work part-time for the rest of the time.
