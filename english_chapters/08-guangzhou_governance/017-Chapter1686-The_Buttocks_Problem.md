# Chapter 1686 - The Buttocks Problem

"You farm over two hundred mu of land and are a grain household, yet you can't even gather enough betrothal gifts at once to get a wife?" Yun Suji found it incredible.

"Grain households don't have surplus grain either." Bai Putin smiled, his smile mixed with various flavors. "The betrothal gifts here are too expensive. One woman is worth five or six oxen, tsk tsk..."

"Betrothal gifts are that expensive?!" Yun Suji only knew that current betrothal gifts were very high, but didn't expect them to be this high. Tethering a large draft animal often required a farmer to save up for one or two years of frugal eating. If marrying a wife cost five or six oxen, it would essentially eliminate the possibility of marriage for most people.

He knew that in the past, betrothal gifts in Lingao had always been high due to more men than women. The Engine Plan, besides importing labor, actually also considered balancing the gender ratio.

From the statistical data from the civil administration, the gender ratio in Hainan had indeed improved. Although there were still more men than women, at least it wasn't so drastically imbalanced anymore. But looking at the grassroots level, the betrothal gift phenomenon had instead intensified. He noticed that the improved living conditions brought by the recovery of production had not only failed to suppress the betrothal gift market but had continued to push it up. Yun Suji knew that in the past, marrying a wife was just about satisfying "having or not having" one; now that life was stable and there was land, marrying a wife also meant an additional laborer for the family, greatly benefiting household production. For the family marrying off a daughter, the loss was twofold. No wonder betrothal gift prices were so high.

"Chief, don't laugh at me, but now everyone says it's useless to only raise sons; you have to have a daughter." A group head nearby interjected with an apologetic smile. "Otherwise, you can't even afford to marry a wife!"

"What's there to laugh at? Boys and girls are the same." Yun Suji said, "If you only want sons, where do the wives come from? You're all counting on other families to give birth and raise them for you? Last time the county tried a case of drowning a female infant, the man still stuck out his neck saying daughters were useless, money-losing goods, better drowned and done with. I said daughters are money-losing goods, where did you come from? Isn't your mother, your grandmother a money-losing good? How come they weren't drowned but gave birth to such a piece of goods as you? Only then did he have nothing to say."

The group heads all chuckled dryly a few times.

Yun Suji then asked Fan Twelve, "How many bachelors are there in your village?"

This question stumped Fan Twelve. The numerous ledgers and statistical tables issued by the county were really too many; just looking at them was annoying. He had Han Daoguo fill them in randomly and submit them to cope with the task. But even so, there didn't seem to be a specific ledger for counting bachelors.

He thought for a long time, went through all the unmarried men in the village in his mind, and vaguely said: "There are many unmarried men, and some have dead wives..."

Yun Suji also felt his question wasn't rigorous enough and rephrased: "Just talking about the full laborers in your village, how many don't have wives?"

"That's quite a few. Including those whose wives died, close to a hundred."

"So more than half the people don't have wives." Yun Suji thought this number was not small. Men without wives was a social problem! Moreover, the countryside was different from cities. In towns, they attracted prostitution through issuing yellow tickets to solve the sexual needs of male workers, which could solve certain problems. But in the countryside, marrying a wife wasn't just about solving sexual needs; there was also the demand for organizing household labor.

Yun Suji then asked Bai Putin how production was going and what difficulties and opinions he had.

Seeing the Chief was very polite and approachable, Bai Putin became much bolder. He hesitated for a moment and said: "Chief, I just have something I don't understand about the Senate's public grain. Please don't take offense when I say it..."

"Oh? Go ahead and speak." Yun Suji was immediately interested. Currently in the new Hainan area, after completing the re-measurement of fields, the old collection model had been completely abolished and replaced with a progressive tax. This new tax system was very popular among the masses because the burden was clear.

"This lowly one, I... I..." Bai Putin suddenly felt he had said the wrong thing. Since ancient times, the imperial grain and national taxes were set by the emperor and the court. For a small commoner like himself to say "don't understand" could easily lead to an accusation of "recklessly commenting on state affairs" which wouldn't do!

Yun Suji said: "Come on, since you have an opinion, just say it. I definitely won't blame you."

Bai Putin mustered his courage and said: "This... Chief... isn't it a bit inappropriate that the more land you have, the higher the tax rate?"

Yun Suji asked: "How is it inappropriate?"

Bai Putin swallowed his saliva and said: "Chief, actually I want to clear more land. Speaking of farming five or six hundred mu is no problem. I also want to take out a loan to buy a big machine like the Tiandihui's tractor team, and tether a few more oxen to pull it. Farming is fast, there's more fertilizer accumulated, and it doesn't consume manpower. Chief Wan from Tiandihui also said clearing more land would bring more support policies. But the more land you farm, the heavier the tax. I calculated that farming more wouldn't be worth it..."

When he said this, several group heads resonated:

"This progressive system impoverishes hardworking people and just benefits lazy people!"

"There are families with little land and few people who don't really manage after planting rice. Anyway, harvesting rice doesn't require paying much tax. Enough for the family to eat is fine. We dig mud, clean pens, and cut grass everywhere to accumulate fertilizer. We work ourselves to death farming well, but have to pay several times the tax!"

"Ask them to do a few more work days, and they act like they're suffering an injustice. Not doing corvée labor, they just sleep at home!"

Fan Twelve became anxious upon hearing this. The corvée labor issue was originally something to be covered up, but unexpectedly this brainless group head had directly let it slip out.

Fortunately, Chief Yun didn't pursue it. He knew in his heart that there was something fishy about the labor distribution here. He asked several other group heads about their production and living conditions and found that most group heads were families with more land, stronger labor, and better production situations. Their bottoms sat in a different place from ordinary villagers.

When these people arrived in Hainan, they were all proletarians, relying on the Senate's relief for food and clothing. In just over two years, wealth differentiation had already appeared. Small farmer consciousness, landlord thinking had all emerged—Yun Suji secretly sighed. It seemed the State Council's proposal to "vigorously develop intensive farms" was quite necessary.

He asked some other questions and felt it was about enough, then said: "Let's go see the difficult households in your village."

Fan Twelve quickly agreed. Yun Suji came out and saw the young man who had beaten Old Meng earlier hiding behind. He had already learned from the cadre roster that this was the village militia captain and security committee member Liu Yuanhu. He called out: "Liu Yuanhu! What are you hiding from? I'm not a tiger. Besides, even if I were a tiger, I wouldn't eat you, another tiger."

Liu Yuanhu was so embarrassed his face turned completely red. He had to come back and mumble: "I made the Chief laugh."

Yun Suji looked Liu Yuanhu up and down. Seeing he was in his early twenties, with broad shoulders and dark skin, he was obviously a strong farm hand at a glance. Very youthful and energetic, unlike the old fox Fan Twelve. With good cultivation, he would make a decent cadre.

Even for Fan Twelve and Han Daoguo, he didn't feel they were that hopeless. Fan Twelve, as a village cadre, was quite capable, and on the Senate's major policies, he could be described as firmly standing and executing forcefully. Although Han Daoguo inevitably played tricks, being able to organize all these ledgers and data so orderly was already impressive.

"I see you're a capable person, but your methods are too crude. You still need to use your brain more." Yun Suji pointed to his own head. "You can't just rely on impulsiveness."

"Yes, Chief."

"Lead the way."

Seeing the Chief hadn't reprimanded him for his "impudent offense," Liu Yuanhu felt mostly relieved. What he said later made him a bit apprehensive, but there was no time to ponder now. He quickly led the way ahead.

They first came to a household on the west side of the village. Fan Twelve introduced that this household was an elderly couple with a small grandson. Originally there was also a son, but not long after settling down, he injured his foot while working in the fields, and soon he suddenly died.

Yun Suji thought this must have been tetanus, but the only place in Qiongshan that could inject serum was the Qiongshan County Health Station, let alone the fact that the vast majority of people didn't even know about tetanus.

"...His family's land has no one to farm it: the old man has asthma, his grandson is small and needs to be looked after by his wife. They can only make do with growing some vegetables and minor grains." Fan Twelve introduced.

"Then what do they live on?"

"The land is given to others to farm on their behalf. The substitute farmer takes thirty percent, the rest goes to their family."

"What about the public grain?"

Yun Suji's sudden question disrupted the speech Fan Twelve had prepared. He hadn't expected the Chief would ask this at all. Without time to think, he blurted out: "The public grain is also paid by the substitute farmer..."

"I suppose the substitute farmer also does corvée labor on their behalf?" Yun Suji smiled. "What a living Lei Feng."

Fan Twelve didn't know who "Lei Feng" was, but from the Chief's tone and smile, he knew the Chief didn't believe it at all, just hadn't exposed it to his face.

Yun Suji looked at this elderly couple wearing obviously just-taken-out new clothes, looking at him with fearful faces, and couldn't help feeling uncomfortable. Looking at the child again, only five or six years old, not quite sallow and emaciated, but with a very dull expression, completely lacking the liveliness of peers. Looking at this cold and cheerless house, apart from some basic furniture distributed when they moved in, there was almost no furniture or daily necessities. Yet the room was excessively tidy—like the clothes they wore, all just freshly prepared. He didn't even bother looking at the pancake stack or grain cabinet anymore; needless to say, they were all full.

Yun Suji casually asked some questions like whether there was enough grain to eat and how life was. The old man also vaguely said: "Life is okay," "The village looks after us."

"Let's go outside." Yun Suji said.

Once outside, Yun Suji said: "Village Head Fan, you didn't tell the truth."

Fan Twelve's heart jumped. He originally wanted to deny it, but thinking of the scene at the public trial in the county last year, he quickly said: "I deserve to die! I deserve to die! I confess!"

"We're not a Blue Sky Grand Master on a private investigation. Just tell me, how much grain does the substitute farmer actually give his family?"

Fan Twelve knew he couldn't hide it anymore and had to say: "The agreement is regardless of good or bad harvest, 800 catties of unpolished rice per year. Public grain and corvée labor are all borne by the substitute farmer."
