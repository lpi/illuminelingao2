# Chapter 1988 - Stamp Tax Case

Or say Group Enterprise? Associated Enterprise? Zeng Juan tried hard to recall Australian old things mentioned accidentally when Directors Zhang and Wang trained them. He vaguely understood this Group Enterprise seemed to be head shop and branch shop, but what was that Associated Enterprise. Zeng Juan was a scholar; even having defected to Australians, he still carried that scholar habit in his bones. But letting him flip through several Australian tax system books in the Finance and Tax Bureau library until rotten, he didn't see a few words mentioning these. Truly stupid! Zeng Juan cursed himself. Previously he thought the idea of separating two shops for Zhang Yu was very Australian style; didn't expect to fall into the pit he dug himself so quickly.

"Admit defeat." Zeng Juan spread his hands. "Ah Yu, remember to quickly pay supplement tax according to normal selling price. This collection period just ended; shouldn't have much late fee and fine... Right!" Zeng Juan suddenly remembered the Finance and Tax Bureau clarified in collection and management norms that trading behavior implemented cash basis. "Did you supply the goods?!"

"Not yet. Orders aren't so easy to schedule. Goods ordered by previous old customers can only be finished dispatching by end of this month." Zhang Yu was still immersed in the blow of "supplementing tax," listless.

"Good, good, hahaha, Ah Yu, don't fret." Hearing goods would only be shipped next month, Zeng Juan clapped and laughed involuntarily. "Let me tell you, remember not to ship—find reasons to stall customers first. Absolutely, absolutely don't ship! Chiefs' rule is income counts only when transaction happens and money collected. As long as you don't supply goods, it counts as no transaction. Then naturally they won't re-verify income and calculate tax for you."

"Is this true?" Zhang Yu's face revealed an expression of "there is such a clever operation."

"True. In my view, your side actually has no big problem. Problems are all on Master Luo's side." Seeing he could clear his good brother's responsibility completely, Zeng Juan's mood improved too. "I'll write a report to the division tomorrow. There are still ten days till month end; it's enough anyway. When the time comes, you just actively cooperate with their investigation. Also might let you supplement part of Stamp Tax."

"No problem." Zhang Yu hurriedly patted his chest. However, dragging shipment was not a small loss to him, especially damage to credibility—this could only given some discount compensation to customers afterwards.

"By the way, you also have to think how to void these supply contracts of the old shop."

"Hehe," Zhang Yu relaxed a lot since no longer worrying about angering the Senate, shaking the cup in hand. "This is no problem. You Finance and Tax Bureau investigated Noble Gathering; they now only fear getting involved and implicated. Still dare to be so insensible to climb connections with Luo Zhixiang?"

Next day, Zeng Juan arrived at Finance and Tax Bureau early with dark circles to sign in, printed a data access letter, and went straight to Guangzhou Municipal Government. Zeng Juan was originally a careful person; since entering Finance and Tax Bureau dealing with numbers daily, he became increasingly cautious. Although what he inquired at Zhang Yu's place last night should be nine out of ten correct, he felt better to go to Municipal Government to access Noble Gathering's registered materials during Guangzhou's first asset clearing (i.e. activity of exchanging new deeds citywide after Guangzhou Liberation) and land deed archive copies to confirm.

Regarding this household investigation report, Zeng Juan was pondering how to write since coming out of Zhang Yu's house last night, almost sleepless all night. Even drafted a few times.

Matter was clear, but the reason needed careful consideration. Choosing well, Zhang Yu unharmed; choosing badly, eating melon fall [implicated] together not to mention, losing the Special Supplier hat because of this would be troublesome.

Not only to maximize clearing dead party's responsibility, throwing the pot completely clean, but also stand firm, speak loud. Zeng Juan racked his brains recalling all tax knowledge he learned, flipping through "study materials" issued to them again and again.

How to characterize Noble Gathering's flat-price land transfer contract? First, Yin-Yang Contract was definitely no-go. Subtext of this contract was both buyer and seller knew and negotiated consistently, which would mix Zhang Yu in. This was a major issue of right and wrong; must help Zhang Yu clear clean.

Standing from Zhang Yu's angle, he believed signing two contracts was normal trading, just one of them was supplying goods at cost price to offset payment. Moreover, Zhang Yu actively declared stamps timely. It could be considered that subjectively he had no intention to deceive the Senate, only led to technical problems in contracts due to not understanding Senate laws.

As for Noble Gathering, to clear Zhang Yu, the black pot must be carried by it. Furthermore, contract drafts were all handled by Advisor Liao; subjective intent couldn't run away.

Calculating this way, since the tip he got from Director Nan was only Noble Gathering's abnormal declaration, and the team entry investigation also checked only land trading contract, better to beat them at their own game. In report, absolutely not mention Zhang Family Old Shop's contract matter. Discussion on fact, only say finding Luo Zhixiang's Noble Gathering sold land at obviously lower than fair market price, suspected of tax evasion. As for the second contract that follow-up inspection would drag out, Zeng Juan also thought of a retreat for Zhang Yu, total two paths. One is letting Zhang Yu sign an entrusted supply agreement with the old shop in the city immediately in the name of Great World store. Agreement content basically copies old shop's contract with various shops, need not be specially formal, but must note supply is at market price. Besides, add a clause stating this agreement is established to repay Great World store's land trading profit. Two is adding a specific accrued tax subject in old shop's accounts, noting the Circulation Tax payable calculated at market price for the first batch of goods needed. Of course these are to show Zhang Yu tax according to law without any intention to deceive the Senate. Anyway, real transaction will definitely terminate after Finance and Tax Bureau starts investigation, so Zhang Yu himself won't have any substantive loss.

In Great Ming, shop is home and home is shop. Even registered separately, father paying money for son is perfectly justified. Thinking Finance and Tax Bureau leaders even knowing, as long as tax doesn't leak, at most criticize a few sentences, then not to repeat. This practice seems called General Contract Subcontract in Australian Song? Whatever, Zeng Juan rubbed dark circles. As long as Zhang Yu can pass smoothly this time, it counts as worthy of his mental and physical effort these two days.

Zeng Juan had confidence as long as the report mainly stated Noble Gathering's land trading price problem, the next step Finance and Tax Bureau's most likely choice would be re-verifying land trading price, requiring both parties to re-establish contract and supplement tax, simultaneously abolishing old shop contract. Zhang Yu was the passive party, and "accrued" tax in accounts according to old shop contract. Emotionally and reasonably shouldn't face punishment.

He quickly found relevant archives in Municipal Government—no difference from what Zhang Yu provided. Thus Zeng Juan was basically assured. He returned to office, immediately started writing report, completing it before getting off work in afternoon. Specifically marked the report as Urgent-Warning, signed by all his team members, and submitted to Management Division. Things following were not for him to worry.

A week later, just starting work, Zeng Juan was notified to attend meeting in second floor small conference room at 9 AM, and asked to prepare Noble Gathering materials in advance. Hearing leaders wanted to "talk" with him about Luo family matter, Zeng Juan broke into cold sweat. Except reading Noble Gathering materials and his own entry investigation report repeatedly, he basically did nothing more than an hour before meeting. Water drank full three big cups, running to toilet non-stop, attracting colleagues' sideways glances.

Finally enduring till 8:50, Zeng Juan went upstairs ahead of time to conference room, took several deep breaths learned from Australian books to calm mood, then knocked trembling.

"Come in!" It was Director Ai's voice. This matter probably isn't small! Otherwise why would Director personally find me to talk. Zeng Juan's heart tightened instantly.

Although he racked brains, flipped through various regulations, documents, elaborately wrote that "seamless" report for him, he knew clearly: rules were set by Australians. Several Senator Chiefs, according to past saying, were all "veteran officials of pen and sword." Their familiarity and understanding of this set didn't know how many times higher than him. If they dragged out some big loophole, neither he nor Zhang Yu would have good end.

Pushing door in, not many people in conference room. Only Director Ai, Director Wang, and Inspection Division's Li Fulai, and... Huang Ping, Yao Yulan? Zeng Juan didn't see the trick. Called Report, then sat in a seat near door under Wang Qiyi's signal.

"Okay, everyone arrived. We cut the crap." Ai Zhixin straight to the point. "Today this small meeting has nothing else, just about the abnormal Stamp Tax declaration of Noble Gathering reported by Team Leader Zeng last week. Below Inspection Division Chief Li Fulai introduces case situation."

Li Fulai distributed files at hand to everyone in conference room, then started stating investigation results of these four days. Expecting Zeng Juan, this Noble Gathering wasn't a simple shop trading north-south goods. It had few assets under name but very complex shares, basically involved with big households in city, especially Lin Zunxiu family.

"Here explain: This Lin Zunxiu is on Political Security Bureau's 'Guangzhou City Key Observation List.' Also several reactionary gentry we knocked out in Witchcraft Case originally also have reflections in this firm's transaction flow. Although not shareholders, obviously have connections."

He continued saying Noble Gathering's accounts were extremely chaotic. Not only didn't establish formal Australian bookkeeping, even traditional Four Pillars Balancing accounts were vague. Besides large amounts of receivables on account, many transactions violated common logic. Although currently no solid evidence, according to Chiefs' inference should exist large amount of IOU current accounts and off-book accounts even oral accounts. According to Director Wang's words, this is a "White Glove" shop. Tax evaded through it far exceeds its total capital.

Li Fulai spoke slowly, not rushing. Yet Zeng Juan became nervous immediately. Division Chief's words were actually characterizing. This opening was obviously the rhythm of handling a big case!
