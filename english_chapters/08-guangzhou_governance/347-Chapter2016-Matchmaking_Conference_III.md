# Chapter 2016 - Matchmaking Conference (III)

The Council of Elders often complained about the Ming Dynasty's "low efficiency" and "waste of resources," but now it was a Ming official's turn to use these terms to criticize them. Du Yibin couldn't help but find it slightly absurd.

Of course, Du Yibin wasn't surprised. Although Song Yingsheng was considered a rare conscientious and responsible official at the end of the Ming Dynasty, he was still an old-style scholar. Despite coming from a "farming-reading" background, his mentality was essentially that of "ruling people," viewing commoners merely as "laborers" without independent thinking ability.

This arrogance of the "mental laborers" is common even in the 21st century. However, in the 21st century, productivity is highly developed and education widespread, enabling many "manual laborers" to consider problems using the "mental laborers'" logic, constructing a new chain of contempt.

In the 17th century, however, "farming-reading families" like Song Yingsheng's—families with examination degrees and official service histories—viewed ordinary commoners as merely ignorant and stubborn people. The Song brothers were somewhat "benevolent," but in the eyes of "corrupt officials" or "cruel clerks," ordinary commoners were truly less than ants.

Though they knew the saying "water can carry the boat but can also overturn it," in reality they operated with the mindset of "King Yu taming the flood." In other words, they didn't care how the water felt, only how much benefit it could bring and how to avoid floods.

Despite traveling with him for many days, how could such deep-rooted old thinking be easily uprooted? If not for the fact that the Song brothers were rare practical talents in the 17th century with reliable character and integrity, he wouldn't bother spending so much effort on him. Du Yibin coughed, stopping Lu Cheng and the others with a look, telling them not to get agitated. He said pleasantly:

"Mr. Song, your words are inappropriate. Since ancient times, relationships between men and women have been major affairs. How can you call it making a mountain out of a molehill?"

This sentence acted as a shield, negating his "trivial matter" claim. After all, continuing the family line is the greatest ethical concept in the Chinese mind.

Sure enough, Song Yingsheng fell silent. Du Yibin continued:

"Our matchmaking conferences have been held many times in Hainan. Whether in terms of participants, venue provided, or scale, they were much larger than this one in Guangzhou. If not for the fact that Guangzhou was liberated not long ago and many matters needed priority handling, Guangzhou City's first matchmaking conference wouldn't be this simple and hasty."

Du Yibin wasn't boasting. In terms of liveliness and grandeur, let alone a "temporary capital" like Lingao, even Gaoxiong was far better than Guangzhou. It was purely due to "financial difficulties" that the matchmaking event he organized was this shabby.

"Marriage is a major event and joyous occasion in life. Even in the Ming Dynasty, it's one of the two great triumphs in life: the day of passing the imperial exams and the wedding night. Since it's a major and joyous event for naturalized citizens, as their superiors, helping men and women choose their partners, we naturally wouldn't just casually assign an official matchmaker and clerk to muddle through."

"People have their own joys and sorrows, their temperaments differ. The commoners under the Council of Elders come from all corners of the land, with different languages and customs. Sending a matchmaker and clerk to pair them by name list—pardon my vulgarity—how is that different from breeding livestock? The ancients also said: harmony between husband and wife is a beautiful thing. Since they are under our Great Song Council of Elders' rule, and we are arranging their life-long matters, naturally we must consider thoroughly. Otherwise, wouldn't we be treating commoners as non-humans, just like those usurper Ming officials who are filled with poetry yet behave like thieves and whores, forgetting loyalty for profit and burning bridges? Of course, Mr. Song, you don't belong to the majority of them, otherwise I wouldn't advise you to submit to our Great Song."

These words carried hidden barbs, leaving Song Yingsheng breathless. Although he wasn't convinced, the other party clearly occupied the moral high ground of "valuing the people." Rebutting wasn't easy. Of course, if he really wanted to argue, using the theory of "righteousness over trivial details" wouldn't be hard. But as a prisoner, there was no need to fight over momentary points. Besides, from the latter half of the speech, he knew this Great Song Council of Elders valued him highly—though somewhat inexplicably, it still made him somewhat proud. The Song brothers had passed the provincial exams simultaneously, becoming a celebrated story throughout Jiangxi, yet in the following years they repeatedly failed the metropolitan exams, not even achieving "Associate Doctor" status, and had to enter service through the selection of Juren. Not only was their official career limited, but they were also a rung lower in officialdom.

Unexpectedly, the Australians from thousands of miles away valued the brothers so highly. Song Yingsheng felt a surge of appreciation for understanding friends.

"Also, Mr. Song doesn't know our Great Song's customs. In the usurper Ming, as Mr. Song said, artisans and reformed prostitutes can be matched by simple list pairing, and gentry children's marriages are by parents' orders and matchmakers' words—men and women marry without meeting or understanding each other. We firmly oppose such customs or rules that ignore mutual understanding. We emphasize mutual willingness and voluntary choice upon meeting. We must consider the choices of both men and women. We can encourage and persuade, but absolutely cannot forcibly assign. That's why we hold these matchmaking conferences. Whether they succeed or not is their choice. Having made the choice, they must bear the various consequences. As for forced assignment, we advocate and support no such thing."

This "customs theory" was honestly unacceptable to Song Yingsheng. Though "parents' orders and matchmakers' words" might not be golden rules, they were the prevalent social custom. For men and women to marry out of mutual affection—according to ritual law, that was "illicit elopement"...

He remained silent, listening to Elder Du expound:

"...Moreover, under the Council of Elders' rule, naturalized citizens only differ in rank and title. Whether a county magistrate or a worker, they are all naturalized citizens without distinction of high or low. This is very different from the usurper Ming. Mr. Song will slowly understand this in the future." Du Yibin kept saying "usurper Ming," which greatly displeased Song Yingsheng. Speaking of "usurping," these two Zhao brothers were the veritable "usurpers."

Du Yibin was still expounding, but Song Yingsheng had no heart to listen further. From Elder Du's rambling, he had roughly understood why the Australians spared no expense to make a mountain out of a molehill. What they wanted was simply a demonstration effect, to let the commoners know the Council of Elders' "benevolence and righteousness," enticing poor commoners to submit to the hair-thieves.

Thinking back on the journey from Enping to Guangzhou, seeing the Australians' administration along the way, everything prioritized "mass interests," buying popular support, especially prioritizing the hearts of the poor. Although the local situation wasn't completely pacified, their reputation among the people wasn't bad.

He could imagine that under such petty favors, many Guangdong natives would voluntarily shave their heads to become naturalized citizens. Perhaps in not too many years, most residents of Guangdong would voluntarily do so. Without soldiers or weapons, they could make the people "change customs"! Thinking of this, he felt even more despair for the Ming's future, his face growing dark.

While the two talked, Qin Ruiyu led propaganda personnel to randomly interview registered couples—the *Sheep City Express* planned a special issue on this event. Not only to heavily promote the "new administration's new atmosphere" but also to discuss new-style marriage and free love in conjunction with the "New Life Movement"—though this official matchmaking could hardly be called free love, it set a precedent.

Qin Ruiyu didn't conduct interviews personally but "guided" intern reporters on-site.

Facing interviews, most men were experiencing such a scene for the first time. Mostly low-level workers and clerks with little education, their language skills poor, they stuttered, not knowing what to say, only repeating clichés like: thank the Council of Elders, long live the Council, will serve the Council and people better in the future... But their eyes and smiles vividly expressed their inner excitement and joy. The women had more to say. Though their language didn't quite fit the Council's usual propaganda style, their relatively simple, colloquial answers satisfied Elder Qin—he disliked some of the rigid propaganda language currently used by the propaganda department. Only later in the interviews did the students inevitably spout political slogans—all learned from Lu Cheng and other cadres. But this indirectly reflected their "learning results," satisfying Elder Qin. Lu Cheng naturally grinned from ear to ear.

"Alright, everyone sit in pairs. Let the reporters take photos of you. On the happy day, these will be given as congratulatory gifts." Qin Ruiyu instructed his subordinates to take photos, secretly regretting the Council hadn't yet replicated color photography technology.

Now, both students and naturalized citizens were somewhat shy. After all, yesterday they were strangers, now they were "fiancés." Taking this photo was like "betrothal"? It felt like a dream!

The lingering strangeness between men and women mixed with the reality of their "betrothal" made them somewhat bashful. Only under the urging and encouragement of naturalized reporters did they sit on the benches in pairs for their "wedding photos."

"Separate all successfully matched female students completely; don't let them mix with other students anymore," Du Yibin told Lu Cheng and the others. "Next is waiting for specific wedding notices—pay attention to the students' emotions. We also have to make preparations. Otherwise it'll be awkward without bridal chambers."

He spoke the truth. These naturalized staff and workers transferred to Guangzhou, except for a few who owned property in Lingao, mostly lived in dormitories or rented rooms. In Guangzhou, they also lived in collective dormitories.

Starting a family naturally required separate housing—this was another headache for Du Yibin.

Lu Cheng flushed red with excitement, nodding repeatedly: "I know! I'll definitely do their work well." As she spoke, her eyes reddened. "I'm not sad, I'm happy... really happy..."
