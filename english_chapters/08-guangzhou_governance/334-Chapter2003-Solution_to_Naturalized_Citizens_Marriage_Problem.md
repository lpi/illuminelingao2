# Chapter 2003 - Solution to Naturalized Citizens' Marriage Problem

Budget was hit back. But matter of finding wives for naturalized citizens still proceeded as usual. Most enthusiastic about this matter Senator Du Yibin happened to return to Guangzhou from Enping to handle matters at this moment. Preparing to utilize this vacancy to engage a vigorous Blind Date Assembly. Then engage a sound vast Collective Wedding. Budget hit back didn't extinguish his "Career Heart." Still grasping limited time running in and out Guangzhou City—"Finding Women."

This Senator Du caring about naturalized citizen marriage work started before conquering Guangzhou. He originally was a quite weird existence in Senate. His post was in Agriculture Mouth. Specifically engaging in breeding. Only animal he bred most was thing everyone didn't quite understand "Pangolin."

Although in 21st Century, pangolin already eaten basically extinct from wild by wild flavor lovers. But in 17th Century Great Ming, obviously their quantity was still many. And itself didn't have much edible value. Reason Senator Du Yibin bred pangolin said to be pangolin scale is important Chinese medicine material. So this matter counted obtaining Liu San's affirmation.

However, his breeding work basically still defined as "Not Attending Proper Business." Because learning computer, so also allocated extra to IT Department to work. Running both ends.

Regardless breeding pangolin or fixing computer, all had no relation with Civil Affairs work. Yet he just thought of this matter. Reason, actually was Human Resource Department unwilling to give able-bodied labor to him. Only full time worker of his pangolin farm was a disabled personnel. Contacting often in ordinary days. Chatting much. Naturally understood distress of these people.

From this to that. Senator Du started feeling himself should do something for them—After all he was a 21st Century person.

According to Senator Du's design. Those most urgently needing solving marriage problem were disabled soldiers and workers. Former number not many. Later could be quite not few—Casualty rate of Industrial Mouth was higher than Army by dozens of percentage points. Workers disabled by injury numerous. Although these people mostly arranged works within capacity. Basic life had no problem. But with their condition wanting to marry wife was basically impossible.

From perspective of pure interest. Senate need not care about these people's marriage problem—According to 17th Century moral level. Senate arranging simple work for them, ensuring their basic life, was already Great Philanthropist level. Marrying wife for them again, simply adding feet to snake.

"This matter we cannot look from interest perspective. Speaking back to bottom implies same meaning as we engaged Green Hill Cemetery, establishing monument for fallen soldiers initially. Person dying throwing corpse in wilderness and burying grandly in coffin actually have no difference. Funeral and cemetery, dead person cannot see also doesn't know. Speaking back to bottom still for living people to see." Du Yibin said so at a meeting of Civil Affairs Mouth.

Settlement of disabled is same reason. Although disabled soldiers and workers actually already lost value. But their situation will greatly influence those ordinary people currently serving and working.

"But people we need to solve are too many. Solving for disabled personnel first is it..."

"I feel they will understand. We even considered marrying wife matter for 'Useless' disabled personnel. Can we ignore their matters?"

This matter counted "Provisionally Passed" in Civil Affairs Mouth. But Provisionally Passed is only passed. Where to find "Wife" is the problem.

For ordinary cadres, soldiers and workers. This is nothing more than a time problem. Civil Affairs Mouth organizes several blind dates more. Engages some pairing activities more. Always can solve gradually. After all many people relying on Free Love also married wives.

But disabled personnel Du Yibin advocated solving first. Yet no woman would be willing to marry them. Even in 21st Century. Marriage of disabled people basically still pairing between disabled people.

Du Yibin considered for very long regarding how to solve this problem. Finally let him think out a method. But this more or less had some risk. He considered again and again. Decided to find Ran Yao to talk try.

Seeing Ran Yao was not easy—He was very busy. But this matter must be nodded by him.

Ran Yao felt surprised towards an unknown Agriculture Mouth Senator asking to see. But opponent after all was Senator. In emotion in reason he had to see.

"Ran Minister I won't delay your time. My hope coming this time is you giving me a policy. I have an idea now..." Du Yibin said. "Specifically speaking, whether can give special pardon or execution outside prison to light crime females currently serving sentence. Allocating to our disabled soldiers or workers as wives? Under normal circumstance, they basically can't get wives..."

He handed over his plan while speaking.

"...This is my preliminary design. You can take a look first."

He opening mouth made Ran Yao stunned. What does this guy want to do! This prisoner management is Judicial category. Basically not range he this People Security Minister manages. Besides this matter even if he can manage. Also no way to open this hole—How to say in Legal Principle?

He opened plan looking. Looked at Du Yibin with a kind of incredible gaze. This is truly a bit whimsical.

"This no way. Situation of Hainan male many female few you also know. Not doing so I truly can't think out how to solve their personal problem. I think there must be quite a few light crime female prisoners in Labor Camp. They have no hostility towards Senate itself. Should also be anxious to want coming out starting new life. To those female prisoners. This condition not calculated too bad..." Du Yibin handed a Early Sunny Edition Cigar to Ran Yao while speaking.

"Although we also have regulations of sentence reduction. But you doing like this won't do. Ma Jia side won't agree either. After all our law has no such regulation." Ran Yao shook head. "Actually your train of thought isn't no go. British people also did female exiled convicts to colony to solve immigrant marriage problem. But we have no legal support now—At least need Senate passing a temporary resolution."

"This I can do. I can do. As long as you can support..." Du Yibin said hurriedly. "Now is era of contending for world. We fully can borrow this to strive for more people's heart ah. Those small sections need not care. Special situation special treatment. Besides. Police system also has injured and disabled. We Senate as their boss should solve some problems of naturalized citizens. Unfilial has three no heir is big. Even in 21st Century personal problem is also nagged by parents. Let alone now."

"I have no opinion. But your plan somewhat takes for granted." Ran Yao patted cover of plan. Actually his speech more or less moved him too. Police disabled by public duty these years also had several. Almost all single. Although now all arranged in police system doing some auxiliary work. But wanting to solve their marriage problem is also a problem.

"First, female prisoners in our Labor Camp not many," Ran Yao said. "Female crime in this spacetime truthfully speaking is very few. Some light crimes we also mostly execute whipping or other summary punishment. Rarely sentencing to prison. So currently serving female prisoners basically are heavy crime prisoners or 'State Affair Prisoners.' These people. Former cannot reduce sentence pardon casually. Lateral how to dispose also isn't you and me can decide. Moreover many female prisoners already married before entering prison. Can meet your condition, cannot find five six out of hundreds."
