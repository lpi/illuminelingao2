# Chapter 1808: Educating the Next Generation

Before Zhang Yunmi left Lingao, she had specifically and sincerely asked Liu Xiang what it was like to be an administrative head. She only remembered that Liu Xiang looked troubled at the time and stared at her for a long time.

"Administrative work is roughly divided into civil servants and political appointees, but our current organizational structure and the size of the territory we control make the distinction between the two types not very obvious. However, it can be clearly stated that if one sincerely wants to do their job well, it is absolutely impossible to have the kind of 'newspaper and clear tea for a whole day' office loafing situation." Liu Xiang had no idea how to explain to a 'fresh meat' like Zhang Yunmi, who had absolutely no practical experience and relied entirely on imagination. Finally, out of helplessness, he silently installed a sailing background simulation management game on Zhang Yunmi's laptop, and then told her a "purely masochistic" game goal of "Full Maritime Trust."

"If you can really achieve a 24+2 city full maritime trust on your own, then you can probably understand 1/10th of the workload of a relatively responsible regional administrative head." Liu Xiang said to Zhang Yunmi in a tone that was both serious and smug: "I put a very useful modifier in there for you. Even if you use the modifier, that's not bad, because a trust cannot be modified out."

After getting over the aversion to the game's outdated graphics, Zhang Yunmi spent all her "spare time" in Hong Kong on this after leaving Lingao. After about a month of competing with herself, Zhang Yunmi was finally able to establish a self-sufficient small trust trade circle in the 6-port small area of the Baltic Sea without modification, and then she discovered that more troubles began.

In winter, agricultural production stopped, and the sea randomly froze ports...

Area XX needed to expand fish meat supply, but judging from past experience, new fishery buildings shouldn't be built immediately. Instead, lumberyards should be expanded at the timber production base first, and hemp planting plots expanded at the hemp production base, otherwise the industrial chain would collapse.

Military blockades destroyed production outside the city walls and simultaneously generated a large number of refugees. If there were not enough material reserves to survive the military disaster, production in the entire trade area would collapse.

Facing a pile of documents two palms high after organizing, Zhang Yunmi shook her head and retracted her thoughts from the divergent thinking just now. "It really is quite similar!" Zhang Yunmi couldn't help but feel a little admiration in her heart. "But actual work is more complicated! There is no convenient data viewing plug-in like PI in actual work." Zhang Yunmi's summary only extracted what the document was about and what requirements it had. The specific data and reports involved had to be read and analyzed by Liu Xiang himself. There were also many official documents that only mentioned difficulties and requirements without stating the specific situation. If this type wasn't sent back strictly for rewriting, manpower would have to be arranged to investigate.

Her gaze fell on several official documents picked out separately on the right. A look of disgust appeared on Zhang Yunmi's face. "The stuff from these guys is getting uglier and uglier. I must tell the BOSS." Stretching lazily without any regard for her image, Zhang Yunmi got up with these organized documents under her arm.

Knock! Knock! Knock! "Uncle Liu!"

"Come in!" Liu Xiang responded weakly.

"Uncle Liu, this batch is done. I'm completely helpless with the ones placed horizontally on top." Zhang Yunmi put the large pile of official documents in front of Liu Xiang and said with a wronged face.

"Okay, let me take a look first. You copy these few right here. Make a note on this one, then file it—my private memorandum file." Liu Xiang directly handed Hong Huangnan's "private official letter" to Zhang Yunmi.

Equipment like photocopiers was considered "non-essential electronic products" at the beginning. Except for bringing one to store in the warehouse as a sample template, none were brought at all. Copying documents had always been done by typing wax stencils in the printing room or hand-carving steel plates. When important official documents with extremely small copy volumes like this needed to be archived and backed up, or copied to others, they could only be truly "hand-copied." And the transcription of major classified documents between Senators could only be done by "politically trustworthy" personnel, such as "life secretaries who are loyal in body and mind to the Senators," or using Senators even more extravagantly like now.

"What the hell is written here!" Liu Xiang opened one of the official documents that Zhang Yunmi "couldn't handle." Looking at it, the neat four-six parallel prose structure instantly blinded his eyes—and this was before reading the content. Looking closely, there were a total of more than four hundred characters. Excluding twenty or thirty "artistic characters" with overly complex shapes that were squeezed together and hard to identify, the remaining readable characters combined to express this meaning: rare snow fell in Guangzhou last winter, which was an auspicious sign of Heaven and Earth cheering for the return of the Great Song, but this snow seriously affected people's production and life. The folks had insufficient grain reserves, yet still had to provide "Reasonable Burden" to support the army. The locality strongly requested that taxes be exempted during this year's summer harvest. Liu Xiang took great effort to "decipher" the superficial meaning of this article, but he felt that there must be some "trick" in this article—because some words and allusions were too uncomfortable to use. For example, when praising the distributed farm tools as easy to use, it wrote "Labor of bending the body, undertaken by women and children, looking up to the beauty of the plow (Mei)". Normal logic should have written "benefit (Li)", but whether it was normal logic or rhyme and tonal patterns, this word "Mei" should not have been used, yet it was used... Liu Xiang analyzed it slightly and discovered the trick.

"After all this, they're still playing 'hidden tail poems'!" Liu Xiang couldn't help but scold with a laugh, startling Zhang Yunmi into looking up at him inexplicably.

"Teacher Liu. What's the situation?"

Liu Xiang's certain special attribute instantly awakened.

"Well, this official document from Xinning County says that the local landlord class collectively petitioned, asking us to 'practice benevolent government' and exempt the tax for this year's summer harvest. The reason, firstly, is that it actually snowed last winter, and they also paid a round of 'Reasonable Burden'." Liu Xiang first stated the superficial reasons. "But this is not the point. The point is here." Liu Xiang pointed to the characters at the end of a few lines, skipping two lines to point once.

"Mei (Beauty), Qin (Celery), Yu (Desire), Xian (Present), Tai (Great), Shou (Prefect/Governor)..." Zhang Yunmi followed Liu Xiang's finger and recited these words silently in her heart, then stared with a pair of big eyes flickering in confusion.

Liu Xiang's desire to perform went full throttle.

"'Mei Qin' (Beautiful Celery), comes from 'Liezi · Yang Zhu'. It originally meant that the gift given, though meager like goose feathers, represents great intention. But used on us 'descendants of the Great Song', it has another meaning." Liu Xiang paused and said: "In order to save the swaying Song Dynasty, Xin Qiji once wrote a policy essay called 'Ten Presentations of Beautiful Celery' (Mei Qin Shi Xian). The person who wrote this official document compares himself to Xin Qiji; he wants to climb up the ladder!"

Zhang Yunmi was puzzled because the acting director of the Xinning County Office—naturalized citizen cadres were now serving as acting county-level chiefs—was a naturalized citizen. In her impression, he should be from a rich peasant background in Chengmai. Although there were many problems in his previous official correspondence, he absolutely wouldn't play with parallel prose like this—that rough fellow simply didn't have this cultural level.

After the question was raised, Liu Xiang just siged: "The counter-attack and infiltration methods of the old forces are really unexpected!" However, after sighing, he didn't explain much, just buried his head and switched to another official document to read.

Zhang Yunmi was left with a head full of question marks. Seeing that Liu Xiang didn't seem to want to perform further, she didn't pester him and turned back to continue her great cause of copying.

Zhang Yunmi turned back to continue copying, and Liu Xiang stopped talking and continued reading official documents. In fact, Liu Xiang read that parallel prose just for fun; the specific situation had long been notified by the Political Security side. Now Liu Xiang was waiting for the conclusion of further investigation before he could set the tone for the next step of work. But that was also a matter for the next step; what was more important now was the matter at hand.

The most urgent thing was naturally the issuance of the new currency. Fortunately, now that several capable generals from Wudaokou had arrived to preside over this area, he only needed to provide support and cooperation. The specific decision-making power lay in the hands of Chen Ce and the others.

The next problem was comprehensive urban governance. This matter had thousands of threads and was not easy to do. There was a heap of unresolved issues, but at least the police force had been pulled together, and grassroots governance was showing initial results. For Liu Xiang, the police system was an important network for the Senate to notify deep into the grassroots in Guangzhou. Almost all important civil affairs had to be executed through the police system and the baojia system managed by the police system. The police system actually also assumed the task of collecting basic public sentiment of the society. Therefore, the municipal administration of Guangzhou was basically "administrative policing." And the upcoming "rectification of the customs industry" was another major play in police work.

As he was considering how to discuss specific work with Mu Min next, Zhang Yunmi suddenly asked: "Uncle Liu, is the thing you guys have been discussing recently about organizing the brothels in Guangzhou?"

Liu Xiang was startled. Although this matter was not specifically avoided in front of Little Zhang, he never discussed it speificially in front of her. After all, this was somewhat awkward for a female.

"Indeed it is."

"I have a question. After we entered the city, there were thousands of things to do. There should be many things more urgent than rectifying brothels and prostitutes, right? Why start with this?"

Liu Xiang coughed and said: "This is actually an administrative question. Let me test you first, why did we choose this as the entry point?"

"If you say it's for women's liberation, I don't think it's quite like that," Zhang Yunmi smiled slightly, "Is it to expand the city government's fiscal revenue?"

Liu Xiang nodded with a smile: "That is only one of the reasons."

"And the second?"

"We came to Guangzhou to do administrative work. In fact, we are doing the work of revolution." Seeing Zhang Yunmi starting to curl her lips, revealing a kind of "here we go again" complaining expression, Liu Xiang felt that the political education at the Academy had not reached the roots.
