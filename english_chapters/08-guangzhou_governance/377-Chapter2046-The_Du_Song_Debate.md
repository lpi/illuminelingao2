# Chapter 2046 - The Du-Song Debate

"Master Song, what's the matter?" Du Yibin saw Song Yingsheng with eyes tightly closed, looking like "see no evil," and couldn't help but smile inwardly. A man like him naturally couldn't stand seeing "white legs." Moreover, dancing had always been closely related to "sexuality" since ancient times.

Song Yingsheng shook his head. Though he opened his eyes, he directed his gaze deep into the hall, avoiding looking at the stage.

Though he'd been following Du Yibin for over half a year, seeing many new things and new ideas—and though Australian women's revealing attire wasn't new to him—seeing Zhang Yunmi also come on stage to dance was far beyond his comprehension.

He knew that Australian Elders were the most noble of people, their status not as simple as Ming's "imperial clan." With Zhang Yunmi's position, in the Ming she would be like a Princess Royal—perhaps even higher, since Ming's Princess Royal could neither hold official positions nor wield power.

For such a noble and powerful young woman to casually wear what he considered nearly "half-naked" clothing and dance on stage, with expressions and movements more seductive than any woman he had ever seen—

In Song Yingsheng's mind, the Plaid Skirt Club corresponded to Ming's "Music Bureau," with performers equivalent to musician-courtesans. For a female Elder to mingle with a group of musician-courtesans dancing was nothing short of self-debasement. Yet the Australians seemed accustomed to it, thinking nothing of it—truly "licentious" to the extreme.

Actually, since his capture, Song Yingsheng's impression of the Australians had never been bad. Yet he could never accept the Australians' "frivolity" regarding gender relations and clothing. Today's dance performance only reinforced this view.

After a long while, he finally uttered: "Shameless!"

Originally, he hadn't wanted to speak at all, but his inner agitation made him unable to hold back his opinion.

Du Yibin actually found this old man's conservative attitude most intolerable. He said:

"Master Song, this is our women's performing group, an arts organization—not Ming's Music Bureau, nor musician-courtesans! They are the Council of Elders' cultural workers, all proper naturalized citizens! Elder Zhang used to be the star of this arts group. Coming to dance at this collective wedding is also a blessing from our Council of Elders to the grooms and brides, demonstrating that we and the broad masses are of one heart and body, treating each other as equals, never being arrogant about status."

"This dance is certainly different from Ming's dance music. Though it may seem somewhat 'shocking' to the common people, it actually reflects the thriving, vigorous spirit under our Council of Elders' rule..."

Song Yingsheng grumbled internally: If wearing less shows spirit, wouldn't dancing naked show even more spirit! He said slowly: "Chief Du! These days I've been treated with such courtesy, and this student is embarrassed to receive it. I have a few heartfelt words here too..."

Du Yibin was delighted, thinking: There's an opening!

"The Council of Elders is now pushing northward. Its ambitions go without saying. Now that the Council's forces are strong, heroes and talents throughout the realm will surely flock to join. But this tendency toward seductive appearance and licentiousness must not be allowed to spread. Not only does it sap fighting spirit, but it also earns the contempt of heroes throughout the realm." After saying this, Song Yingsheng's face flushed slightly. Having spoken, he felt he wasn't being "purely loyal" anymore. Yet he couldn't help wanting to say it.

Du Yibin was about to respond but was stopped.

"Chief Du, you don't need to explain. This student understands: the Council of Elders has the intention of 'changing customs.' So they don't hesitate to have female Elders, despite their noble status, lower themselves to use song and dance as tools, appearing in public to promote this trend. This is the worst possible strategy!"

As he spoke, Song Yingsheng became somewhat agitated.

"Since ancient times, licentiousness and corruption have been the greatest destroyers of hearts. Elders are the nation's most exalted, the model for the people. One cannot take pride in this, much less take the lead—not only is it a disgrace, but it also corrupts the pure hearts of the people."

When Du Yibin heard him still tangled up in this issue, he couldn't help but feel impatient. But then he thought: though these words might not suit the Council of Elders' taste, they were "remonstrance," entirely from the standpoint of considering the Council's interests. This was the biggest change so far.

He thought for a moment and said mildly: "Master Song! I completely understand your good intentions. Since we arrived in Lingao, those who curse the Council of Elders as licentious, shameless, and depraved are as numerous as river carp. No, you don't need to explain—by Ming's customs, these words aren't wrong. But surely you know that today's newlyweds were all former low-class prostitutes?"

Song Yingsheng nodded silently.

"When the Guangzhou Municipal Government regulated the vice industry, I can't recall exactly how many prostitutes were registered. But the total was around three thousand. In a city of just five hundred thousand like Guangzhou, there were three thousand courtesans. The women plying their trade in Tanka boats on the river were countless more. What does that say about Ming's moral atmosphere? Would you call that 'following proper conduct'?"

Song Yingsheng was startled: "Guangzhou is southern barbarian territory, with foreign merchants gathering from overseas..."

"Fine then, let's talk about the capital." Du Yibin said. "The northern and southern capitals, at the foot of the Emperor's throne, are supposedly lands of exemplary virtue. But Ming scholars themselves said: 'In Yanjing, prostitutes outnumber respectable families.' Not to mention the male brothels, passing men off as women, inverting yin and yang, for officials and gentry's pleasure. What about that?"

At this, Song Yingsheng's face showed some embarrassment. Speaking of social atmosphere, he hadn't been to Lingao and couldn't judge, but it wasn't an exaggeration that Australian-ruled Guangzhou's social atmosphere was several times better than either capital.

"...If someone is naturally inclined toward men and prefers them to women, that's one thing. But in these male brothels, both buyers and sellers are men all the same. Sellers do it out of necessity, but what about buyers? Nothing but satisfying desires. How is that compared to women dancing here?"

"This..." Song Yingsheng thought that consorting with courtesans was a private matter, at most a dozen people gathering to drink and make merry. Even if someone was especially dissolute, creating scandals, it still wasn't in front of the general public.

"Being in public is indeed somewhat unsightly." Song Yingsheng knew there was no point arguing about moral issues. His opponent understood Ming officials and gentry's moral standards quite well. Any further defense would only get him reprimanded.

He didn't want to argue further on this issue. He had long known: there were many things Elder Du couldn't convince him of, just as he couldn't convince Elder Du. Besides, he had also slightly perceived the Australians' "imperial statecraft"—saying more would serve no purpose.

Ignoring the cheers rising wave after wave outside and the deafening music, he asked quietly:

"So the Elders crossed the sea not just to contend for the Central Plains, but also to change the established ways of a thousand years."

"Ha ha, well said!" Du Yibin nodded. "Exactly so."

"Then, wouldn't that be overturning the natural order..." Song Yingsheng's tone grew somewhat nervous.

"Overturning the natural order? Something like that." Du Yibin gazed at the performance on the stage outside. Zhang Yunmi had changed into a different costume, her hairstyle slightly altered too, face glistening with sweat under the lights, makeup somewhat smeared. Yet her eyes sparkled, every smile like an electric charge, making the audience below drunk with admiration, cheering in rhythm. Even he, from the old timeline, was deeply captivated by her.

"If we can't fundamentally change this world, without some boldness and ideals, we were doing just fine in Australia—why come here?" Du Yibin said. (Actually I just want to prevent extinct animals from going extinct due to human causes—of course, that requires a great nation to accomplish.)

"These established ways were set by sages and have continued for a thousand years. How can they be changed just like that?" Song Yingsheng was shocked by this young man's audacity.

"Master Song, I'm not a classical scholar and don't understand the various philosophical schools. The sages' words naturally have their merits, but can the sages' words save the current crisis of China?" Du Yibin said seriously. "In Ming's court and countryside, from the Emperor down to unenlightened *juren* and *xiucai*, who hasn't read extensively and 'spoken on behalf of the sages'? Yet look at Ming now. Moreover, since the Han Dynasty made Confucianism supreme, nearly two thousand years have passed. Dynasties rise and fall, chaos and order alternate—has there been the slightest change? Our Council of Elders not only seeks to conquer the realm but to break this cycle of rise and fall, letting millions of common people live like humans!"

"Dynastic rise and fall is heaven's mandate—not the fault of the sages..." Song Yingsheng felt like "there's no way to explain this to you." In his view, the current moral decline was precisely the result of court and countryside "not following the sages' words" and "lacking proper education." He paused slightly: "Chief Du, you once said the Council of Elders is determined to not let the realm's poor people be 'two-legged sheep' generation after generation. To break the unchanging pattern of a thousand years, to end this cycle of rise and fall. This student is too old and may not live to see it. But Elders also have finite lifespans. Even if you maintain it while living, what happens after you're all gone? Since ancient times, winning an empire is easier than keeping it. Taizu was once meticulous in suppressing powerful families' land annexation and severely punishing official corruption—he was not lacking in effort, and the atmosphere was renewed for a time. What about now?"

"So we need to do things differently." Du Yibin smiled. "The old ways don't work anymore. If we followed the old path, we could take the throne in three to five years. But as the saying goes, 'his rise was sudden, his fall will be sudden too.'"

Unbelievable! Song Yingsheng thought—how can governing a nation be trial and error!

"How can we know right from wrong without trying?" Du Yibin sighed. "Taking a wrong path doesn't matter, as long as we acknowledge mistakes and can correct them. What's dangerous is knowing you're on the wrong path but insisting on walking it to the end—then sooner or later you'll fall to your death. As for our cause, there will naturally be successors who can inherit our legacy and continue it. Perhaps one day they too will stray, will fall. But by then, I believe the people won't accept going back to being two-legged sheep. They'll know how to walk their own path."
