# Chapter 1986 - Clues

"Excel in learning to become an official." Zeng Juan had long given up this idea as he had no achievements in the imperial examination path. Who knew that the world would turn, and he would end up "excelling in learning to become an official" under the Australians? It was a great irony.

He worked very hard these days. "A thousand-li horse is common, but a Bole is rare." Don't know why, ever since sitting in this position, Zeng Juan suddenly felt he had transformed from that student who had difficulty even passing the elementary exam into a "thousand-li horse," and this Bole was exactly the three Chiefs of the Finance and Tax Bureau—no, the Australian Senate. Treat one as a scholars-bureaucrat, and one repays as a scholar-bureaucrat. Although he knew he was thousands of miles away from being a scholar-bureaucrat, he recently liked to recite this sentence in his heart.

Director Zhang Xiaoqi returned to Lingao not long after the first quarter collection period ended. The remaining Chief Wang lectured them like crazy. The lecture time after work every day increased by another hour from the original two hours, specifically teaching Australian basic culture courses. Everyday they dismissed only at 9 or 10 PM under stars and moon. Those older men with families complained privately that they didn't even have the strength to spank their wives' bare bottoms; could this Chief Wang not bear to see couples warm on the kang? Not only that, they found that at the beginning of the month, a white wooden sign had quietly been hung outside the classroom, written in bold Song typeface: "Great Song Finance and Tax Bureau Cadre Training School."

It's better to be a single dog. Zeng Juan wiped another handful of sweat. He heard this term from Director Ai and felt an indescribable sense of joy. Remembered last meeting, he blurted out "single dog" when chatting with Director Nan next to him, scaring Director Nan into silence for a long time; it was truly awkward. Speaking of Director Nan, Zeng Juan felt this woman was truly formidable. Heard a few days ago two drunk idlers came to the hall. At that time, all staff had just changed into linen short-sleeved summer uniforms. Men were fine, but when these female cadres sat at the windows—in new Lingao speak, "a row of white arms blinded my krypton dog eyes"—even naturalized citizens' hearts would skip a beat upon seeing, let alone these two fellows. They couldn't get up the window counters, so they pestered Liu Cuihua on duty that day at the tax guidance desk by the door, trying to grab hands and touch arms within a few sentences. Faster than words could tell, didn't know when this Director Nan came out from the counter, she kicked one under the table and pinned the other on the table cleanly and neatly with just one move. Immediately the duty security police in the hall came up and handcuffed both away. Afterwards, he told everyone everywhere that Director Nan of the Tax Hall had good skills, truly a heroine among women.

Without Zhang Xiaoqi sitting in town, the Finance and Tax Bureau's second quarter collection work still ended smoothly. The girls in the Tax Hall didn't fail the Senate's expectations. After half a year of experience, they already looked quite like professional cadres. Even facing nearly double the new taxpayers due to expanded collection scope, they could handle various emergencies methodically. Especially Nan Wan'er as the Director of the Tax Hall; many matters were "final judgment" with her. her handling was gentle yet principled, making Ai Zhixin and Wang Qiyi look at this "heroine" who was a poor martial arts student and almost a kitchen maid a few years ago with new eyes.

Leaving these aside, that Zeng Juan could go on this mission today was largely due to Nan Wan'er too. As the saying goes, birds of a feather flock together. Zhang Xiaoqi had high talent in memory, so Nan Wan'er whom she fancied also had exceptional memory. The Finance and Tax Bureau stipulated that internal collection, management, and inspection should be separated in principle, but information should be shared through duplicate ledgers weekly. Last week when Zeng Juan went to pick up the declaration duplicate ledgers of taxpayers under his group's jurisdiction, Nan Wan'er specifically reminded him that Noble Gathering suddenly self-declared a Stamp Tax at the end of the collection period, which had a not small gap with the paid amount of two quarters.

In the first quarter collection, besides large merchants in Guangzhou city, the Luo Family's Noble Gathering, ranking front among medium merchants in Guangzhou, was also listed in the tax list as a "supplementary player." As soon as the second quarter collection started, Advisor Liao of Noble Gathering paid all Property Tax and Circulation Tax on the second day. If not for this Stamp Tax, everything would be normal.

After getting the tax duplicate register, Zeng Juan carefully studied Noble Gathering's declared tax amounts for two consecutive quarters. He found that compared to over 200 yuan of Property Tax and over 100 yuan of Circulation Tax per quarter, this Stamp Tax was a full 15 yuan. According to the 0.05% tax rate, this transaction amount was not lower than 30,000 yuan. This was too rare for a medium merchant. Although he knew the basic situation of taxpayers under his jurisdiction like the back of his hand, for safety, Zeng Juan still looked up the registration materials of this taxpayer from the census archives.

Noble Gathering was established in the first year of Chongzhen, i.e., 1628 AD. The legal representative was Luo Zhixiang. Census assets were about 90,000 yuan. Business scope was north-south bulk goods. According to Great Song Finance and Tax Bureau regulations, documents like property rights transfer and purchase contracts must have stamps pasted in obvious places to be considered valid. Zeng Juan felt normal business of such traditional trading enterprises generally wouldn't involve property rights transfer, and a purchase contract of over 30,000 yuan was not something this medium shop could afford. Moreover, this Stamp Tax exploited the loophole of current single and rough tax items during declaration, only writing "sales document" vaguely in the declaration reason, making Zeng Juan feel even more suspicious. So he applied for a household entry permit from the Management Division according to standard procedures, going to this Master Luo's home to see exactly where this Stamp Tax came from.

It was near sunset when Zeng Juan walked out of the Luo family gate. The resistance encountered in this household entry was unusually large. The Luo family first excused that the Chief Accountant Advisor Liao wasn't in, then said accounts were kept by him alone and others couldn't see. Later, after pulling back and forth for over an hour, seeing Zeng Juan relentless about seeing where the stamp was pasted, otherwise he would bring them back to the Finance and Tax Bureau for questioning and fine them for intentionally destroying tax receipts, the Luo family softened and brought the sales document. Advisor Liao also "returned to the mansion" at the right time.

Looking at the relevant documents, actually the sale was very simple. It was the Luo family selling a piece of land near Great World to, to... Zeng Juan's eyelid twitched. Zhang Family Father and Son Food Company?

After Zhang Yu split from his father, the old shop changed to "Zhang Family Old Shop Food Company," while Zhang Yu's company was "Zhang Family Father and Son Co., Ltd." Adding "Father and Son" was mainly to show that although father and son split business, they were still of one heart, to avoid public gossip.

Zeng Juan licked his lips, put down the contract, picked up the cup, and sipped tea lightly.

"Hehe, such a simple contract, no problem either. Since it has stamps, why push and block when I wanted to see? Isn't it just selling a piece of land? Wasted everyone's several hours for nothing."

"Yes yes, originally no big matter. Our Dongjia felt our shop is small and won't use it till death, better to sell it for current gains." Advisor Liao filled Zeng Juan's teacup while saying yes yes. "In the past, everyone feared the government. Those boys haven't seen our Australian cadres, thought it was black like before, fearing getting extorted regardless of reason if shown, so they covered it. Comrade Zeng, please don't blame..."

"Advisor Liao, don't be like this; I can't bear the word 'Old' [in 'You Old']. " Zeng Juan picked up the file bag, stood up and straightened his uniform, greeting his team members. "Alright then, let's go."

Walking on the street, Zeng Juan was still dizzy. Why did this matter coincidentally involve Zhang Yu? Should be nothing big, just simple land trading; he comforted himself. But intuition told him this large-amount land transaction and the Luo family's behavior were obviously not that simple.

Eh? Who is that ahead? The figure looks familiar.

Huang Ping? Yao Yulan? Why are they together?

Zeng Juan was a cautious person. Originally he wanted to dodge, but now they were almost face to face. Dodging again would be too deliberate, inviting misunderstanding instead.

Others misunderstanding was no big deal. But Huang Ping and Yao Yulan were cadres transferred from Lingao. Unlike them from public exam backgrounds, if they said an extra word in front of Chiefs, he would be in trouble.

At once, he piled smiles on his face and greeted with a slightly surprised expression:

"Brother Huang! Sister Yulan!" Although the bureau required everyone to call each other "Comrade," Zeng Juan still couldn't change over, accustomed to calling brothers and sisters. He felt this was more intimate. Fortunately, the term "Comrade" was just a "suggestion," not "regulation."

"Hey, Ah Juan! Long time no see."

"Isn't it. Since you went to the Inspection Division, I haven't seen you again. Heard you went to Lingao for training? Must be a promotion." Zeng Juan made routine pleasantries while sizing up the two. Huang Ping seemed to have lost weight but felt more spirited. Zeng Juan also knew Yao Yulan; seeing her this time, no much change except darker.

"Where's that coming from? We just went to study. You can ask Yao Yulan if you don't believe. I'll treat you another day; we brothers chat properly." Huang Ping looked up at the sun. "But today we have something to do, must go first. See you."

"Then you busy yours; I happen to have something too. Talk later, I'll treat you." Zeng Juan complained secretly: real business or fake business? Truly strange. Miss Yao's temper was unusual; could Brother Huang stand it?

Sending off Huang Ping, a cool breeze blew, giving the sweaty Zeng Juan a small relief. In a split second, he suddenly realized he made a fatal mistake at the Luo family just now. Didn't the Luo family make money selling land? He only thought about Zhang Yu and forgot to check how much the Luo family earned from selling land. Otherwise, comparing with the second quarter Circulation Tax Declaration Form back at the bureau would tell if his family evaded tax. No, no need to compare at all. 30,000 yuan land, even without studying Australian tax law, just based on Zeng Juan's common sense for so many years, the profit earned couldn't be capped by 100 yuan Circulation Tax. But the household entry permit was one-time; according to regulations, he couldn't go to the Luo family again. What to do?

Zhang Yu. Right, Zhang Yu. Can't go to the seller; the buyer Zhang Yu as a businessman should roughly know how much the Luo family earned. Pity it's late now; going to Great World isn't realistic. Only hope Zhang Yu returned to stay in the city tonight.
