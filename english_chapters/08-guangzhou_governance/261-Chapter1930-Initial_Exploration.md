## Chapter 1930 - Initial Exploration

In the old timeline, this wouldn't have been much of a problem. Ordinary server rooms had multiple data backups; if a hard drive broke, you just bought a new one. But here, hard drives, as carriers of precious data storage, were extremely valuable items. Once a hard drive was damaged without a backup, it meant the complete loss of a portion of knowledge. Feng Nuo had to attend to them carefully, squeezing the maximum value out of every drive.

Elders' personal computers began to malfunction and suffer irreversible damage. Those that weren't broken also had varying degrees of component wear, aging, and failure. Although the high-performance/large-capacity clusters of the Computing Center and Data Center were currently operating normally, he had to ensure carefully that the servers could run for another ten or twenty years.

The Computing Center brought by the Elders on the ship consisted of several sets of blade servers, plus some fat nodes, accompanied by high-speed disk arrays with capacities of tens of terabytes for storage. The Data Center consisted of a small number of service nodes and ordinary disk arrays measured in petabytes. There was also a tape backup system.

Equipment wasn't abundant, but the total investment exceeded ten million—the Senate couldn't afford any more. After all, every industry was reaching out for money and loading quotas at that time. If computer systems didn't carry huge reserves of knowledge, they would be completely viewed as "luxury toys" by some Elders.

Because computer components were basically impossible to manufacture within the Elders' lifetimes, the storage and use of equipment were calculated down to the last penny.

According to relevant orders issued by the Planning Commission in previous years, one set (piece) of all equipment had to be set aside and transported to Gaoshanling to be sealed as original standard equipment templates, not listed in usable reserves. Therefore, Feng Nuo reduced the number of operating units, only ensuring necessary usage. Now a mirror of the Data Center was placed over at the Great Library. Feng Nuo's equipment here was barely maintaining normal operation.

In the early days of the crossing, the Computing Center's protection measures against moisture, dust, static electricity, and constant temperature were severely insufficient, which somewhat affected the lifespan of the equipment, especially the hard drives in the disk arrays.

Theoretically, the operating life of servers is very long. Running without shutdown for seven or eight years is common. If maintained properly, running for more than ten years is no problem. Of course, the premise is sufficient maintenance, especially timely replacement of accessories; this is why servers need to support hot swapping.

To ensure hot backups of all cluster disk arrays as much as possible, Feng Nuo currently only turned on half the blades. Then he adopted a rotation method of booting and periodic booting to extend lifespan. The Computing Center was turned on for two months every two months. The Data Center rotated operation with the mirror at the Great Library.

Speaking of which, the Data Center was actually more important than the Computing Center. The Computing Center was mainly used by people in the industrial and military sectors. Large-scale computing tasks in other fields were few, mostly handled on Elders' personal computers and departmental-level small servers. The Data Center, however, was a place no department could do without. For ownership and management rights of the Data Center, the Great Library and the Planning Commission had torn into each other several times. The Great Library believed their core resource was actually the content in the Data Center, while the Planning Commission insisted on the principle of centralized management and use, demanding the Computing and Data Centers be placed together.

The two sides took it to the Executive Committee. In the end, indexing, management, viewing, and auditing of data content went to the Great Library, while the Planning Commission was only responsible for hardware and software maintenance. Later, during the second anti-encirclement combat readiness, a set of mirrors was transferred to the Great Library for offline operation. First, as a secure backup; second, to facilitate the Great Library's compilation of indexes and planning of the "Data Paperization" project. Moreover, the power supply over there had also stabilized.

The Data Center was originally planned to have 3 sets of mirrors backing each other up. Running in the current rotating boot mode, it was estimated that maintaining for another 10 to 20 years wouldn't be a big problem. What was vigilant was that recently there had been cases of personally carried portable hard drives breaking—Feng Nuo could still fix simple computer glitches, but if a hard drive broke completely, Feng Nuo didn't have the skill for data recovery.

Equally worrying as hard drives was memory. Fortunately, these things were small in volume, and they had stocked quite a few memory chips preserved in sealed deoxygenated packaging.

All signs indicated that the data and information processing capabilities the Senate prided itself on had begun to decline. Feng Nuo felt the hat on his head and his livelihood were also unsteady.

Currently, the Senate's "de-informatization" had been proceeding for several years and was quite deep. Not only had a large batch of important technical and historical materials completed sinicization, paperization, and indexing, but departmental business dealings had also completely detached from computers and networks. New office buildings no longer laid wired and wireless networks. Elders' private and official information transmission gradually stopped using USB drives or email. Fewer people posted on the BBS, while *Weekly Developments* and *Morning Star* grew thicker. *Nature and Science* changed from a monthly to a weekly. Even after relevant Executive Committee agencies moved to the county seat, work efficiency slightly improved.

It could be said that even if all computer equipment collapsed immediately, the Senate could continue to maintain itself. Of course, the replication of the tech tree would suffer a severe blow. After all, paperizing petabytes of data wasn't realistic; currently, only the conceivable, most critical technical data was being preserved. After the start of the Second Five-Year Plan, the Planning Commission, the Technology Sector, and the Industrial Sector were already compiling the Senate's medium-to-long-term technology and industrial development plan—that is, roughly determining the tech tree for the next 20 to 50 years. Only then could they clarify needs and carry out the next step of technical data paperization work.

As for computing power, the Senate still had a final batch of reserves. In the dark, oxygen-deficient Planning Commission special controlled goods warehouse in the Gaoshanling caves, there were several tightly sealed containers. Using periodically replaced lime desiccant and iron powder antioxidant, the IT group's "final reserve" was preserved. They were all tightly sealed in special packaging. Most were industrial WeChat microcontrollers using embedded systems—at least their computing processing power was absolutely sufficient. Most critically, they were light and cheap; a container could hold tens of thousands. Smartphone motherboards—some wholesale from Huaqiangbei, some cheaper imported electronic waste. Plus portable scientific calculators. The goal was to ensure that for 100 years, the Senate would possess computing power and data processing and analysis capabilities superior to other regions of the world. Before most of the Senate's computer systems failed, these unremarkable little things could at least barely guarantee maintenance until the Senate could rebuild the computer industrial system—Feng Nuo estimated that, optimistically, it would take about 50 years.

Naturally, Feng Nuo set his sights on the predecessor of the computer: the mechanical computer. In fact, the development plan for mechanical computers had a long history. As early as the First Five-Year Plan, the Industrial Sector began work on imitating hand-cranked calculators.

Yes, imitation. As the saying goes, what those above favor, those below will outdo. Hand-cranked calculator manufacturing had already been initiated two years ago, but no one had asked Feng Nuo if he wanted to participate, so Feng Nuo had remained an outsider. This wasn't really a matter for computer people; it was purely a mechanical design and manufacturing problem.

"Can a hand-cranked calculator be called a computer? At best, it's just a calculator!" Feng Nuo thought with some sourness and would complain fiercely whenever he grabbed an old colleague. Even Feng Shan's ears had grown calluses from listening.

But the imitation career of this hand-cranked computer, or hand-cranked calculator, didn't go smoothly and hadn't completely succeeded even now. Initially, of course, the project team aimed at the pinnacle of hand-cranked calculators—Curta. Before the crossing, the preparatory group specifically bought two original units from eBay at a high price: one Type I and one Type II.

Disassemble, imitate, fail.

It was no wonder. The Curta was only the size of a spice jar but was actually composed of more than 600 parts. The design was extremely exquisite, and the processing extremely precise. There were many springs, gears, rollers, and other workpieces that Lingao's current processing technology couldn't pass or wasn't mature enough for, and they were extremely small with high precision requirements. There were even rubber and plastic auxiliary parts—"in Lingao, these can only be replaced with wood and leather."

Although the era which produced the Curta didn't have the divine tool of CNC machine tools and it was entirely completed by workers' manual manufacturing and assembly, the Senate didn't have such strong workers. If CNC machine tools were used for processing, the precision could be met, but the materials completely failed to meet processing needs.

Exact replication was impossible, so they had to settle for second best: scaled-up replication.

The successfully replicated sample turned out to be the size of a water bucket. Not only was the crank position no longer reasonable, but human strength could barely turn it. The self-weight was a major problem—forget portability; even moving it was difficult. Because tolerances didn't meet requirements and material mechanical strength was weak, wear was severe during testing.

A few units of the Curta scaled-up replica were eventually sent to the Human Computing Center. At least for calculating four arithmetic operations of more than ten digits, as well as reciprocals and square roots, it was more powerful than an abacus. So when it was first sent, it caused quite a stir among the naturalized human calculators. However, it was obvious that this thing was a serious waste of manpower: to be used for a long time, one or two dedicated crank turners had to be equipped to cooperate with the calculator; otherwise, the calculator would soon be exhausted.

Next came replicating earlier desktop hand-cranked computers. The object was a "Cultural Brand" hand-cranked computer.

In the old timeline, the types of hand-cranked computers produced domestically were very limited. The most common were only the "Cultural Brand" from Tianjin Red Star Factory and the "Flying Fish Brand" from Shanghai Computer Typewriter Factory. The former was "lever-style," while the latter was "keyboard-style." Both were imitations of foreign brands like Brunsviga, Felix, Tiger, Marchant, Monroe, etc. The control methods differed, but the mechanical principles were largely the same. Later there were also electric computers, but they just changed hand-cranked to electric, saving the human effort of turning the crank.
