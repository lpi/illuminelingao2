# Chapter 2033 - Daoist Cui Discusses Dao

"Secondly, 'Dao' is used by Laozi to explain the origin, ontology, laws, principles, realm, and ultimate truth of the universe, etc. 'The Dao follows nature' means the Dao models itself after or follows nature; that is to say, the operating principles of all things follow natural laws. The word that best expresses 'Dao' is natural law. Similarly, conversely, the word closest to the natural laws we speak of here is 'Dao'. This includes the Dao of nature, the Dao of society, and the Dao of humans. The Dao is the law by which heaven, earth, and all things operate; Virtue (De) is the worldly rule that human society should commonly follow as a projection of the Dao of Heaven! This is the so-called Daode (Morality)..."

Cui Hantang spoke extravagantly, flowers falling from the sky. Unfortunately, except for Li Qiushui and a few others who listened with keen interest, several of the *tongsheng* origin couldn't understand at all, and could only casually echo: "The Superior Master speaks brilliantly."

After this extravagant preaching, the Daoist disciples served tea and snacks, and everyone rested and chatted. The tea and snacks here were quite famous. At first, some scholars actually came just for these—after all, for them, the Zhang family's "Australian-style tea and snacks" were not very affordable.

Nominally "resting," it was actually a "current affairs lecture." As the old saying goes: women and politics are the topics men love to discuss most. For these scholars, discussing women was somewhat "unbecoming of refinement," so "current affairs" became the most common topic during breaks. Cui Hantang also intentionally steered towards this, partly to broaden the horizons of these scholars "actively seeking progress," and partly as "brainwashing."

Recently, what they discussed was mainly the roving bandits within the country. Honestly, since the roving bandits started in Shaanxi at the end of the Tianqi reign, their influence had grown over seven or eight years. Recently they even directly captured Fengyang and burned the Ming Imperial Ancestral Tomb, shaking the world. But for these bottom-layer scholars who had lived in Guangdong all their lives and never traveled far, it was a matter of another world. Some, like Zeng Juan and the others back then, had read Australian magazines and knew a little, but most knew nothing of the sequence of events regarding these roving bandits. Cui Hantang started from the Wang Er rebellion in Chengcheng, Shaanxi in the third month of the seventh year of Tianqi, speaking to the famine rebellions of Wang Jiayin, Wang Daliang, Gao Yingxiang, Zhang Xianzhong and others in the eighth year of Tianqi; continuing to the "appeasement as primary, suppression as secondary" under Three Borders Governor-General Yang He, a temporary pacification under soft and hard tactics; then to the union of various "camp headers" starting in the fourth year of Chongzhen, forming the "Thirty-six Battalions"... Covering everything in detail, he spoke day after day. It was fortunate that Cui Hantang was a storytelling enthusiast; he could actually narrate this messy pile of events with meticulous detail and clear logic, attracting everyone to listen as if to a storytelling session—feeling uncomfortable if they missed a day.

On this day, Cui Hantang was discoursing broadly again. Of course, he wasn't entirely "telling stories"; he was more guiding the scholars to "think about problems." And this thinking couldn't be too shallow; one couldn't simply analyze with dualism like "dim ruler and corrupt officials." It had to go deeper.

Naturally, this requirement was a bit high for them, but Cui Hantang believed it wasn't too difficult—as long as they read more background materials, they would naturally cultivate the ability to analyze materials. As for background materials, there were plenty in the library he ran here.

Based on his high discourse, everyone began to discuss enthusiastically. The content of the discussion ranged from the gains and losses of the court's administration, the strategic movements of the peasant army, to the considerations and specific actions of the court's several suppression and appeasement campaigns—nothing was off-limits. Cui Hantang had had his fill of papers and monographs; picking up various viewpoints and data at will, he could casually spout many structured arguments, naturally making the scholars look at him with new eyes.

Waiting until the spit had been sprayed and tea refilled several times, Li Qiushui finally couldn't help interjecting to ask: "Last time the Daoist Master said 'The Ming Chongzhen Emperor will sooner or later be harmed by roving bandits'—was that a casual remark or words divined from heavenly secrets?"

At these words, the scholars all showed expressions of concern.

Actually, that sentence was something Cui Hantang had accidentally let slip last time—such "heavenly secrets" he generally only deigned to reveal to people of Li Suiqiu's level; Li Qiushui and the others really couldn't enjoy it. But since it was said, there was no need to hide it. As commoners who until recently lived under Ming rule, concern for this issue was a matter of course. Moreover, many of them were *xiucai* who had passed examinations in the Ming; although they now intended to defect to the Hair, they still harbored some affection for this "former dynasty and homeland" in their hearts, unwilling to see its destruction just like that.

Cui Hantang knew these Confucian scholars still turned their hearts to the Ming, thinking he might as well give them some strong medicine to sever their longings. So he closed his eyes and remained silent, only counting on his fingers. After a long while, he said: "In the year of Jiaxu, it rained blood in Haifeng, the earth quaked in Yingtian, and a star fell in Datong; the intent of Ming's fortune has already gradually collapsed. On the twenty-fifth day of the ninth month of this year, Mars shall trespass upon Taiwei, a sign of the sovereign losing his throne. The Chongzhen Emperor has issued a Penitential Edict to calm the people's hearts, yet the Great Ming is already lingering on its last breath. If my prediction is not wrong, within ten years at most, the Great Ming and the Chongzhen Emperor will certainly meet with unspeakable events!"

"What?" At these words, everyone paled in shock. One lost his voice: "Impossible! Our Emperor has reigned for eight years, staying away from music and women, diligent and fearful, exhausting his heart in governance. How could there be such an ending?" Before he finished, his mouth was covered by the person next to him. Someone groaned inwardly: This is seeking death! Where is "Our Emperor"? Your Emperor is the Great Song's Emperor!

Li Qiushui's face changed drastically, and he cupped his hands to Cui Hantang: "Brother Yang's words were unintentional, Daoist Master please do not blame..."

The others, reacting, also broke into a cold sweat, apologizing one after another—the Australians were also unhesitating when it came to killing!

Cui Hantang waved his hand to indicate no harm done, knowing it would be quite difficult to reverse their faith in a short time. A mocking look appeared at the corner of his mouth as he laughed: "'Our Emperor'? Haha, present-day Guangzhou is indeed my Great Song's territory. Fine, let's not talk of that. Speaking of when Chongzhen succeeded to the throne, the factionalism of officials was already formed, the resources of the wild consumed, the laws of the state broken, and the frontier chaos extreme. Though Chongzhen was determined to start anew and verify names and realities, regarding the worthiness of talent, the rights and wrongs of arguments, the merits of policies, and the success of military strategies, he could not perceive them clearly within, nor remain unswayed without. Moreover, his nature was suspicious and he relied on scrutiny; he preferred firmness and valued spirit. Relying on scrutiny leads to harshness and lack of grace; valuing spirit leads to haste and error. When bandits filled the mountains and the four directions boiled over, those entrusted with the handle of government were either mediocre or sycophantic, vacillating between suppression and appeasement with no fixed plan. Ministers inside and outside could not even save themselves from blame; everyone harbored a heart of seeking profit and self-preservation. Those whose speech was honest and straight, hitting the ills of the matter, were all broken and driven away. Those appointed as commanders had their authority checked from the center; merits could not compensate for faults. Defeat in one region meant the execution of a general; the fall of one city meant the killing of an official. Rewards and punishments were too excessive to the point where punishment was impossible; control was too strict to the point where control was impossible. Added to this were prevailing natural disasters, repeated famines, complex administration and heavy taxes, internal strife and external rebellion. Like a man's body, vital energy exhausted, ulcers and poisons breaking out together, the disease already critical, yet the doctors haphazardly administered medicine, mixing cold and heat indiscriminately—the disease entered the vitals, incurable. What could it wait for but destruction?"

Cui Hantang recited the final verdict on Chongzhen from the *History of Ming* in one breath. Seeing everyone dumbfounded and speechless, he knew he couldn't stimulate them too much.

So he immediately comforted them: "Gentlemen are all heroes of the time; you should know the principle that 'good birds choose wood to roost, wise ministers choose masters to serve.' The Ming state acts perversely, the living souls of the world are plunged into misery; the change in the current situation is not the fault of one man. Generally in worldly affairs, those involved are confused, while bystanders are clear. The Northern Barbarians have usurped and stolen the Central Plains for many years; their evil accumulates and disaster overflows, reaching a point of scorching rot. Moreover, the Ming state is benighted and deceitful, abandoned by Blue Heaven; the people are displaced, roving bandits cause calamity, government troops harm the people, starving corpses fill the wild. Generals defending against bandits are blamed at every turn, suffering *lingchi* execution, their heads hung in Gaojie. The selection of scholars must go through the Eight-Legged Essay, and officials must read the Four Books; consequently, the ministers holding power must be promoted through the Eight-Legged Essay. Yet their talent for governing the country is actually mediocre. The clear stream of the court must come from the Donglin; the Donglin's handling of affairs relies entirely on 'mouth cannons.' That the Ming state has reached the destruction of today is certainly not the crime of the ruler and ministers alone; it is caused by sticking to established rules without knowing flexibility."

"At this time, my Great Song receives the mandate from the Dao of Heaven, rising again in the South Sea, removing old governance, adapting to the times, instituting new policies, governing diligently with ambition for the world. All workers have remuneration for their labor, and the people have no worry of freezing or starving—who is superior and who is inferior is clear at a glance. Gentlemen having the heart to establish merit and careers, and the intention to benefit your native places, should forsake the dark and join the light, encouraging good plans early on—upwards to protect your families, downwards to preserve your lives, resolving the people's hanging distress, leaving a good name for a hundred generations. I have said my fill today; I hope you gentlemen ponder it carefully!"

Cui Hantang's barrage of "empty talk" clearly awed these scholars, each making a gesture of solemn instruction. It greatly satisfied Cui Hantang's vanity: he had once again painted a layer of "Heavenly Will" onto the Council of Elders and himself. The only regret was that the same "empty talk" hadn't had much effect in front of Li Suiqiu.

After the rest was finished, he continued his Daoist magic lecture. Cui Hantang was showing off exceptionally today. He first spoke a theory about exploring the Great Dao of Heaven and Earth, declaring that Daoism must not only cultivate the body and nature to find the true thusness of the original heart, called Cultivating Truth (Xiuzhen); but also study the supreme principles of the operation of heaven and earth, exploring the truth of the generation of all things, called Seeking the Dao. Cui Hantang declared that the all-knowing are all-powerful; the more supreme principles of heaven and earth a mortal knows, the greater the ability they master. If one mastered the supreme principles of heaven and earth, one could move mountains and fill seas, pluck stars and seize the moon. The reason the Council of Elders had such strength relied on their grasp of the Heavenly Dao.

"As the saying goes: 'The Dao of Heaven is constant; it does not exist for Yao, nor perish for Jie. Respond to it with order and it is auspicious; respond to it with disorder and it is ominous.' All of my Australian learning is the study and induction of the Dao of Heaven—this is also where the 'Dao' of our New Daoism lies." Cui Hantang concluded.

Seeing everyone's half-believing, half-doubting appearance, Cui Hantang simply performed a few magic tricks like lighting fire with a finger, igniting ice, and turning sunlight into rainbows. Everyone was somewhat startled, praising Daoist Priest Cui's profound magical power one after another.

"If it were a wandering Daoist from outside, he would inevitably claim this is his high magical power, but actually that is absurd!" Cui Hantang spoke with assurance. "These are actually the Heavenly Dao. I have merely glimpsed into it, able to learn and use it; it is not a theory of gods and spirits."
