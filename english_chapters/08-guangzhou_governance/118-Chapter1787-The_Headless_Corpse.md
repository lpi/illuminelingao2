# Chapter 1787 - The Headless Corpse

Having stumbled upon Advisor Gou's "good deed," Zhao Gui was not only beaten soundly by the Zhong family servants, but Master Zhong also laid down the word: he was never to come back for work.

Losing the job at the Zhong manor made his life even harder. Soon after, his old mother passed away, and Zhao Gui, having lost his only kin, felt incredibly lonely. However, the image of Sister Qiao pressed beneath Advisor Gou lingered in his mind. He thought: *Sister Qiao must have been forced. One day, I will rescue her from the clutches of Master Zhong and Advisor Gou.*

Now that Li Ziyu asked, he didn't want to bring up the past. He just walked with his head down, his mind full of Sister Qiao's silhouette, silently scratching his crotch again.

The sky gradually darkened. The curfew in Guangzhou had not yet been lifted, and since this was a residential area, there were absolutely no pedestrians on the street after dark. Only the monotonous "clack-clack" of their iron-studded shoes echoed on the stone road.

Li Ziyu instructed Zhao Gui to light a lantern, and they patrolled the street by its faint light.

Their patrol route was about 2.5 kilometers long, passing through several streets. One round took exactly just over an hour. At this time, although the street gates were locked, the patrolmen had keys to all the gates in their precinct and could open and close them as needed. Every time they opened a gate, Li Ziyu had to write the time in his logbook—patrolmen were issued a "Zhong's No. 6 Pocket Watch," large as a horse's hoof, when they went out, to strictly keep track of time. Especially when passing "check-in points," they had to record the passing time.

Night patrol was not only boring but also stressful. Guangzhou had no streetlights; if the moonlight was poor, walking was difficult, and the silent, dark environment put a lot of pressure on one's spirit.

"Pitch black, really scary." Zhao Gui was a bit worried. Walking on the empty street in this pitch-black night really made one's hair stand on end. "I'm scared... scared... scared..." He said "scared" several times but didn't dare utter the word "ghost."

"What are you scared of? There are people living in the houses on both sides." Although Li Ziyu was also a bit timid inside, he pretended to be carefree. "You haven't done anything guilty, don't fear... don't fear... *that thing* coming to knock on your door..."

A pair of green eyes suddenly darted past them. Caught off guard, Li Ziyu shivered all over. Focusing his eyes, he saw it was just a cat and breathed a sigh of relief. To cover up his composure, he shouted loudly, "Besides, we are officials on public duty. The batons we carry are sealed by the Senate's Imperial Standard; they can suppress a hundred evils..."

Just as he was spouting nonsense, his foot suddenly caught on something. Li Ziyu instantly tumbled to the ground. Zhao Gui stumbled too, nearly falling.

Li Ziyu fell dizzily. He managed to crawl up from the ground, picked up his hat, patted off the dust, and cursed, "What bad luck..." Before he finished speaking, he saw Zhao Gui trembling all over, the lantern in his hand shaking wildly. Just as Li Ziyu was about to scold him for not lighting the road properly, by the light of the lantern, he saw a corpse lying across the street!

Now it was Li Ziyu's turn to have his hair stand on end and tremble all over—the corpse was wrapped in coarse cloth, only roughly showing a human shape, but it had no head. A large patch of black blood had seeped out onto the white cloth.

Even though Li Ziyu was from a military household and had experienced dangers on the West River, having seen murder and arson, a headless corpse lying in the street on such a dark night... was gruesome enough.

He forced himself to calm down. While telling himself to be calm, he took the lantern from Zhao Gui and carefully shone it around. This place was the mouth of a branch alley. Li Ziyu peered in; the branch alley was dark and narrow, emitting a stench, but there was shimmering light at the very end.

Li Ziyu hardened his scalp, took off his baton, and told Zhao Gui to light the way in front. He intended to go in and take a look.

"Ah Yu, I think we shouldn't go in..." Zhao Gui suggested weakly.

"How can we report without inspecting it?" Li Ziyu said. "Let's go."

Helpless, Zhao Gui had to carry the lantern and walk inside. The ground in the branch alley wasn't paved; stepping down meant either soft mud or foot-stabbing broken bricks and tiles. The two walked with shallow and deep steps.

"Oh mother, this place is really scary..." Zhao Gui muttered, not daring to look back at the headless corpse on the road.

There were few residents in the branch alley. By the faint light, one could see they were poor families. The houses were low and simple, walls peeling to reveal the messy broken bricks inside. However, after walking a bit further, the wall on one side of the alley suddenly became a continuous brick wall, fully ten feet high. Li Ziyu was startled: this must be the back wall of a big household or a temple. Walking further, he indeed saw a small door in the wall. He went up and pushed it; it was locked.

He hadn't been interning long. Although the head of the *baojia* and the team leader of this precinct had taken him on a general tour, he was still unfamiliar with the area and couldn't recall whose back door this was.

After passing the small door and walking another ten steps or so, the sound of gurgling water came from ahead. It turned out the end of this branch alley was a river pier. The river water shimmered in the night, which was why they had seen the flickering light from the alley mouth.

Li Ziyu looked around the river pier. There were only a few small Dan household boats moored on the river channel, no lights, no sound. No suspicious clues.

"Let's hurry back and report," Li Ziyu said.

Zhao Gui couldn't wait for him to say that and quickly said, "Good, good."

The two came back out of the branch alley. But reporting wasn't easy. There were no telephones for the police in Guangzhou City. To report, they had to return to the police station, and then the station would send a messenger to report to the Criminal Investigation Division at the Bureau.

Of course, they carried signal rockets, but those could only be used in case of riots or emergencies.

"Zhao Gui, you watch here. I'll go to the station..." Li Ziyu had just said this when Zhao Gui was scared out of his wits, grabbing his arm. "Ah Yu, don't, don't, don't leave me... I'll go back with you."

"If we both go back, what about the scene?" Li Ziyu remembered the standard procedures in the "Criminal Case Handling Regulations" he had memorized; sending someone to guard the scene to prevent evidence destruction was a basic requirement.

However, Zhao Gui refused to stay alone to watch the corpse no matter what. Li Ziyu wasn't willing to stay here guarding it either. Just as they were deadlocked, Li Ziyu suddenly thought that the watchman's hut wasn't far away. He could go call the watchman to come keep Zhao Gui company and boost his courage.

So the two turned back together. The watchman's hut was only two or three hundred steps away. A fine rain began to fall from the sky, pitch black. Zhao Gui hurriedly took out oil-paper covers to shield them. Nervous and flustered, the two spent several minutes just getting the rain covers on. The lantern's light grew even dimmer.

However, when they returned to the street gate, the watchman wasn't in the hut—he was out beating the watches. They hurriedly searched and spent quite a while finding him. Li Ziyu then remembered he hadn't even recorded the time he found the corpse. He quickly took out his "pocket watch." Checking it by lantern light, it was just past 1 AM, about the beginning of the *Zi* hour. He figured that with all the tossing about, the time of discovery must have been just past 12 AM.

The three hurried back. However, when they arrived at the alley mouth, Li Ziyu and Zhao Gui were shocked: the corpse was gone!

When they left just now, the corpse was lying on the ground. Now, there was nothing. Li Ziyu snatched the lantern and brought it close to the ground; nothing remained.

Zhao Gui's face was pale as a sheet, stammering, "Heavenly Bodhisattva! This, this, but it was a headless corpse..."

When he said this, the watchman got scared too. "Could it be... could it be a zombie reanimating?"

Li Ziyu stood there dumbfounded, his brain a mess of paste. A headless corpse was definitely right here just now; where did it go in such a short time? He didn't quite believe in things like reanimating corpses. Obviously, someone had moved the corpse. But they had walked all the way here and seen not even a ghost's shadow—where did the person come from?

The three searched around randomly again but found nothing. Seeing the rain getting heavier, Li Ziyu was at a loss for a moment: if he went back to report, how could he explain having no corpse? If he didn't report, the headless corpse was something he and Zhao Gui had witnessed with their own eyes—he had even tripped over it, and his knee was still aching faintly.

The watchman, seeing no corpse found, actually sighed in relief and laughed, "Since there's no corpse, there's no matter! Saved a piece of official business. Saved so much trouble."

Zhao Gui stammered, "But, but, just now it was truly a corpse, without a head."

The watchman looked at Zhao Gui with a face full of disdain and said, "Sir Officer, human life cases always require seeing the person alive or the corpse dead. Since there's no corpse, there's no case. Why meddle? Not to mention there isn't even a plaintiff here, even if there were, without finding the corpse, which official would accept the complaint? Besides, with hundreds of thousands of people in Guangzhou, not a day goes by without a hundred people dying. One more isn't too many, one less isn't too few." He smiled. "It's dark and raining; maybe the two officers saw wrong. This humble one will pretend I heard nothing and saw nothing." With that, he bowed and went off to beat his watch, minding his own business.

The rain grew denser. Only Li Ziyu and Zhao Gui remained on the street, not knowing what to say. Li Ziyu clenched his fist. He knew the watchman made sense. But while studying at the Palace of Ten Thousand Longevities, the Australians had instilled another set of concepts in them: they were police, responsible for maintaining social stability and "protecting the peace of the realm"—Li Ziyu felt most truly what "social stability" and "peace of the realm" meant.

Just now, there was truly a corpse lying on the ground, headless—a person dying on the road wouldn't cut off their own head; this person must have been murdered! The rain beat against his face, and the scene of his uncle's family being slaughtered by robbers on the West River floated into his heart again. He suddenly made up his mind and said to Zhao Gui, "Go! We're going back to report immediately!"
