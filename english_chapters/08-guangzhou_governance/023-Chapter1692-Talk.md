# Chapter 1692 - Talk

Entering the courtyard, he saw Old Lady Cao had already been placed on a door plank. Several people were surrounding her, and a guard was performing CPR. Yun Suji asked, "How is she?"

The captain of the guards said, "She's been brought back, that was close!"

"When was she discovered?"

"Just a short while ago," the guard captain said with lingering fear. "There wasn't a sound! If not for you saying to check every hour, Chief, she would probably be stiff by tomorrow morning!"

Hearing she wasn't dead, color finally returned to Fan Twelve's face.

Yun Suji nodded. At this time, a woman came in and brought a bowl of ginger soup to pour down Old Lady Cao's throat. Seeing her face turn red, verifying she had likely caught her breath, he ordered people to carry her to the side room to lie down first, and told two women to watch over her.

Old Lady Cao wanted the "fish to die and the net to break." Yun Suji lit a cigarette. He wasn't too surprised. In the old times, this was a common practice: hanging oneself directly at the enemy's door to ruin their family—the government didn't care about suicide or homicide; customarily, whoever's door someone died at was treated as the murderer or suspect. Even if the injustice could be washed away in the end, it would still result in a ruined body and a broken family.

Even in 20th century rural China, it wasn't news for women to barge into an "adversary's" home and drink pesticide due to various disputes. Even trivial matters like sulking or quarreling with family members could induce women to commit suicide. In surveys of suicide populations in China, the suicide rate of rural women was the highest.

This is a rhythm to make Fan Twelve, Liu Yuanhu, and this bunch look bad, Yun Suji thought. He said to Fan Twelve, who had followed him in trembling all the way, "Go call Han Daoguo and Liu Yuanhu here. I have words to ask."

Fan Twelve responded and was about to go out when Yun Suji stopped him again: "Call Liu Yuanhu's wife over too."

Seeing Fan Twelve leave as if he had lost his soul, the captain of the guards asked, "Chief, should I call someone to accompany him?"

Yun Suji shook his head: "If he runs, there's nothing left to ask; he must have a guilty conscience." He instructed the guard captain to guard Old Lady Cao's door and not allow her to come out and make a fuss.

A while later, Fan Twelve indeed called everyone together. Yun Suji instructed them to be called in one by one for questioning. He was extremely familiar with grassroots work; within a few words, he would know if there were any abuses and if the cadres were telling the truth.

From his visits and symposiums throughout the day today, Borang Village didn't have big problems, but a heap of small problems. To use a cliché: "The general direction is good." As for village cadres eating and taking more, asking villagers to work for them, and being rude or beating and scolding villagers, these were not considered major issues at the current stage.

Yun Suji believed that the simplest things to see the administrative ability of grassroots cadres were only two things: people's livelihood and infrastructure. Whether grassroots cadres were dedicated and what their abilities were like could be seen from these. From these two points, Borang Village was doing quite well.

The county indeed provided certain financial support for the infrastructure construction of model villages, but the bulk still depended on the villagers investing labor and materials themselves. If village cadres didn't have a certain appeal and work ability, it would be impossible to accomplish all this.

As for anti-foot-binding and improving environmental hygiene, they didn't count as major livelihood issues of solving food and clothing, but they were genuinely related to people's livelihood. They were also important standards for testing whether cadres were attentive to their work.

Therefore, he didn't dwell too much on the details of village administration, but asked clearly about Old Lady Cao's matter alone. He asked Fan Twelve, "I know you came back from Shandong with Senator Lu and are an old naturalized citizen who has stood the test. Give me the bottom line: what exactly is going on with the pension of Old Lady Cao's son? Old Lady Cao has been saying she didn't receive it; did she receive it or not?"

Fan Twelve said, "Chief! Heaven and earth serve as conscience regarding this pension matter! We didn't embezzle her money. after her son had the accident, the pension was indeed collected by Yuanhu, and when it arrived in the village, it was entered into the official public account. This is all recorded in black and white..."

Yun Suji said, "Since the money was collected, why wasn't it distributed to her but entered into the village's public account?"

Fan Twelve swallowed a mouthful of saliva. Old Lady Cao's pension had long been spent. Fortunately, they had discussed this matter long ago, and Han Daoguo had found a policy basis back then. So he wasn't too nervous: "There's a reason here. Old Lady Cao lost her son and has no grandchildren—this makes her a heirless household. According to the 'Civil Affairs' document issued to us by the county, this is called a 'social security household without descendants,' and it falls to the village to support her." As he spoke, he rummaged for a while and found a crumpled document with a red header from the cabinet, saying that according to the meaning in the document, the land of heirless households was uniformly managed by the village, which would recruit people to substitute farm. The pension was managed by the village and reserved for major expenses.

Yun Suji took it and looked. The red-headed document was real. The parts about land substitute farming and pension trusteeship inside were also not fake, but there was a word "may" in the clause about the pension being managed by the village. In other words, handing it over to the village for management wasn't a mandatory regulation.

Yun Suji's heart was clear as snow; Fan Twelve and the others were "eating the heirless household." Let alone the Ming Dynasty in the 17th century, this was common even in rural China in the 21st century. A word "may" in a document could become a masterpiece of writing. For villagers who were basically illiterate or semi-illiterate, how could they understand the subtleties within? But this wasn't even the bottom line—Fan Twelve and his group were at least exploiting policy loopholes and playing word games, showing somewhat of a "spirit of the rule of law."

"Your definition of heirless is a bit forced; the Cao family still has a daughter-in-law. You surely know about recruiting a husband to support the parents-in-law." Yun Suji shook his head. "This is one thing. Secondly, Old Lady Cao and Gaifeng have a share in the pension; her share should be distributed to her."

Fan Twelve had never dreamed that the daughter-in-law would also count for a share. When Yun Suji said this, he panicked a bit and hurriedly said, "Yes, yes, we didn't grasp the policy accurately."

"As for this heirless issue, I won't haggle with you too much." Yun Suji said, "Gaifeng has remarried now, so the matter of recruiting a husband to support the parents-in-law won't be discussed."

"I'll arrange to distribute Gaifeng's share to her tomorrow..."

"You must issue Old Lady Cao's money too! If you don't know what the word 'may' means, ask Han Daoguo to explain it to you." Yun Suji smiled faintly, then said seriously, "In addition, the rice given to social security households by substitute farmers is too little now. 400 jin per person, that's only enough for rations," Yun Suji said slowly. "People still need to wear clothes. Even if there are vegetables in their own fields, they still have to buy salt; families with small children also need to eat some fish and meat... The substitute farmers are taking too much advantage. The benefits in taxes alone are endless, don't you say?"

Fan Twelve was startled, knowing his little tricks couldn't be hidden, and hurriedly said, "Yes, yes."

"Go call Gaifeng here."

"Yes, I'll go right now!"

Not long after, Fan Twelve called Gaifeng in. Yun Suji saw she was about twenty-five or twenty-six years old, wearing an indigo tie-dyed Indian cotton small jacket, tidy and clean. Her appearance was nothing extraordinary; although her complexion was dark, her skin was full and lustrous, with a rosy flush on her face. It seemed she was living not a bad life with Liu Yuanhu.

Yun Suji noticed she walked with a slight limp. Upon entering the room, she curtsied first, called out "Chief," and then lowered her head and remained silent. Yun Suji saw tear stains still at the corners of her eyes, thinking that with Old Lady Cao's fuss, she couldn't have peace either.

His heart felt great pity for the suffering she had endured, so he said pleasantly:

"You are Gaifeng?"

"Yes, this servant is."

"What is your maiden surname?"

Gaifeng looked up at him, then lowered her head and said, "This servant's parents died early, I don't know what the surname is. My husband's family is surnamed Liu."

"Were you Old Lady Cao's daughter-in-law before?"

Hearing this, Gaifeng's body trembled; she whispered, "Yes."

"How did they treat you?"

Gaifeng kept her head down. Although Yun Suji couldn't see her expression, he could tell from her slightly trembling shoulders that her heart was surging with waves. After a long while, he heard her whisper, "There was always a mouthful of rice to eat."

He asked again, "You are husband and wife with Liu Yuanhu now; how does he treat you?"

Gaifeng answered almost immediately, "Treats me well! I'm willing to follow him." She seemed afraid that Yun Suji would drag her back into a relationship with her former husband's family, and added, "Whether it's eating chaff and swallowing vegetables or being beaten and scolded, I'm willing. Even if he sits in jail, I'll deliver meals to him and wait for him to come out!"

Yun Suji now completely understood that what Old Yang's wife said was the truth. However, he was a bit strange; why would she mention "sitting in jail"? So he smiled and said, "Who said he's going to sit in jail?"

"Ever since you entered the village, people have been saying so," Gaifeng whispered.

"Your husband hasn't committed a crime; why would he sit in jail?"

Gaifeng looked up at him, then lowered her head and said, "He's a petty official, there are always times when he does things wrong. He's usually fierce to the villagers too. Village Head Fan just uses him as a club; if something really happens, won't everyone push the falling wall?"

Yun Suji nodded and said, "You are quite knowledgeable."

"This servant dares not."

"Liu Yuanhu, this person, has some problems with his work methods, but his work is still done very well." Yun Suji said, "Sitting in jail and such are rumors; there's no such thing."

"Yes, thank you, Blue Sky Lord..." Gaifeng was already shedding tears rolling down.

"What happened to your foot? Did Liu Yuanhu whip your bottom?"

Gaifeng shook her head and said indifferently, "This is left over from before. Lying on the bench, four or five bamboo strips were broken. That night I crawled onto the炕 [kang/bed]."

Yun Suji felt very sympathetic in his heart and said, "I've investigated the matter of your former husband's pension clearly. It's wrong for the village to detain it and not release it. It will be issued tomorrow! Logically, you should have a share too..."

Gaifeng shook her head and said, "I don't want this money."

"This is your former husband's pension. You were husband and wife with him after all; emotionally and reasonably, you deserve it..."

Gaifeng said resolutely, "I won't touch his family's things, whether dead or alive. Whoever covets it can take it; I don't want a single copper."

Yun Suji nodded secretly; this woman was quite distinct. He said, "You go out, call Liu Yuanhu in."
