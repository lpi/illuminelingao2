# Chapter 2023 - Meritorious Participation (II)

"That's easy, I'll go contact them." Fu Meng volunteered. He wasn't as much of a "homebody" as Cui Hantang, who was content to stay in the temple working on "infrastructure."

"Mm, you handle this then. Each one must give at least one hundred yuan."

"One hundred is already a lot, and you say 'at least'?" Although Fu Meng had little affection for the other two groups, he was still reluctant about this blatant extortion routine.

The purchasing power of the silver yuan notes they issued was quite substantial. A table at a Guangzhou restaurant with chicken, duck, fish, and meat—an eight-treasure feast that eight men couldn't finish—cost only two yuan. One hundred yuan was a small fortune.

"It is a lot, but the expenses are huge." Cui Hantang felt Fu Meng was good in every way, except his little sense of justice sometimes left him helpless. "Don't forget the house repairs are also on us..."

Cui Hantang had actively taken on the temporary bridal chamber issue precisely to play the "borrow chicken to lay eggs" trick. Unexpectedly, Ai Zhixin refused to pay for repairs, ruining his first plan; coincidentally a new pretext appeared, naturally not to be missed.

Gathering money from the Three Religions to repair houses for my New Daoism—isn't it wonderful. Thinking of this, Cui Hantang felt quite pleased with himself.

Fu Meng went to "contact work." Cui Hantang estimated this alms-begging trip wouldn't be difficult. Fu Meng was a dignified Elder; asking in the name of the Wedding and Funeral Council, neither Buddhism nor Catholicism would refuse him face. Especially the Buddhist Association Chairman and Abbot of Guangxiao Temple, Tongjiong, was a very sensible person who cooperated well with the Religious Affairs Office. It was that smelly new Guangzhou Bishop Ma Yangchun who often showed expressions of "disapproval" in meetings. Cui Hantang always felt this German had an inexplicable sense of superiority.

Raising money from these two was easy; next was how to mobilize wealthy households for "meritorious participation."

Although Daoist rituals had many names—dispelling disaster, praying for blessings, seeking peace, salvation were all valid reasons—no one had ever held a "Marriage Jiao," nor were there ready-made rituals or scriptures. Cui Hantang scratched his head for a long time without knowing how to perform this Marriage Jiao. Then he thought, I'm the head of a temple, why worry about this? He immediately told Qing Yun to call Daoist Hou (Thick/Honest Daoist).

Since returning to Five Immortals Temple, Daoist Hou had been very diligent. His "professional ability" was the best among the retained Daoists, so he handled most of the temple's "traditional business." Matters like holding rituals naturally fell to him.

Hearing about holding a Marriage Jiao, Daoist Hou was surprised, wondering what kind of ritual this was. No patriarch of any sect had such a ritual. Besides, what scriptures to chant? How to write the memorial? He was full of disapproval, but facing this fat Daoist master, Daoist Hou naturally dared not say "don't know." But asking him to invent a "Marriage Jiao" ritual and scriptures out of thin air—he didn't have that ability either.

Daoist Hou thought repeatedly and said: "Daoist Master, regarding this Marriage Jiao, forgive this humble Daoist's ignorance, but I've never learned it. If such a ritual is needed, in my humble opinion, better to hold a Blessing Jiao. Write on the memorial that it is to pray for blessings for newlyweds; that would be appropriate."

Cui Hantang heard this made sense, nodded repeatedly, and said: "In that case, you handle this matter. This is arranged by the Guangzhou Municipal Government, to be held for three consecutive days. Many distinguished guests will be entertained for meritorious participation; you must arrange everything properly."

"I obey the Dharma decree." Daoist Hou hurriedly bowed.

Under the New Daoism system, there was no such thing as "Dharma decree." But flattery always works. Daoist Hou's flattery was quite well-received by Cui Hantang.

Daoist Hou withdrew to prepare. Cui Hantang then summoned the temple's reception monk (Zhike)—this Zhike was originally an old hand at Five Immortals Temple. After the temple was "taken over," Daoists scattered, and he fled to a Daoist courtyard outside the city. Being a Zhike and not an ordinary Daoist, the abbot there valued him highly. But a small temple inevitably felt like a waste of talent. Later hearing the Great Song's new abbot summoned everyone back, he returned. Cui Hantang was delighted to see the Zhike return and immediately reinstated him.

Responsible for receiving pilgrims, a Zhike played a pivotal role in any temple. "Donors" were not only a main economic source but having a few "big thresholds" to rely on also saved much trouble. Thus, temples of any scale valued the choice of Zhike highly. especially for a large and famous temple like Five Immortals Temple, the Zhike had to be diplomatic and know the family situations of city gentry and wealthy households like the back of his hand.

Cui Hantang wanted the Zhike to go out these few days, ostensibly to "distribute blessings," visiting gentry and wealthy households associated with Five Immortals Temple one by one, informing them that the temple would soon hold a "Marriage Jiao" for the collective wedding hosted by the Guangzhou Municipal Government.

"...You don't need to explicitly ask them to participate, just mention the matter." Cui Hantang instructed. "If asked who is holding the ritual, say it is Zhang Yu, boss of Zhang's Food Company."

The Zhike nodded: "This humble Daoist understands."

"Some gentry and wealthy households need not be visited." Cui Hantang instructed. "You know which ones."

"Yes, this humble Daoist understands." The Zhike understood perfectly. shortly after his return, Cui Hantang gave him a list, telling him to reduce interactions with the wealthy households on it. Being a person "with one more heart orifice than Bi Gan," he naturally understood this was the Council of Elders' "Roll Call of Doom"—households on it had worrying prospects. However, occasionally this list would be modified, with households added or deleted.

"Good, go ahead." Cui Hantang leaned back on the bamboo couch. "If they want to participate, register them and bring it back for me to see."

"Visiting one by one like this will take about two or three days. When is the ritual scheduled?"

Cui Hantang avoided the question: "The date isn't set yet; just handle this first."

"Then this humble Daoist will go tomorrow."

Watching the Zhike leave, Cui Hantang thought about how he had arranged everything in just an hour and could now sit back and enjoy the fruits. He felt smug: all abilities are fake, leadership skills are real!

The next day, Cui Hantang got up early—though lazy, he didn't sleep in. Rising at 5 AM was an old habit from the old timeline. He didn't eat breakfast after washing, drinking a cup of warm water first, then changed into Daoist robes served by Xiao Qian.

Qing Yun came to report: the audience had assembled.

"Good, let's go exercise!"

As soon as the sky brightened, people gathered in front of Five Immortals Temple to watch this "Australian Spectacle." Seeing the temple gate open, a stir ran through the crowd: "Coming," "Coming."

A group of blue-robed Daoists emerged from the opening gate, led by the Australian fat abbot, filing out with about thirty people. There were both men and women. They formed six rows on the small square in front of the temple, five per row. The fat abbot stood opposite the formation and shouted: "Center on Qing Yun, spread out in gymnastics formation!" A young Daoist in the middle raised his hand high, and other Daoists spread arms to space themselves out, two arm-lengths apart front, back, left, and right. The fat Daoist shouted again: "Warm up!" Daoists interlaced fingers and rotated wrists in place, alternating ankle rotations, then stretching arms and pressing legs...

After a set of warm-up exercises, the fat Daoist shouted again: "Five-Step Fist, ready, begin!" Saying so, the fat Daoist turned and led the practice, young Daoists following his commands and movements:

Parallel Stance Fist Hold, Bow Stance Punch, Snap Kick Punch, Horse Stance Block Strike, Cross Stance Punch, Knee Raise Palm Pierce, Drop Stance Palm Pierce, Empty Stance Palm Strike, Parallel Stance Fist Hold.

After doing Five-Step Fist three times, the fat Daoist changed commands: "Tai Chi Thirteen Forms," ready, begin:

Immortal Points Sword, Universe Ball Hold, Beauty Looks in Mirror...

By now the watching crowd was buzzing: "What are these Daoists doing?" "Practicing martial arts for show?" "Not afraid of people stealing skills?" Bold children were already imitating the punches and kicks.

For regulars, this wasn't fresh at all. They came every day partly with ideas of "stealing skills."

Cui Hantang practicing Tai Chi early every morning these days was actually to gather popularity. Seeing more people watching every morning, he felt the time was right. After the final form "True Qi Refines Elixir," he didn't dismiss the group but walked around the small square with composure, saying:

"Respected neighbors, life lies in movement. This fist set is named: Tai Chi Thirteen Forms. Created by Patriarch Sanfeng, the Thirteen Postures consist of thirteen groups of movements with strong offensive and defensive intent, including Opening, Ball Holding, Single Push, Probe, lift, Pounce, Carry, Separate, Cloud, Dissolve, Double Push, Lower, and Closing. It contains three Daoist internal cultivation methods: Tu Na (breathing), Daoyin (guiding), and Cai Bu Hun Yuan Zhuang (Gathering Primordial Stance). The movements are designed according to the needs of exercising the human body's eight meridians, which connect internally to the five organs. The entire routine contains the five organs and eight meridians internally, and five steps and eight methods externally, combining defense and offense, fusing Daoist health-preserving alchemy, hence called 'Tai Chi Thirteen Postures.' It is truly the orthodox way of health preservation, the essence of Tai Chi. Frequent practice can strengthen the body and prolong life. Now teaching here for free; every morning we Daoists practice outside the gate for half an hour. Those willing to learn can observe and practice on their own. This health-preserving secret method is taught by fate; how much you learn depends on everyone's comprehension."

Having finished speaking, Cui Hantang led the young Daoists to practice on their own to the music of *Cloud Water Zen Heart* from inside the temple.

After finishing this morning ritual, an hour had passed. The Daoists were starving with stars in their eyes and cold sweat on their backs, especially the retained old Daoists whose physical fitness was inferior to the students. Practicing early without eating, they were almost hypoglycemic. Fortunately, Cui Hantang treated people generously, and the food was excellent. Upon returning to the dining hall, duty Daoists served bowls of thick rice porridge, with jars of brown sugar on the table to sweeten to taste. There were also fried dough sticks (youtiao).
