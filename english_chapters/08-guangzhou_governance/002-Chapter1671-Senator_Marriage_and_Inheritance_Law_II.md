# Chapter 1671 - Senator Marriage and Inheritance Law (II)

Servings others with beauty cannot last long, not to mention that most of the early Life Secretaries could hardly be called "beautiful." As the Senate continued to grow and strengthen, the resource of maids became increasingly abundant and the quality improved significantly. With the added competition from female students of Fangcaodi and young ladies from wealthy families across East Asia, the status of early Life Secretaries in the family became precarious.

Although Senators had "developed feelings over time" for their first maids and mostly had a deep emotional foundation, this did not prevent them from disliking the first generation of Life Secretaries for "not being good-looking," "low birth," or "uneducated." Du Wen had once proposed that the relationship between Senators and their first Life Secretaries should be regarded as "de facto marriage," but this was voted down by a large margin—Senators were calculating to choose a formal wife from Fangcaodi female students who had received a full set of new-style education or from daughters of prominent and wealthy families on the mainland. Only a few Senators, such as Wu Nanhai and Wu De, truly married their Life Secretaries as legal wives.

Most Life Secretaries also had this realization, knowing they could not enjoy the status of a "legal wife." Children became the only guarantee for their own status and future. For the latecomers among Life Secretaries, lacking the advantage of being the "original partner," they had to rely on their own offspring to improve their status in the family; thus, without exception, Life Secretaries treated children as "protective talismans," and pampering and spoiling them was a very common phenomenon. For Life Secretaries who gave birth to boys, it was natural to use their children's "first-mover advantage" to try to covet the "Senator seat."

Ji Xin knew that currently, Senators had few offspring, mostly only one or two children, and not many Life Secretaries. Once the Mainland Campaign unfolded, there would be a bumper harvest of both wives and children. If rules were not set now, domestic disputes might lead to bloodshed later.

In the "Senator Marriage and Inheritance Law," a Senator's spouse could have two types of relationships: "legal marriage" and "de facto cohabitation." The legal status of the two was different. The conclusion or divorce of the former required formal procedures, recognized by the Senate Court of Honor and issued with relevant certificates; the latter required no legal procedures, only filing with the General Office.

If a Senator's spouse was another Senator, regardless of timing, it was always a "legal marriage."

Senator spouses were not restricted by gender. Female Senators, if they wished, could also keep multiple male "Life Secretaries." If someone was homosexual, the Senate would equally acknowledge the legal status of their spouse.

A spouse under legal marriage was a husband or wife recognized by Senate law, enjoying all titles and rights of a formal spouse, and possessing priority in inheritance after the Senator's death; those in de facto cohabitation enjoyed none of this. Whether they could inherit and what share they could inherit was decided by the Senator's will or the executor of the will.

This was effectively a disguised distinction between "primary wife and concubine," tantamount to acknowledging the unequal relationship between "legal wife" and "concubine" in legal form. Consequently, it met resolute opposition from a small number of Senators led by Du Wen during the draft stage, who considered it serious "reactionary" regression. However, the Law Society, which drafted the bill, reminded everyone that at least in the legal sense, Senators did not have "concubines."

"Whether it is a big step or a small step, it is a step we take in the history of human civilization." Ji Xin painstakingly persuaded the opponents at the meeting. Although proportionally, the opposition was few, Ji Xin, with an attitude of "my heart is open to the sun and moon," gave a full explanation, "Comrade Du Wen, I understand your feelings and agree with your ideals, but our current situation makes it impossible to fully realize your ideas. Rather than holding on to principles and gaining nothing, it is better to lower our posture to achieve the goal incrementally..."

Spouses had different legal statuses, but children had equal status. The Marriage and Inheritance Law stipulated that as long as a Senator's child was registered with the General Office's Heraldry Court, whether legitimate, illegitimate, or adopted, they enjoyed equal legal status. There was no limit on Senators adopting children. Adopted children could also be designated to inherit the Senator seat—restricted to cases where there were no biological children or biological children were incapable of inheriting.

However, how the Senator's seat was inherited—whether by "merit" or by "seniority" or other methods—was decided by the Senator individually. Legally, all legitimate children of a Senator were eligible to inherit, regardless of gender or mother's background. However, children whose mother was a female Senator had priority inheritance rights.

During their lifetime, a Senator must seal their choice of inheritance method or list of heirs and submit it to the General Office's Heraldry Court for secret storage in the presence of a third-party witness. Together with the will, it would be opened and read under the supervision of the Senate Funeral Committee after death. Once read, it was established, and no one could object.

For Senators who made no inheritance arrangements, their seat after death would have a designated heir arranged by the Senate. The principle was "primogeniture." If there were no children or the children's physical condition clearly prevented them from inheriting the Senator seat, the Senate would arrange for the adoption of another Senator's child to inherit the seat.

As for a Senator's property, apart from shares that would be nationalized after death as stipulated in the Common Program, property owned by the Senate such as houses, vehicles, and high-end furniture would be reclaimed by the General Office. The remaining personal portion would be distributed according to the Senator's will. Without a will, the Senate would preside over the distribution. In principle, the person inheriting the Senator seat would be the primary heir.

This marriage and inheritance system largely balanced the opinions of Senators from all sides, so there was less controversy. However, some proposed a "one-size-fits-all" adoption of "primogeniture" to facilitate the stability of Senator families.

"...The so-called 'appointing the worthy' is tantamount to raising Gu (venomous insects). It's fine if there are few children, but if a Senator has five or six or more children—which I think is very likely—a 'Palace Intrigue' drama for the seat will definitely be staged. How to demonstrate one's 'worthiness'? Senator children will surely show off their abilities, and various tricks of framing and planting evidence will probably not be lacking. Maybe poisoning and drugging will all be there...

"Whether one is a Senator or not—this distinction between high and low is truly the difference between clouds and mud! Under our system, the Senate is the Emperor, and a Senator is equivalent to an emperor. Since ancient times, there have been many examples of fathers and sons, brothers killing each other for the throne. We should learn from the European practice, clearly stating that the eldest legitimate son takes all. This can cut off other children's fight for the seat, making them turn their eyes to the outside world as soon as possible instead of staring at their own family's seat, which is conducive to reducing internal friction."

"Is 'winner-takes-all for the eldest son' useful?" Wu Nanhai was a staunch supporter of the "merit faction." "Everyone gangs up to frame the Crown Prince, bring him down, and then tear each other apart—such things are not unheard of. Or simply the second son murders the eldest, the concubine's son murders the legitimate son... We Chinese don't have a nobility complex; we believe 'Are kings and geneals born of a special breed?' The primogeniture system doesn't have such magical effects. In my opinion, let them raise Gu. Anyway, the ultimate winner will definitely not be a weakling, much stronger than a useless eldest son. Besides, what we are implementing now is equivalent to a secret storage system for heir designation, which can curb the internal fighting of Senator children."

"I think we should provide enough security for Senator children to reduce conflicts," someone suggested. "What if Senator children don't get an inheritance or only get a very small share? They will have a strong sense of loss and might become unstable factors. The Senate Foundation should have special arrangements for these Senator children, allocating special funds to provide housing and allowances, ensuring they can all live a comfortable life..."

"Wouldn't that make them into Eight Banner bannermen!" Wu Nanhai expressed strong opposition. "This is harming them! Besides, if you want to provide a comfortable life guarantee for Senators' children, what about Senators' grandchildren? This population increase would be geometric! That would be truly 'too big to fail' (tail too big to wag)!"

Ma Jia coughed: "I also think we cannot artificially create a 'Senator Clan'—the consequences would be unimaginable. For Senators' children, the Senate treats them equally and provides the best education. They can also inherit some property themselves—if he is still a loser (diaosi) like this, then there is no need for the Senate to pay more attention to him."

In the end, the primogeniture system did not receive more response, and it followed the original clause of "Senator decides personally."

To further reduce the possibility of "Palace Intrigue" among Senator children, curb the involvement of mothers, and reduce interference from concepts of this spacetime, the "Marriage and Inheritance Law" stipulated that all Senator children must be sent to the Kindergarten attached to the Academy after the age of three, and enter the Academy Primary School after the age of six, adopting a fully boarding system. Except for rest days and holidays when they go home, they must live a collective life at school.

In the final stage of deliberation, someone raised the issue of inheritance of seats for elderly Senators. Since adopted children could also inherit Senator seats, even elderly Senators who physically no longer had reproductive conditions could use this clause to pass on the Senator seat by adopting children. For example, they could completely pass their seat down by adopting grandchildren without "letting it go cheaply to outsiders."

If it was said separately that the seats of elderly Senators could not be inherited, this would violate the spirit of equality among Senators. After a heated discussion, it was finally decided to recognize that elderly Senators had the right to adopt heirs and pass on seats, but cross-generation adoption was not allowed. That is, they could either adopt other Senators' children or adopt naturalized citizens. In addition, it was stipulated that the adopted child's surname must follow the Senator's original surname and could not follow the husband's surname. The age of the adopted child could not be older than three years.

"A sixty-something auntie adopting a child under three, this is the rhythm to kill her..." someone couldn't help complaining.

"There are plenty of sixty-year-old elderly people raising children. Besides, Senators can use wet nurses and nannies; this is not an issue." Ma Jia said leisurely, "Limiting the child's age is to minimize the affection between the adopted child and biological parents." At the same time, in order to prevent certain Senators from using "sending children for adoption" as a way to expand family power, it was explicitly proposed that a Senator could send only one child for adoption.
