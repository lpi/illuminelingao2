# Chapter 1677 - Lingao-Chengmai-Qiongshan

The large areas of wasteland on both banks of the Nandu River also attracted the agricultural sector to establish plantations.

"This time, I plan to investigate Haikou to plan well for the construction of the first demonstrative farm in northern Hainan."

Wu Nanhai nodded: "Then let Dugu Qiuhun go with you. He told me he wanted to go to Wenchang, focusing on the first batch of immigrants allocated to the agricultural sector, to select a batch of future employees."

Dugu Qiuhun did barefoot rice transplanting by day and dreamed of washing his feet to go ashore by night. If the agricultural sector built a state farm system, there would be people and territory, and it would naturally be a steel fortress of the planned economy, coinciding significantly with the political spectrum of that certain person he supported. Naturally, it would be a thoroughfare for upward mobility. Therefore, he was full of drive for this and was a capable hand at "running for the ministry."

These two knew Dugu Qiuhun's intentions clearly but didn't point it out: after all, what he did was beneficial to the department.

As the sun was just dawning on this day, Yun Suji and Dugu Qiuhun set off from Lingao mightily with four carriages. By the time the sun was three poles high, they were already resting at the Chengmai County courier station.

After the victory of the Lingao Defense War, as part of the "Grand Cross Road" transportation plan, the Transportation Department organized a POW brigade investing over three thousand laborers. Taking two months, following the alignment of the Hainan West Line Expressway in the old spacetime, they completed the construction of the cinder and gravel road from Chengmai to Qiongzhou Prefecture. The courier stations along the way were all renovated, and phoenix trees (Delonix regia) were planted on both sides of the road. In the old spacetime, phoenix trees were tall, with crowns spreading horizontally and drooping, dense and broad to catch the wind, playing the role of shade trees in tropical areas. In the new spacetime, phoenix trees were also selected by the transportation department as tropical roadside trees, growing lushly on both sides of roads in Lingao, Sanya, and other places.

Now there was new scenery by the roadside: black telegraph poles had been erected. The first phase of the round-island wired telegraph project was roughly completed. Wired telegraph from Lingao to the west had already connected Chengmai, Qiongshan, and Wenchang.

Along the way, Yun Suji saw harvested farmland everywhere. Now the fields were planted with paddy green manure: Chinese milk vetch (Astragalus sinicus). Looking as far as the eye could see, there were already dots of green. Out of the keen observation of a long-time frontline agricultural technician, he noticed at a glance that the number of farmers in the fields was significantly low.

"Good men don't earn money in June (slack season)," he said secretly.

This was a colloquial saying. Although it wasn't June now, the busy autumn harvest and autumn planting season had passed. Farmers had stored every grain and began the slack farming season; very few people went to the fields. In the past, Yun Suji mocked Southeast Asian natives for idling all day and not working. He originally thought this folk saying was just lip service—who would leave money unearned? But these two or three years in Hainan made him feel the pure gold truth contained in this sentence.

In the year the Senate just landed, villagers saw money like mosquitoes seeing blood; under heavy rewards, various construction speeds broke records repeatedly. However, with the help of the Tiandihui, after rural life initially improved, many people became satisfied with small wealth. Although the future "Old Dad Tea" had not yet been spawned, in the dozen or so relatively wealthy villages around East Gate Market, there were already many people addicted to the "Australian Lifestyle" and "Senator Enjoyment." These rich farmers idled all day drinking tea and wine at East Gate Market, or bragged ("piloted big ships") in Bopu. They knew they could live better if they worked a little harder, but they were already very satisfied with their current life. Some simply stopped going to the customary corvée labor for farmland water conservancy construction every winter and directly hired new immigrants to do it instead.

This point was not only felt by him and the Tiandihui; Senators on the industrial and agricultural frontlines and those engaging in civil affairs generally mentioned it. Senators in the finance and economics sector proposed appropriately increasing agricultural taxes and expanding the industrial-agricultural price scissors to reduce farmers' disposable income.

This was almost a universal practice in late-developing industrial countries, building an industrial system by maximizing the exploitation of rural surplus value in the absence of overseas markets. Although the Senate had a huge overseas market, its desire for capital and manpower was always unsatisfied.

In the view of professionals in the finance and economics sector, the living standards of farmers under the Senate's rule had improved too fast. The increase in disposable income inevitably led them to use the surplus accumulation to improve their lives—this was human nature. However, the Senate's industrial system was already very frail. Massive accumulation and industrial capacity must be used for export commodity production and expanding infrastructure investment. Now, to meet the needs of the private market and maintain the stable value of circulation coupons, they had to increase the production and sales of commodities for the local market.

This proposal caused great controversy within the Senate: the Senate wanted the new society in Lingao to have a "Beacon Effect," and improving farmers' living conditions was the most effective method in this spacetime. Forcibly suppressing farmers' income would not only damage this policy but also have an adverse impact on public sentiment.

Some busybodies then found another way, listing a development history of the Hainan State Farm system mainly composed of Sichuan and Hunan employees on the BBS. Seeing that post, Yun Suji couldn't help feeling empathetic, firming up their determination to "run for the ministry" and demand a larger share from the "Operation engine" immigration pool.

Regarding the agricultural sector's request for people, although the Planning Agency was very forthcoming, some still questioned whether Northerners could plant rice and tropical crops. Dugu Qiuhun, who was in charge of running for the ministry at the time, replied: "The discipline requirements of plantations are no less than those of industry and mining. We have enough whips and gallows."

No one questioned this point.

Northern immigrants settled in Northern Hainan were settled in an interspersed manner, mixed with Fujianese, and settled according to the Standard Village model. Among them, Lingao established 50 Standard Villages, Chengmai 35, and Qiongshan 12.

What was annoying was: the mindset of "satisfied with small wealth" prevented Standard Villages from maximizing efficiency. Wu Nanhai was very dissatisfied with this—he had boasted in the Administration Council, and if he couldn't boost output, he couldn't explain it. So he urged them to look and listen more during this investigation and try to find the crux of the problem.

"The traditional mindset of 'Good men don't earn money in June' must be broken by State Farms!" Yun Suji thought secretly.

Out of regard for Qiongzhou Prefecture City, the Senate had not directly entered Qiongzhou Prefecture City so far. Instead, a new town was built in the Haikou area. At the same time, an Army base was established: Haikou Fort.

As for the naval forces of Tang Yunwen at Baishashuizhai originally stationed in Haikou, they had now completely become decorations. Shortly after the disastrous defeat in Chengmai, Assistant Regional Commander Tang sent people to Guangzhou and other places to seek a transfer. Now he neither patrolled nor checked attendance, sitting and collecting the Senate's eight hundred yuan circulation coupon allowance every month waiting for a transfer. The remaining remnant soldiers also relied entirely on the Senate's "Assistance Pay"—of course not given for free, but exchanged for labor. Many able-bodied soldiers simply defected directly to the Australians, leaving only the old, weak, sick, and disabled whom the Australians looked down upon.

The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism utilized the courier station in Chengmai to establish a horse changing station. Yun Suji and Dugu Qiuhun changed horses and continued forward. Mongolian horses were not too adaptable to the environment here in Hainan, with a high mortality rate, so they had to be used with care.

On the four carriages, a Senator guard stood on each side, totaling eight. They wore tropical colonial pith helmets, short-sleeved shirts, straw sandals, and carried pistols. All carriages looked identical on the outside, but the two rode in the fourth carriage; the first three carried the accompanying naturalized staff and cadres. Large and small luggage was neatly bundled on top of the carriages.

Passing through Shishan (Stone Mountain), Yun Suji spoke up, asking Dugu Qiuhun about the deeds of the agricultural vehicle detachment chasing down Ming army routed soldiers in this area. Although Dugu Qiuhun didn't participate in the battle, he visited the battlefield shortly after it ended and knew a lot about it. He talked happily, even taking out a notepad to draw a battlefield situation map for Yun Suji.

"At that time, it was a mountain of corpses and a sea of blood. The agricultural vehicles chased all the way, corpses covering the ground, truly rivers of blood..." He couldn't help immersing himself in memories, "Look, that's the Requiem Monument built after the battle ended, specifically built for the dead Ming army officers and soldiers. Under the hill are the remains and ashes of the fallen soldiers." He pointed to a stone monument standing solitarily on a small hill outside Chengmai County City.

"What about our people?"

"All buried at Cuigang. This side is the monument for the Chengmai Battle." He pointed to another mound: "That is the ruins of the earth city built back then."

Facing Chengmai County City, on the ruins of the earthen embankment which had collapsed into a mound but still roughly showed its shape, stood a tall cylindrical monument. At the top stood the double-headed eagle military emblem cast from captured bronze cannons, standing on gears and wheat ears.

Yun Suji noticed that the hill was lush with green but free of weeds and shrubs. Surrounded by crisscrossing farmland and miscellaneous woods, a small path wound straight to the foot of the monument, obviously maintained by someone.

Seeming to know what he was thinking, Dugu Qiuhun said: "The Chengmai County Office is responsible for management here. Students from Fangcaodi come here for camping and field training every year, and incidentally tidy up the surrounding environment."

"That's the right way." Yun Suji said, "Educating the next generation well can inherit our cause."

"Educating the next generation is easy to say; the hardest to educate is this generation." Dugu Qiuhun said, "Do you know which number military emblem is on there?"

"?"

"The third one." Dugu Qiuhun smiled, "Because it's made of copper—actually not solid copper, just a wooden frame covered with copper sheet. The culprit caught was sent to the labor camp—I suggested dismembering him by five horses directly under the monument at that time, but the people from the legal sector disagreed—result: the second military emblem was installed and lost again within a few months. This time the Circuit Court sentenced death for 'Lèse-majesté' (Crime of Disrespect), dragged him to hang in front of the monument. After the third one was installed, it's been peaceful."

"In the end, it's still poverty..."

"No, actually they are not poor anymore, at least not to the point of needing theft to survive. Before we came, they didn't have enough to eat. Now? The few thieves caught all had stable sources of income."
