# Chapter 2027 - Ruling the World with Commoners

Li Suiqiu had actually already tasted the feeling of this "soft knife cutting flesh." Ever since the "tax commissioner" came a few days ago to file declarations, there had been no peace at home. Seeing the steward and accountant bring over the *Property Declaration Form* with difficult expressions, Li Suiqiu's eyes nearly fell out.

The *Declaration Form* was practically the King of Hell's ledger! Houses, land, and shops were one thing, but even listing how many *shi* of rent the family collected annually, how much rent from rented houses... everything had to be itemized. In the end, even income from calligraphy commissions (润笔) was listed separately—every kind of income you could think of was enumerated on this declaration form.

How to declare, the accountant dared not decide on his own and could only "request the master's instructions."

Li Suiqiu was speechless. Telling the truth, not only would he be exploited by the hair-thieves, but his family's true circumstances would be thoroughly exposed. Lying—well, the lessons of the past were not far off.

Moreover, these accountants couldn't be relied upon. They said "request the master's instructions," but during discussions a few days ago, they already showed timidity, constantly spouting discouraging remarks like "when under someone's roof" and advising him to "report truthfully" to avoid "causing trouble."

Li Suiqiu didn't blame them. In the past few months, during the hair-thieves' tax rectification, countless accountants had been implicated and punished. Fines and losing their jobs were secondary; many were sued and exiled. These people weren't his flesh and blood or household servants with deep bonds of gratitude; naturally, they wouldn't risk their lives.

If he were to handle it himself, these heaven-book-like accounts had reportedly been converted to Australian bookkeeping methods. But whether Li Suiqiu or his brothers, none understood double-entry or four-column accounting. Even wanting to falsify was beyond their ability.

Thinking thus, he was helpless. Li Suiqiu could only say: "Just report truthfully!"

"This reporting is no small matter..." Li Suiqiu smiled bitterly. "When my accountant went to pay taxes at the Tax Bureau, the tax receipt brought back for me to see—my family's ten years of land taxes wouldn't add up to this amount."

This remark resonated: "My family is the same!"

"My old man also said if we keep paying taxes like this, sooner or later we'll have to sell land and property to pay."

"These Australians have commoners shouting 'Long live the Council of Elders' every day; I say it's 'Long live Taxes' that's more accurate."

"Heard that this year's land tax collection will have new tricks, saying they'll 'clarify mu counts' before levying land taxes. Families who commended their land to us have been coming these days asking me to figure something out—what can I figure out!"

...

"The Australians treat gentry and scholar-officials so harshly; surely they don't really intend to share the world with commoners?" someone said gloomily. "I see in Australian gazettes and documents, always saying: the Council of Elders and the People. Isn't 'the People' just commoners?"

"Since ancient times, gentry and scholar-officials have been the foundation of the realm. These Australians call themselves Great Song; even if it's a false claim, they should know the Great Song most revered scholar-officials. Minister Wen said: 'We rule the world with scholar-officials, not with commoners.' The Council claims to be Song descendants; surely they know this saying? Yet now they keep finding ways to trample on scholars and gentry. Could they really intend to rule the world with commoners?"

Li Suiqiu said: "How many gentry and scholar-officials are there? How many commoners? The hair-thieves' strategy is nothing but playing with the words 'popular support.'"

"Although Mencius said: The people are the most important, the state comes next, and the ruler is the least important—since ancient times, it's unheard of to share the world with commoners. Governing and managing a state, even we who are well-read wouldn't lightly claim to 'understand,' let alone ordinary commoners who barely know a few characters?"

...

Li Suiqiu thought secretly: since ancient times, those who win popular hearts win the world; the Australians' actions are nothing more than this. Honestly, Li Suiqiu rather admired these "three strategies." If used well, they would naturally bring national peace and people's security. However, this "suppressing the power of the mighty" perhaps struck too broadly. He himself and his teachers and friends couldn't be counted as "the mighty" by any measure—merely having an examination degree and somewhat more property and land, respectable elder families who treated people well. Now they too had become targets of the hair-thieves' attacks. He was truly displeased. Could it be that these hair-thieves, as many said, were enemies of the Way and couldn't tolerate scholars?

Thinking of this, he felt secretly worried. Since Guangzhou fell, the question of where to go had been lingering in his mind. He had strong notions of loyalty and filial piety and couldn't, like others, shut the door and live in a "pot-sized world," escaping reality. The humiliation that Ming territory was usurped by sea pirates always hung over him.

Many times, he had the urge to leave Guangzhou, go to Guangxi or the capital, serve the court, and recover Guangdong.

Leaving wouldn't be difficult. The hair-thieves held a "go or stay as you please" policy even for Ming officials who fell into enemy hands locally. For ordinary commoners, even more so. But he had a large family to care for—his mother was already elderly; abandoning his family was truly unbearable...

Collecting his thoughts, he heard the room still discussing taxation matters.

...

"Taxing land and property is one thing, but even keeping servants requires taxes, and 'progressive' at that—the more you keep, the higher the tax. What kind of twisted logic is this? Yesterday I told my father, if they really tax this, better to release them all, cancel their contracts, and let them beg food from the Australians! In this Great Song world, even doing good deeds gets you struck by lightning!"

"My family has over three hundred servants, but really less than half are useful. Once this tax starts, we'll have no choice but to return their contracts and ask them to leave. What's hard is those household-born servants with generations of gratitude; to really make them fend for themselves feels unbearable!"

"My family is the same! How many are actually useful? It's just that we saw children from poor families who couldn't survive, sent to seek a livelihood—so we took them in."

"Now even doing good deeds is impossible."

"Heh, you're still thinking about their livelihood—the hair-thieves have already planned their livelihood: When the whole family falls destitute onto the streets, they'll be collected and sent to Qiongzhou to farm and work for the Australians. Naturally, they'll have a bowl of food, and they'll tearfully thank the Council of Elders—how poisonous!"

This meal was rather unpleasant. Although everyone vented their frustrations, no problems were solved. Resisting taxes was impossible; they could only cope by paying. As for the hair-thieves, there was no "sign of defeat" for the time being.

Walking out of the garden, outside was still the hair-thieves' world. Streets were bustling, with many arrogant "fake baldies" (naturalized citizens). Black-clad police leisurely patrolled the streets. Shops hung signs saying "Newly Arrived Australian Goods"; rickshaws newly imported from Lingao rang their bells, rushing by. The two-bearer sedan chairs of the past were rarely seen.

Walls were covered with huge Song-style "slogans," glaringly red: "Tax Revenue is National Policy," "Paying Taxes According to Law is Everyone's Responsibility," "New Life, New Days," "Down with All Reactionaries' Plots and Schemes!" "Environmental Hygiene is Everyone's Responsibility," "Guard Against Fire, Theft, and Spies"...

He lowered the sedan curtain, not wanting to see these glaring slogans. The Australians had spent great capital whitewashing walls of many street-facing houses with lime, only to smear these phrases on them—truly a waste...

Complaining silently all the way, his sedan returned to his home on Haoxian Street. At home, there was an atmosphere of peace and quiet, as if the earth-shaking changes outside had never happened, sparing him those glaring slogans and fake baldy men and women in Australian-style clothes.

If one could shut the door and while away the years, that would be acceptable too, Li Suiqiu thought.

Walking inside, he saw a Daoist escorted by the steward coming out from within. Seeing Li Suiqiu, the Daoist hurriedly bowed in greeting.

Looking closely, it was Qing Jing, the reception Daoist from Five Immortals Temple. Li Suiqiu normally didn't worship monks and Daoists, but Qing Jing was different—the reception Daoist of Five Immortals Temple, Guangzhou's premier Daoist temple. So he gave some face. He smiled: "What? Coming again to bring blessings to the old madam?"

After a Jiao ritual ended, various offerings distributed to participating Daoists were called "scattering blessings." Temples would also send some to connected wealthy households, signifying sharing blessings. In reality, it was to obtain gifts—another form of "beating the autumn wind."

Qing Jing smiled: "Our small temple hasn't held any Jiao recently; no blessings to scatter for now. This humble Daoist came to invite the old madam to participate in meritorious giving."

Li Suiqiu thought: this Daoist is still the same, never changing. He said: "Isn't your place now the Australians' Daoist Registry? I heard several Australian Daoists came, preaching Australian Daoism—does Australian Daoism also hold Jiao rituals?"

Qing Jing was a reception Daoist with quick wits; how could he not hear the mockery in Master Li's words? He smiled apologetically: "You jest, Master. What Australian Daoism or Ming Daoism? We worship the Three Pure Ones, Four Emperors, and Celestial Officials of Luotian all the same. Last year, by Governor Liu's command, we held an eighteen-day salvation Jiao—this time, a donor wants to hold a Blessing and Peace Jiao. The abbot says this is a rare beautiful occasion and wants to invite all the masters in Guangzhou to participate in meritorious giving..."

"Oh, which master is holding this Blessing and Peace Jiao?" Li Suiqiu asked casually.

"This time it's Master Zhang who wants to hold the Jiao..."

"Master Zhang? Which Master Zhang?"

"The proprietor of Zhang's Food Company, Zhang Yu... Master Zhang..."

"What? Zhang Yu?" Li Suiqiu smiled speechlessly. Right, this young manager of a tea-snack shop who was worthless three years ago somehow latched onto the hair-thieves' thick legs and suddenly prospered. He became someone called "Master" openly. Now he was the hottest person in the city. Let alone a Daoist—even Gao Ju, the Australians' former top partner, now had to politely call him "Brother Zhang" upon seeing him—and that wasn't something ordinary people could do.

"Yes, exactly Master Zhang." Qing Jing then explained about the Australians' matchmaking event and collective wedding.

"...You see, isn't this a beautiful occasion? So Master Zhang stepped forward, asking our temple to hold a three-day Blessing Jiao to pray for blessings and offspring for the newlyweds."
