# Chapter 2051 - Nothing New Under the Sun

"Mm, your thinking is sound. I'll coordinate with the Police Bureau on this..." Wang Qiyi said, though his mind was calculating how long it would take to copy the materials from the Police Bureau—this time and space had no photocopiers. The various basic social information gathered through the Guangzhou Police Bureau's "household surveys" had already been sent to the Municipal Government Printing Office for typesetting and printing under Liu Xiang's orders—he wondered how the progress was going...

One had to say these naturalized cadres had done quite well, and their suggestions were on point. But Wang Qiyi knew that the real big fish couldn't be caught this way. The reason was simple: even in the old time-space, people evaded supervision through verbal agreements (for instance, not exercising matured debts but having the other party repay through other means via oral agreements). And in seventeenth-century Ming, an era where verbal agreements might carry no less weight than written contracts, such situations were even more common. According to his deduction: the Lin family's shares in various industries could all show losses with no dividends for the major shareholders, but whenever the Lin family truly needed money, a single note would suffice for these taverns and teahouses to pay on their behalf—or perhaps even more directly, secretly delivering money to the Lin family, keeping it only in private ledgers and off the official books.

Wang Qiyi had been pondering this problem for quite some time. When he'd discussed it with his wife last night, she'd offered several suggestions. Today, after seeing Yao Yulan and the others' report, he was even more certain of his approach. He picked up his pen, thought for a moment, then wrote rapidly in the blank space on the first page: "Approve expanding the scope of investigation and seconding personnel from the Accounting Verification Office to assist. Consider focusing the investigation on industries where the Lin family holds significant stakes, particularly taverns..."

Hmm?... How many strokes on the left side of "tavern"? Pausing his pen, Wang Qiyi looked up and noticed the three naturalized cadres sitting across from him, backs straight, expressions solemn, staring at him unblinkingly. He couldn't help but tug awkwardly at the corner of his mouth, hurriedly crossing out the character "tavern" he'd written. "...particularly businesses where there is concrete evidence that the actual operator is Lin Zunxiu." Yao Yulan, this should be right up your alley, Wang Qiyi thought to himself, twirling his pen.

"Report, Director Wang, Team Leader Zeng and Investigator Huang are here. They say they have work to report."

"Let them in." Wang Qiyi set down the report he'd just signed and called to the three people in the room, "Everyone stay and listen together. Xu Zhewei, go borrow a stool from Director Zhang's office next door."

Zeng Juan pushed open the door and found only one empty chair in the room. Yao Yulan and Chu Xiaoran were seated on the three-person sofa, with an empty space beside them, though it didn't seem quite appropriate to sit there—besides, who knew if Colleague Xu would be coming back... Just as Zeng Juan was playing out this little drama in his head, Huang Ping casually plopped down next to Yao Yulan.

"Sit down for now, Team Leader Zeng. Xu Zhewei went to get a stool, so there'll be seats for everyone." As Wang Qiyi spoke, he reached into the drawer on his right and pulled out a white-boxed special-issue Sacred Ship cigarette, tapped one out and tossed it to Huang Ping. "Little Huang, catch..."

"Hey! Thank you, Director Wang!" Huang Ping quickly stood up and caught the flying cigarette with both hands. But knowing no one else in the room smoked, he casually tucked the cigarette behind his ear.

"Little Huang, let me ask you—where did you pick up this habit of tucking cigarettes behind your ear?"

"Director Wang, I learned it when I was learning to smoke from my upper bunkmate at vocational school. He said it was the style of the higher-ups, very popular, and everyone thought it gave off an Australian vibe. Actually, I'm not sure if it's true—you know Fangcaodi forbids smoking..."

Just then, Xu Zhewei came in carrying a chair.

"Now that everyone's here, let's begin. Team Leader Zeng, tell us about your trip to Hong Kong."

"Yes, Director Wang!" Zeng Juan stood up and handed over his report with both hands, then returned to his seat and began his briefing. "After Colleague Huang and I arrived in Hong Kong the day before yesterday, we immediately conducted an inspection of the warehouses the Shi family rents in Hong Kong according to protocol. Due to time and manpower constraints, after obtaining cooperation from the local customs, we selected several of the larger transit warehouses for spot checks. Overall, we found no issues—the inventories filed by the Shi family matched the warehouse spot-check results completely. We also reviewed the customs' shipping records and vessel manifests. According to Deputy Director Wei, he believes the vessels, shipping volumes, and voyage frequencies are all essentially consistent. His signed statement is on the last page of my report."

"Mm, so the Shi family can basically be considered clean?" Wang Qiyi thought this was within expectations—otherwise that Smith fellow probably wouldn't have been so confident.

"From an operational standpoint, there shouldn't be any problems." Zeng Juan paused thoughtfully, seemingly considering how to phrase his words. "But Director Wang, both Colleague Huang and I feel there's something abnormal about the warehouse they rent."

"How so?"

"They've rented a total of eleven warehouses, all owned by the Luo family's Guiren Ju. But according to the Qiwei manager responsible for transporting goods at the dock, two of them appear to have never been used—they've never transported goods out of or into those locations. One in particular is extremely small. When Guiren Ju was first building it, the dock's warehousing management area had suggested modifications, but the Luo family didn't accept them..."

Heh, now that's curious, Wang Qiyi thought. Should he transfer this over to Wu Mu's people for a look? The Luo family was done for anyway—if something else got scraped up, that would be pure profit. But there was no need to mention this to Zeng Juan and the others. He glanced at Yao Yulan. Damn, that dead-fish face again. I refuse to believe someone from Political Security wouldn't have a reaction to this. She's probably going to run off to report to that Yang Cao tonight. Thinking of this, Wang Qiyi suddenly felt resentful: whose troops were these, anyway?

"There's one more thing." Zeng Juan's suddenly raised voice startled Wang Qiyi, who had been lost in thought. "We discovered there's a significant problem with the rent Tianrui Garden pays to Guiren Ju. Logically speaking, there should be a well-established long-term contract between producers like Tianrui Garden, who have large quantities of goods requiring transit, and landlords like Guiren Ju, who own substantial dock warehouse space. Otherwise, whether it's Tianrui Garden switching to a different warehouse or Guiren Ju refusing to rent to Tianrui Garden, both parties would face unnecessary trouble and losses..." Zeng Juan steadied himself, then looked again at Wang Qiyi. The Director's approving gaze gave him confidence to continue. "But strangely, the rental contract between Tianrui Garden and Guiren Ju is signed for only half a year at a time! Each signing requires a large 'brokerage fee,' which Tianrui Garden also counts as rental expenses, listed under the transit warehouse account details. If we hadn't gone to Hong Kong, we never would have seen this going through the Sanya books. Add to this the fact that since the Executive Committee recovered Hong Kong, more and more people are using the island as a transit point, and Hong Kong warehouse rents have been rising steadily—especially those near the docks, which command a significant premium—so this expense doesn't look particularly out of place. Although doing this is completely legal and doesn't violate our regulations, something still feels off. We asked the person in charge of the transit warehouse about this broker's situation, and he said he didn't know either—plus he only handles the ledgers, not the payments."

"What does he base his accounting on without vouchers?" Wang Qiyi thought. This was a common tax evasion tactic—fabricating expenses to increase costs—nothing remarkable. But there was more to come.

"He has vouchers, but he can only manage accounts, not money. The cashier is sent from Tianrui Garden—comes over from Sanya quarterly with tax receipts, handles the payment and collection of ongoing business transactions, then takes the tax receipts to customs to offset the taxes due before returning to Sanya. Ordinarily, no money flows through his location."

"..." Wang Qiyi was stumped. This was truly encountering a worthy opponent. Young Master Shi was really talented! "Did you track down that broker?"

"No, we don't have that capability..." Zeng Juan shook his head regretfully.

"Director Wang, for someone where we only have a physical description but incomplete social identity information, if we want to investigate, we'd need police cooperation to start checking through Hong Kong's incoming ship manifests and hotel registries. We didn't have enough time." Huang Ping, having received law enforcement training in Lingao, clearly understood such matters better.

If only we had computers and networks, Wang Qiyi thought. Big data would be wonderful... But as it stood, they had to search through archived files. He'd seen the card-style mechanical calculators that Director Ai treasured like jewels: they were clumsy to use. Just punching holes in the cards for input required many people, and you had to queue for half a day to query a single item... The key was you could only search by preset fields, not perform fuzzy keyword searches.

"You mentioned large brokerage fees earlier—how large exactly?"

"It varies. Different each time, but always at least several hundred yuan. One payment last year even exceeded a thousand."

Hsss—over a thousand yuan! Wang Qiyi drew in a breath. Unlike those who imagined ancients threw around thousands or tens of thousands of taels like toys, Wang Qiyi's work had given him a clear understanding of the actual economic conditions of Ming society. Not only was it far from what appeared in films and dramas, but even compared to the later Qing dynasty, Ming silver had far greater purchasing power.

Although they had now abolished taels in favor of yuan, the new currency was still essentially silver-backed. Its purchasing power was solid. Land prices in the area around Guangzhou's Great World were rising, yet Zhang Yu had paid only around three hundred yuan for eighty mu of land. Miss Dong's shop, despite being so popular, would only generate about a hundred yuan in total annual revenue. That thousand yuan would be enough to buy several hundred mu of prime farmland in the countryside and become a landlord.

But failing to track down the broker was no problem, Wang Qiyi thought, pivoting. The monk may run, but the temple stays. "Tomorrow, you two go to the Shi family..."

Ring ring ring... The telephone rang.

"Yes, this is Wang Qiyi! Oh, Director Wu... hold on..." Before Wang Qiyi could even look up to speak, Huang Ping asked, "Director Wang, should we step out and wait?"

"Yes." Once he saw that all the naturalized cadres had left the room, Wang Qiyi removed his hand from the mouthpiece and continued, "Director Wu, we can talk now... What?!"
