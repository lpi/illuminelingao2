# Chapter 1750: Household Census

Because of reading "Australian Military Science" magazines like "War History Research," Zhang Yu and his friends all knew that Australians valued "Soldier's Sense of Honor" the most, and held a critical attitude towards "valuing civil over military" and "controlling military with civil" since the Song Dynasty, especially criticizing the extreme depreciation of military officers' status in the Great Ming—this even resonated with Li Ziyu.

"Only soldiers with a sense of honor can form an invincible army." This sentence impressed Zhang Yu deeply at the beginning, but he had no concept at all about what counted as having a "sense of honor." Now, from these "Senate soldiers," he roughly understood what "Soldier's Sense of Honor" was.

The posture of Fubo Army soldiers standing like pines and sitting like bells; walking in uniform lines of two or columns of three, the crisp and clean appearance and attire... all gave people a strong sense of deterrence, which was completely on a different level from the fear generated by veteran soldiers relying on ruthlessness and barbarism.

Despite this, they spoke very kindly to the common people and didn't demand anything from them. Zhang Yu's family had half their shop eaten empty by the Chaozhou Braves who came to "assist defense" a few years ago. His parents knelt on the ground kowtowing repeatedly and begging bitterly, before the small leader threw down a string of inferior coins that would break into eight pieces if dropped on the ground, and left patting his butt.

The world has indeed changed. Zhang Yu sighed with emotion in his heart.

Taking the opportunity of delivering goods everywhere, he went to find his friends. Zeng Juan was now much like him: helping with work at home, sometimes going out to deliver goods; but Li Ziyu's big gate was tightly closed. He knocked for half a day but no one answered. Zeng Juan said his family might have fled to the countryside—the Australians posted notices requiring military households of various guards in the city to report for roll call and reorganization. Many guard officers had fled.

"Why flee? What use can those few soldiers in the guard have?" Zhang Yu knew that guard soldiers were useless. The Australians wouldn't go so far as to slaughter them, nor would they necessarily want them to be soldiers—besides, even being a soldier for the Australians wasn't bad, at least they paid wages on time.

"Ordinary military households are just common people, naturally nothing to fear." Zeng Juan said, "But Li Ziyu's family are hereditary military officers... The Australians are rectifying the clerks and runners in the yamen this time, allowing common people to file complaints and report. Those with great public indignation and blood debts have all been taken down, and are now being tortured in the big prison to recover illicit money..."

"So what? They are military households, not local clerks." Zhang Yu didn't understand.

"My Little Master, why don't you understand. Military officers usually eat and drink well. Military households work and serve them all year round. Not to mention being beaten and scolded, in the end they fall to selling sons and daughters, and there are even those who freeze and starve to death. You say with this reorganization and roll call, what will happen?"

"So it's like this!" Zhang Yu suddenly understood, "So saying..."

"That's right. I heard people say that surrendering troops are concentrated in the parade ground these days, asked to be reported by soldiers and military households. Many officers have already been arrested." Zeng Juan said, "Can Li Ziyu's family not run?"

"Ziyu's family should have nothing..." Zhang Yu originally wanted to say "nothing wrong," but thinking again, Li Ziyu said his uncle was very rich. This money wasn't obtained by exploiting military households. As for whether his uncle had blood debts, this was even more beyond their knowledge.

Thinking of this, he couldn't help sighing: "Don't know where Ziyu ran to now."

"I think we won't see him anymore. Maybe he has already run to the north." Zeng Juan also sighed. Regardless of how much of a young master temper Li Ziyu usually had, they were good friends after all, and he was the "financier" of their small group. Everyone had benefited from him. Feeling suddenly lost like this, they couldn't help feeling disappointed.

Coming back from delivering goods that day, as soon as he entered the door, he saw several more people in his shop hall. The leaders were several "Australians" wearing black uniform coats, and beside them were several "assistants" wearing brass basin hats. In recent days, he had seen them checking pedestrians and patrolling streets. Heard people say this was the "Australian Fast Class"—the Australian name was "Police."

For no rhyme or reason, what did the Australian Fast Class come to his house for? Zhang Yu felt flustered immediately. Looking again, there was someone he knew inside, the local Jia Chief Old Daddy He.

Seeing an acquaintance, he felt somewhat settled. His mother saw him back and hurriedly greeted: "Yu'er, come over quickly to pay respects to the gentlemen!"

Zhang Yu hurried over to bow with hands clasped. The leading Australian said: "No need for formalities. Since Little Brother is back, let's seize the time to fill out the forms. There are still many families to handle below."

Zhang Yu then realized that these police came to his home to "report household registration." This matter wasn't strange, because every year Bao Chiefs and Jia Chiefs inevitably accompanied runners to "check Paijia Registers." Actually, they didn't check anything. Speaking unofficial Mandarin and saying a few polite words, when leaving, one inevitably had to give a few hundred coins of "straw sandal money." His mother said, "Checking once, the shop works for nothing for a day."

But if one didn't handle it carefully and annoyed this group of masters, saying you were suspected of "concealing bandits," directly chaining you to the yamen, then it wouldn't be a problem of a few hundred coins. Once a person entered the detention cell, don't dream of coming out without taking out some real gold and silver. Shopkeeper Cao who opened the small carpentry shop had suffered this. Locked next to the urine bucket all night without food or drink, and was released only after spending several taels of silver the next day.

"This is your son?" The police asked.

"Yes, it is exactly my wretched son." Zhang Yu's father hurriedly answered.

"You only have this one child?"

"Originally there were a few more, didn't keep them..."

"Name?"

"Called Zhang Yu."

"How is it written? Recognize characters? Come, write it!" Saying this, he handed over paper and pen.

Zhang Yu hurriedly wrote down his name. The police examined it and handed it to a police officer who looked like a clerk beside him. "Write it down." He instructed, "Name Zhang Yu, relationship with householder: father and son." Then he asked: "Date of birth?"

"Born on the ninth day of the third month in the Wuwu year of Wanli."

"Which year is it in the Gregorian calendar?" The police officer acting as the scribe wrote it and asked the questioning police.

"The Wuwu year of Wanli is the forty-sixth year of Wanli..." The police opened a book, "1618!"

The Zhang family didn't know what this 1618 meant and didn't dare to ask more.

"Born here? Is he born by you and your current wife?"

In medieval society, the rate of maternal mortality was extremely high. Men with some economic ability naturally would remarry. In addition, there were various complex factors such as being born of maids/concubines or pawned wives. It wasn't rare for children not to be born by the mistress of the house.

"Yes, exactly at home." Zhang Yu's father answered, "The little son is indeed born by my mountain wife (humble term for wife)."

"Education level?" After asking, the police probably felt asking this way was inappropriate, and added, "Study books?"

"Yes, the wretched son studies at the community school..."

"Shopkeeper Zhang," the police said, "Let your son speak for himself."

Zhang Yu thought for a moment and said: "I have studied at the community school for seven years. can read Four Books and Five Classics, have already started learning to write essays and poems, and participated in the Tongzi Exam last year..."

However, his lengthy speech only exchanged for "Private School Intermediate" filled in the form.

Because the cultural level of traditional education was difficult for the Senate to measure specifically, household registration adopted a simplified mode. Those with academic degrees had their education level filled in directly according to the degree obtained; those without degrees were divided into three levels. Studied in private school for several years but haven't started learning to write Eight-legged Essays counted as "Private School Primary"; participated in Tongzi Exam counted as Intermediate; participated in Tongzi Exam twice or more counted as Advanced.

Since the lists of personnel participating in imperial examinations and every Tongzi Exam were archived in the government yamen, they could be compared and approved. Avoiding people intentionally reporting high or low.

"Can you use an abacus?"

This was added to adapt to the needs of this space-time. After all, those who could use an abacus to calculate were considered professional talents in the 17th century. They were still useful to the Senate. Therefore, they also had to be registered.

"Yes." Zhang Yu secretly wondered. Do they have to ask about using the abacus too?

"Married?"

Zhang Yu's face couldn't help blushing: "No."

"Done." The questioning police said, "Next family!"

After speaking, several people packed up their things and got up to leave. Zhang Yu's father hurriedly offered a string of coins, smiling all over his face: "Gentlemen have worked hard. This is straw sandal money, a mere trifle not enough to be a respect..."

Zhang Yu saw the eyes of several "assistants" lighting up. However, those few black-clothed police were unmoved. The leader said: "Shopkeeper, under the rule of our Senate, we don't do this! Cooperating with our work is the best help. Take the money back. It's not easy for you to make a small business and earn a few coins."

Zhang Yu's father wanted to be polite again, but the police had already led people out. Old Daddy He said: "Shopkeeper Zhang, no need! Now it's the Senate's world, this set is not popular."

His father whispered: "Old Daddy He, you can't be harming people."

Old Daddy He smiled: "I accompanied them to six families today. The previous ones didn't take straw sandal money. Can your family be an exception? This shining silver moves people's hearts. You'd better take it back and spend it yourself."

Hearing the Jia Chief say this, the whole family relaxed. Zhang Yu went out to look, only to see the group had already entered the tofu shop. Only two people were banging on the lintel of the tofu shop with hammers, startling him. Looking closely, they nailed a wooden board with words written by fire branding. On one side was written Huifu Street, and on the other side were "Tashi (Arab) Numerals" seen in "Australian Magazines." Beside them, Chinese characters were also marked.

Looking again, every family along the street they passed had been nailed with this board. The numbers of each family were different. His own family also had this house number nailed—he secretly thought the Australians' idea was brilliant! With every family numbered, it would be much easier to find them. When he went out to deliver goods, delivering to tea houses was okay, just looking at the signboards. Delivering to private residences was a difficult problem. Because they only said XX Street/Alley, the numbered family from east to west. At most added a sentence "there is a big tree at the gate," "there is a water well not far on the street" as markers.
