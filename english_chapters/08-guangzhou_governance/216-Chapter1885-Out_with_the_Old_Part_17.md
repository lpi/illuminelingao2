# Chapter 1885 - Out with the Old, In with the New (Part 17)

The most common types of plague include mild plague, bubonic plague, pneumonic plague, and septicemic plague. The latter two are extremely dangerous types. Current consensus holds that Europe's Black Death pandemic and the great Chinese plague outbreak of the late Qing and early Republic periods were predominantly these two forms.

Because Chinese historical records on infectious diseases were very general—simply labeled "pestilence" or "great epidemic" with minimal details on disease progression or symptoms—many people developed the impression that ancient China had no virulent infectious diseases. Even within the Executive Council, quite a few Elements believed that "only the dirty Europeans got plague" or that "Chinese people rarely caught infectious diseases."

The health authorities naturally didn't believe this kind of "racial/civilizational superiority theory": being human meant being susceptible to disease. Regarding plague and cholera—the two Class A infectious diseases from the old timeline—they had conducted specialized research and reviewed extensive historical materials and research documents. They had largely determined that in the 17th century, "true" cholera—classical cholera—had not yet spread to China. This disease had been endemic to India and Bengal until the 19th century, only being brought to Guangzhou by British traders in the early 19th century. The "cholera" mentioned in traditional Chinese medicine texts was mostly a general term for various gastrointestinal infectious diseases.

As for plague, there had indeed been a major outbreak in the late Ming period. However, research suggested this plague was limited to the north, especially the Shanxi and Hebei areas. In the south, particularly the Guangdong region, there had been no plague epidemics.

Why was it suddenly appearing now? Both Liu San and Lin Motian fell into deep thought. Since D-Day, their governance had relied considerably on historical materials provided by the Great Library as reference—and these had indeed been very useful. However, the current situation demonstrated that the butterfly stirred by the Executive Council was creating increasingly powerful storms, and history was gradually departing from the Great Library's predictions.

"I think the problem might have originated with the leather trade." Liu San said.

Before the Guangdong Campaign began, the foreign trade department had made large-scale concentrated purchases of raw hides for military supply purposes—primarily for making boots, belts, helmet suspensions, and other military necessities. They had also made leather caps, leather vests, leather jackets, and other cold-weather clothing for troops deployed to the north and maritime personnel.

These purchases were mostly made through agents, greatly stimulating related trade. However, raw hides were inexpensive, and apart from the Executive Council's military and industrial use, civilian demand on Hainan Island was extremely limited.

Originally, Ming dynasty people didn't particularly value fur clothing. The famous confiscation list of the notorious Yan Song, *Tianshui Bingshan Lu*, contained very few fur items. But this didn't mean there was no such demand. In the smuggling trade between the Later Jin and Ming, the largest export item was ginseng, followed by furs. Due to the Little Ice Age's low temperatures and the fashion trends led by the Ziming Tower, expensive furs like sable and otter began becoming a fashionable choice among wealthy Guangdong households.

After the Foreign Trade Company, seeking to "earn foreign exchange through exports," sold furs processed with modern tanning methods—like sable and other high-grade furs—to the Dutch and English, Guangzhou's fur export trade flourished. The enormous profits attracted many merchants into the fur trade.

Though the Executive Council strictly limited imports of furs from weasel family animals like sable, otter, and marmot from Qing-controlled territories—both limiting quantities and requiring quarantine due to fear of plague transmission—given Guangzhou's current situation, they simply couldn't implement strict health quarantine for all incoming goods. The high profits from furs led merchants to take risks entering the Liaodong trade, and many unquarantined furs were entering the Guangzhou market directly or indirectly.

The hectic floating population, the crude and poor housing conditions, the still-backward hygiene awareness, the weak grassroots organization... Guangzhou's public health system, viewed from a modern perspective, was as leaky as a sieve. A plague epidemic that hadn't occurred in the old timeline was seizing the opportunity to quietly spread across Guangdong.

"Fur is only one factor. If it were the fur, cases should have started among people in related industries." Lin Motian disagreed. "The first patient shouldn't have been a beggar. He's a flea transmission victim—after all, flea parasitism is common in that population."

"This has become complicated." Liu San was somewhat agitated.

Lin Motian said: "We need to take immediate action."

The bubonic plague currently appearing in Guangzhou was relatively less infectious, but without intervention, bubonic plague could transform into pneumonic plague and septicemic plague. If pneumonic and septicemic plague broke out, the consequences would be unthinkable. So Liu San fully agreed with Lin Motian's assessment—no one knew when a real major epidemic might explode.

According to some accounts, Li Zicheng's rapid downfall was significantly related to his army contracting plague upon entering Beijing. If they couldn't quickly contain the epidemic, they might follow in Li Zicheng's footsteps—forced to retreat from Guangzhou in disarray under disease's assault, returning to Hainan to continue lying low. If they were even more unlucky and plague broke out on Hainan, then all their ideals and ambitions, if not destroyed, would have to be delayed many years before they could be realized.

"Where is the body now? And the contacts?"

"Burned on site. But I've already sent someone to extract blood samples." Liu San exhaled. "The dock has been sealed. All contacts have been isolated."

The two fell into silence. After a long while, Lin Motian opened a drawer, took out a document, scanned it briefly, added a few sentences, then rose solemnly and formally handed it over with both hands.

"This is my application." Lin Motian stood very seriously. "Element Lin Motian of the Great Song Australian Provisional Government solemnly requests the Executive Council to appoint me as Leader of the Guangzhou Special Municipality Epidemic Prevention Group, responsible for combating the plague epidemic!"

Liu San was instantly choked by his tea and coughed violently.

But Lin Motian remained calm, still humbly extending the application.

"Do you know what you're proposing to do?" Liu San coughed as he rose from the sofa. Though he knew Lin Motian wasn't a "well-behaved person," this request still shocked him greatly. He couldn't help widening his eyes and letting slip a crude word: "This isn't something you can solve by eating special-supply meals or using disinfectant! This is fucking plague!"

For an instant, Liu San thought he saw Lin Motian's face flash a mocking look that seemed to say "something even a Chinese medicine doctor like you can understand, you think I wouldn't know, being formally trained?" But then he decided he must have been seeing things, because when he examined Lin Motian closely, all he saw was that same humble, cold expression.

Currently, the Executive Council had no sufficiently safe and effective vaccines or treatments. Unlike gastrointestinal infectious diseases, plague could spread through fleas and respiratory droplets. Even as a senior leader of epidemic prevention work, one couldn't avoid going deep into epidemic areas and even having direct contact with patients—the risks were self-evident. And plague that could spread through respiratory droplets was the terrifying pneumonic form. Once contracted, there might not even be time to flee. Though they still had antibiotic reserves effective against plague, this was after all the primitive medical conditions of the late Ming—they absolutely couldn't guarantee a severe plague patient's survival, even if that patient was an Element.

"Dr. Liu, you're very clear about our current health situation in Guangzhou. We're both Elements, so let me speak frankly. This epidemic was probably within your expectations too—an outbreak was just a matter of time. As for myself, for the great cause of the Executive Council, naturally I'll go through fire and water without hesitation. As the saying goes, 'If it benefits my country, I shall take action regardless of life or...'" Lin Motian stopped mid-poem, seeing Liu San's expression, and immediately dropped the rest. "Um, in short, this isn't a sudden whim or impulse."

"Do you understand the epidemic situation?" Liu San asked, then realized this was almost a pointless question. The report was still sitting there; given Lin Motian's character, he had surely been studying the recent epidemic briefings constantly. Otherwise, he wouldn't have so rashly proposed taking on this responsibility.

"Whether Guangzhou currently has plague is not yet confirmed—that's point one. Second, from current information, even if it is plague, it's predominantly bubonic, which isn't as terrifying in terms of infectivity." Lin Motian tried to affect a confident demeanor. "If it develops to the point where pneumonic and septicemic plague are everywhere, even the Great Luo Golden Immortals couldn't hide—to put it further, if we cause a major plague pandemic, no one will escape. The Guangzhou situation we've worked so hard to establish will collapse at a touch."

Liu San looked at Lin Motian wordlessly... This man was gambling his life for career advancement.

Setting aside whether there was any comradeship between Elements, at minimum they shared a "if the rabbit dies, the fox grieves" kind of fellow feeling. If Old Lin cashed in his chips, as Guangzhou's highest health official, Liu San wouldn't come out looking good when he returned. After a long silence, he took the application and said: "I'll submit the application to the organization."

This wasn't something he could decide himself; it had to be submitted to the Executive Council. Leaders were always wise—and even if they weren't, at least they were more suitable for taking the blame than he was.

On the way back, Liu San was still thinking: Lin Motian really was different from himself. The saying went that "a person is the sum of all social relationships"—transmigrating alone to this era was essentially abandoning everything about oneself as a social being. Those who would leave home and family to actively request transmigration to this chaotic era all harbored some seeds of desperado in their hearts. This drive to risk one's life for career advancement reminded him of Lin Baiguang, who had started by recruiting the pirate Zhu Cailao... Coincidentally, this fellow and Lin Baiguang even shared the same surname.

After seeing Liu San off, Lin Motian calmed his emotions, opened his notebook, and began copying onto official document paper. From the dense writing and revision marks in the notebook, this document had clearly been in his thoughts for more than a day or two.
