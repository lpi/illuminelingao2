# Chapter 2042 - Collective Wedding (VII)

Following Fang Fei's instructions, the security perimeter began to contract, allowing observing commoners to approach all the way to the bottom of Great World's main entrance steps. The purpose, of course, was to let everyone watch the "song and dance performance" and see the people eating in the restaurant—thereby demonstrating the "new lifestyle."

The banquet was set in Great World's main hall, facing the plaza. The weather was hot, so all the doors and windows were opened, with only mosquito screens installed. This allowed guests in the hall to see the performance on the plaza stage without being bothered by flies and mosquitoes.

The entire hall was festooned with lanterns and decorations, completely renovated. On the screen wall in the center hung an enormous red velvet double-happiness character, flanked by red and gold velvet flower decorations of dragons and phoenixes in harmony.

Under the open eaves on both sides of the steps hung countless congratulatory banners and flower baskets of all varieties. The largest and most prominent among them belonged to the twelve "sponsors." Among these, the congratulatory banners from the Gao and Zhang families' businesses were displayed most prominently. Gao Ju had been grinning from ear to ear since arriving at the venue, because though he and the Zhang family's banners were in the "double-C" positions, his family's name was on the left while the Zhang family's was on the right. In his view, this was the Australians explicitly confirming his status as "Guangzhou's number one merchant."

At this moment, he was happily seated in the hall drinking tea and waiting. Since Guangzhou's recovery, Gao Ju had already attended several receptions hosted by the municipal government that featured this buffet format, so he roughly understood the rules and etiquette. Thus he wasn't like the other guests, full of bewilderment: the tables with name cards had nothing but tableware and tea sets, while the long tables on both sides were already covered with large and small pots and plates of silver, copper, pewter, and porcelain. Though all covered with lids, they couldn't hide the wafting delicious aromas.

He encountered many acquaintances at the venue. Actually, there weren't many guests on the newlyweds' side—most grooms and brides came from dire poverty. Their relatives were either dead or their whereabouts unknown. Those they could invite were mostly friends and colleagues. Thus the banquet was mostly filled with "sponsors." This included not just the "twelve sponsors" but also those wealthy households who had "made meritorious offerings" at the ritual. Though their purposes for "donating" varied, once the invitations were sent, not one dared not come—at minimum, they'd send a nephew from the clan to show up.

Though these acquaintances all came from gentry and wealthy backgrounds, some even from families of scholarly and literary tradition, this Australian-style etiquette was a first encounter. The tables covered with tablecloths had no appetizer plates or display fruits. Table seating charts made finding one's place convenient, but there was no distinction of precedence—as long as you were at the same table, everyone just sat anywhere.

They'd thought this would save time, but instead it caused them trouble, requiring another round of polite yielding. After quite a while, they still hadn't all taken their seats.

Gao Ju greeted acquaintances while instructing them on "Australian etiquette," all while praising "royal grace and virtue," describing the Council of Elders, Chief Wen, and Liu Xiang as if they were "Yao and Shun reborn," like "bodhisattvas descended from heaven." Making more than a few acquaintances secretly despise him—though amid the disdain, there was also envy: such shameless flattery wasn't something everyone was qualified to deliver.

Gao Ju naturally didn't care about others' opinions. He just felt wonderful, grinning unstoppably: Back when he had gotten in with Eunuch Yang, made his fortune in Guangzhou, and leapt to become one of Guangzhou's leading foreign trade magnates, he thought that was the pinnacle of his life. Who would have thought that he, Gao Ju, would see such a day!

The Council of Elders was truly his lucky star!

The more he thought, the more pleased he became. Seated in his chair, he watched the somewhat chaotic wedding venue. Suddenly he spotted Zhang Yu arriving. This young Master Zhang was also in high spirits today. He had the shaved "baldy" hairstyle of the Australians and wore a buttoned wool jacket—this type of jacket was made of imported "Florentine" wool, worn only by "senior cadres" among the naturalized citizens and Elders. From his chest pocket protruded a section of shiny silver watch chain, looking thoroughly "Australian-style."

"Wearing wool in this weather—aren't you afraid of stewing yourself to death!" Gao Ju disdained secretly, but his face was all smiles as he rose to greet him: "Young Master Zhang! You're here too?"

"Indeed. Hello, Master Gao." Zhang Yu now had a thoroughly "Australian-style" manner—no bowing with folded hands or cupped fists, just directly extending his hand for a handshake.

"Good, good. I never thought I'd be fortunate enough to attend such an event. Truly my Gao family ancestors were virtuous!" Gao Ju smiled brilliantly, gripping Zhang Yu's hand tightly.

The two exchanged pleasantries and took seats together. Though Gao Ju thoroughly disdained Zhang Yu in his heart, thinking he was merely lucky to be chosen by the Australians as an "example," really having no worth whatsoever—the Zhang family was currently red-hot, the "favored son" supported by the Australians, so he fawned over Zhang Yu to the utmost of his ability.

Zhang Yu had Chen Shixin on his mind, who had come to decorate the wedding venue, and was anxious to talk with him. He brushed off Gao Ju with a few words and left.

Gao Ju sneered coldly inside but didn't show it on his face. He smiled broadly, watching Zhang Yu leave, then returned to his seat.

The table was already set with cups, plates, and utensils, all fine porcelain. The appearance wasn't entirely new—probably borrowed from somewhere—after all, with so many tables, the porcelain patterns and marks all seemed different. Gao Ju turned his head to look at the neighboring table and was startled.

The porcelain patterns and styles on the adjacent table gave him a strange sense of familiarity. A name suddenly jumped into Gao Ju's mind. Then, afraid he was mistaken, he used the pretext of pouring tea to lean closer for a better look. Now he could see clearly.

Wasn't this Xue Guirong's Jiangxi fine porcelain set?! Gao Ju knew this porcelain set had been custom-ordered by Xue Guirong from Jiangxi for his son's wedding. The marks, patterns, and colors were all exclusive—absolutely unlike common porcelain. There couldn't be a second set in the market.

Master Xue had now become dried bones in a tomb, and his family didn't know where they'd ended up—he'd heard it was "property confiscated, family exiled to Taiwan." Presumably even if alive now, they were living a fate worse than death. He had once attended young Master Xue's wedding banquet and used this porcelain set. Never imagined it would now be placed on the Australians' collective wedding tables. For a moment, his spine went cold.

Just as he was feeling uneasy, someone suddenly patted his shoulder, startling him. Looking up, it was Zhang Yikun, the general manager of Great World. Zhang Yikun was one of the Elders managing Guangzhou's commercial trade, so Gao Ju naturally knew him well. He quickly rose and bowed: "Chief Zhang..."

"What? You came alone today?" Because of running Great World, Zhang Yikun was quite familiar with Guangzhou's merchants large and small, with a somewhat casual manner. "Why didn't Third Concubine come? I invited her too."

"She's nobody of standing—how could she appear at such an occasion." Gao Ju said modestly. He could accept everything about the Australians, except for the etiquette concerning women—this, Gao Ju absolutely could not accept. Not just appearing in public at such occasions, but eating at the same table with a bunch of unrelated men... He might not be able to control other women, but he could still control his own concubine.

"That's not the right attitude." Zhang Yikun shook his head. "Today is the Council of Elders' wedding celebration. Though Third Concubine isn't your principal wife, she should still make an appearance on such a day."

"Yes, yes, the Chief's instruction is correct." Gao Ju replied respectfully.

Zhang Yikun saw his usual attitude of surface compliance but inner refusal to change, and knew this wouldn't be easy—when he'd sent invitations to guests, they all stated "couple," but less than one in a hundred brought their wives. Plenty brought sons and nephews to "see the world and make connections," though.

It seemed changing customs really wasn't an easy thing. Zhang Yikun shook his head. Actually, he had originally wanted his own wife to come today, but this daughter of a Guangzhou merchant family considered herself a "lady" and refused to "show her face in public," firmly declining to attend.

If he couldn't even educate his own wife, what hope did he have with Gao Ju?

Thinking of this, he could only shake his head helplessly and went off to supervise and coordinate the banquet's proceedings.

In the center of the hall was the Australians' specialty: an ice sculpture. First, it could cool down the somewhat sultry weather; second, it demonstrated the Council of Elders' "luxury." To suit the theme, today's ice sculpture was a pair of mandarin ducks. Surrounding the ice sculpture were fruits and fresh flowers. Approaching it, one could feel a stream of cool, crisp air mixed with the sweet fragrance of fruit and flowers.

Just this ice sculpture attracted many guests and newlyweds to gather around and watch. Thus it was melting faster than Zhang Yikun had anticipated. He quickly ordered more ice blocks to be brought and piled around the sculpture to lower the surrounding temperature, and also to prevent onlookers from getting too close.

Because too many people were looking at "Australian spectacles" everywhere, the newlyweds had been in the hall for nearly half an hour without everyone being seated. An anxious Zhang Yikun called "please be seated" through the speakers again and again. After calling more than ten times, everyone was finally more or less settled and the banquet could officially begin.

At Fang Fei's command, the temporarily assembled servers removed the large and small pot lids and white napkins from the long tables on both sides. A rich aroma immediately filled the air, making the guests' nostrils involuntarily twitch and their mouths reflexively water...

"The banquet officially begins! Please help yourselves to the food!"

But the guests were bewildered. They said the banquet was beginning, but they only saw servers walking around with pot lids—no one serving food. What kind of protocol was this? The guests looked at each other, completely uncertain of this Australian etiquette. Gao Ju saw his tablemates also looking at each other. He smiled at Zhang Yu: "Young Master Zhang, let's go get some first and show everyone how it's done?"
