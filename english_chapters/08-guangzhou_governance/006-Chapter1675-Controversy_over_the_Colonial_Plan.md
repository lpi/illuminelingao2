# Chapter 1675 - Controversy over the Colonial Plan

"It won't come to that, right?"

"Old Si, look, you truly don't understand the folk customs of Guangdong too well. Although Cantonese, Chaoshan, and Hakka people are all Han Chinese of Guangdong, their relationships are like water and fire—far from just 'not getting along.' Once they start armed fighting, it's the rhythm of killing the whole family. And this kind of fighting doesn't change because of migration. The Manchu Qing migrated a part of Guangdong Hakkas to Hainan due to Local-Hakka conflicts, resulting in Local-Hakka armed fighting appearing in Hainan too. Besides, Hakka people and Chaoshan people are famously clannish. Putting these two groups together is bad enough, but if you mix Fujianese (Minnan) in there too, is it because you think they won't kill each other happily enough?"

"You mean none of these people can be used?"

"My meaning is: before systematic social transformation, breaking old social structures, and instilling modern national and civic consciousness, mere manipulation of 'using barbarians to control barbarians' and checking each other is useless. It will only further intensify contradictions, even inviting wolves into the house. In the old spacetime, were there few cases of Southeast Asian Chinese playing 'using barbarians for self-importance' and seducing natives to massacre their compatriots? You should know that in the old spacetime, those who harmed overseas Chinese most ruthlessly were mostly Chinese. In the 17th century, this situation will only be more serious." Ran Yao denounced.

"Xue Ruowang wanting to engage in plantations is not impossible, but it cannot be chosen in Palembang—that is the territory of the Aceh Sultanate. The Dutch have a little influence, but Aceh is not to be trifled with. If we stick a foot in, small investment can't keep it, large investment isn't worth it. Little Xue himself is stuck in Batavia and can't look after Palembang. We would have to send another Senator to watch... Since we are already preparing to open a base in Brunei to extract oil, just put the tropical plantation in Brunei." Wu De effectively shot down this plan. "As for Little Xue, his work in Batavia is still very important, especially to urge the Dutch to plant our rubber well."

Wu Nanhai was most concerned about tropical plantations, so he expressed his stance: "I am one hundred percent in favor of engaging in tropical plantations. As for where to do it, I have no opinion. The Dutch are probably unreliable; no one in this spacetime has run a rubber plantation yet, so they have to explore slowly. I think it's more reliable if we handle it ourselves. I have a Senator here named Xiao Hezhou who has always wanted to engage in rubber planting. How about letting him handle this stall in Brunei?"

"Xiao Hezhou? Fried chicken cutlets in the cafeteria before—his coconut crisp chicken cutlet is quite good, but heard he did finance or something. Does he know rubber?"

"He hasn't been in the cafeteria for a long time. Now he is an agricultural technician in our farm's tropical crop experiment garden, also concurrently a technician in the food factory: besides chicken cutlets, he actually knows how to make fish floss—never mind that. Talking about knowing rubber planting, actually I don't know either; we all have to learn from scratch. I see he is very motivated."

"As long as he is willing to go to Brunei himself, I don't see any problem." Ma Qianzhu said, "Letting the broad masses of Senators go out to take charge of a side alone is the hard truth. Of course, public recruitment still needs to be done; if there are more suitable candidates, they can go too."

Seeing no objections, Ma Qianzhu turned the document to the next page: "Next let's talk about agricultural issues, especially grain. If grain is insufficient, people's hearts will be unstable. To conquer the mainland, we need large amounts of grain to buy people's hearts and protect manpower."

Wu Nanhai cleared his throat; "Let me speak briefly. Our directly operated cultivated land in Hainan, Taiwan, and Jeju Island—including state-owned farms and contracted land under the Tiandihui—dry land and paddy fields total about 1 million mu. Next year, we prepare 500,000 mu of paddy fields to plant two seasons of rice and one season of astragalus sinicus (green manure). The two seasons' average yield per mu can harvest about 600 catties of unhusked rice, equivalent to about 450 catties of brown rice. Calculated at 30 catties of grain per person per month on average, rice alone can feed 620,000 people. Considering this is only our directly operated land, not counting the harvest of Hainan peasants and landlords' self-operated parts, feeding the common people of Hainan, Taiwan, and Jeju Island is not a problem."

"Is this yield estimate a bit high? I remember pesticides and chemical fertilizers have never been sufficient. Not all state-owned farm arable land has undergone soil and water improvement." Ma Qianzhu expressed concern.

"Part of this 500,000 mu has undergone soil and water improvement, and part consists of paddy fields with originally better conditions. Plus our advantages in seeds and field management, achieving this average yield is completely doable. I have done surveys: in agricultural counties like Qiongshan and Wenchang in Hainan, the yield per mu of single-season late rice in ordinary paddy fields in normal years can reach over 2 shi (approx. 200kg+)."

Wu Nanhai spoke unambiguously, and everyone nodded frequently. Although they used to be ordinary people, over these few years they had all become key government officials in charge of a region and understood the importance of grain to the nation better than before.

"The remaining 500,000 mu are mainly dry land and paddy fields with poor conditions. Except for a part used to plant economic crops, I plan to use all of it to plant potatoes, sweet potatoes, and miscellaneous grains. The total output of this part can feed another 400,000 people, which is doable."

1 million people, this was roughly the total population of the Senate-ruled area. However, farmers fed themselves and had to pay land tax to the Senate. The Senate could also import rice from Tonkin and Siam as supplements. This grain was their capital for launching the Liang-Guang Campaign.

"...The main problems in our agriculture are still old tunes. Modern agriculture has three magic weapons: seeds, chemical fertilizers, and pesticides. We have seeds, but the breeding scale can't catch up; the sowing rate of improved varieties even on directly operated land doesn't reach thirty percent; chemical fertilizers are too scarce, now relying on planting green manure and fermentation of feces and garbage to replace nitrogen fertilizer, using guano and fish meal to replace phosphate fertilizer—not only low efficiency but also labor-intensive; the problem with pesticides is the biggest: we basically cannot produce chemical pesticides, only relying on so-called indigenous pesticides. The main raw materials for indigenous pesticides are plants. To mass-produce, we need large-scale planting, occupying a lot of land and manpower, and the efficacy is poor, preservation time short. From a cost perspective, it is very uneconomical. Modern improved varieties generally do not consider pests and diseases during optimization, so the demand for pesticides is particularly large. Hope the chemical sector can make breakthroughs in organic pesticides as soon as possible."

Zhan Wuya thought and said: "Chemical industry is indeed our shortcoming. To have a breakthrough, we must start with materials. Our processing technology is severely overcapacity, but materials are severely short. Speaking of the electric furnace just now, if we can succeed, the doors for chemical and power industries can basically be opened. Now Hainan has manganese, and a small tungsten mine containing a little molybdenum inside. The plan is to mine after the New Year, but we still lack too many things. Mainly chromium and nickel. Without these, we basically can't start chemical industry—whether petrochemical or coal chemical is hopeless, synthetic ammonia, pesticides are all hopeless."

"Chromium and nickel are very hard to get. Not that refining is difficult, but in the 17th century, no place has mined or refined these two metals yet: we have to build a supply chain from scratch ourselves. The key is that these two kinds of ore are hard to find domestically..."

"Isn't Landu responsible for this in the Philippines?"

"Philippines, ah. Just thinking about the difficulty of mining makes me shudder." Wu De frowned, "Tropical primeval jungle. If the ore is by the seaside, it's okay. If inland, just finding the vein alive is a miracle..."

Hainan itself had nickel and chromium reserves. The nickel ore reserves of Shilu Cobalt Copper Mine in Changhua were considered quite abundant. But they both had problems of small reserves and low grade, while mining costs were not small—typical chicken-rib resources.

"Now the Southeast Asia Company shouldn't be satisfied with trade; add more exploration and development components." Ma Jia proposed, "We want to implement mixed ownership, and the Southeast Asia Company is originally mixed ownership. I think our steps can be bigger, absorbing more private maritime merchant capital and manpower into the company, granting more autonomous operation rights. We can imitate some practices of Europeans, support and encourage adventurers to go out. Don't think about 'losing control'; with our strength, where can a little small colonial force lose control to? Fully utilize private power to find and acquire resources for us, don't intervene too much. Now we have to do everything ourselves: some are technical issues and we have to, but things like mining can completely be handed over to private capital to operate. The key is to regulate well legally."

"You really can't speak three sentences without mentioning your profession." Wu De laughed, "Making an Exploration Law or Colonial Law? By the way, your Law Society has tossed about for so many years; except for a 'Security Regulation,' 'Marriage Regulation,' and 'General Principles of Civil and Commercial Law,' not a single formal law has been formulated. Whenever a trial comes up, you pull some 'Australian Temporary Residence Precedent' to cover up; it's simply conviction by free will..."

Ma Jia blushed and argued: "Law is a very serious matter, considering all aspects. Besides, our work is not simply copying legal articles, but combining with the specific situation of this spacetime. Can't be imprudent. So-called gathering strengths of many based on full investigation and research..." Afraid everyone would question the work efficiency of the Law Society, he quickly said, "Our Law Society has finished drafting the 'Marriage Law' and 'Criminal Code,' and the draft of the 'Civil Code' is almost done. Gentlemen, don't look down on these few laws. The 'Marriage Law' contains basic contents of civil law centered on small families such as inheritance law, providing legal guarantees for us to establish a new social atmosphere. The 'Criminal Code' and 'Civil Code' prepare legal basis for us to suppress and liquidate clan powers and all kinds of demons and monsters. With these laws, we basically have the basis for governing the country according to law."

Xiao Zishan asked: "How are Senators positioned in your law?"

Ma Jia said: "The first article of every law writes: Senators are sacred and inviolable, Senators are the pillars of the state, Senators are not restricted by this law blah blah blah. All legal issues involving Senators are handled by the Senate according to the Senator Common Program."
