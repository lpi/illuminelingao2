# Chapter 1997 - Circle and Approve

Wang Qiyi lay half-reclined on the dorm bed in a sprawl, bored to death. Perhaps due to lacking the self-awareness as a "Senator," compared to Ai Zhixin who ran east and west radiating vitality, every night once training ended after shift, he would shack up in dorm not working. As for the Senator Residence specifically applied for in Great World, he was even more lazy to go.

Why be so tired? Wang Qiyi mumbled a sentence, turning over again. Hot to death, this Guangzhou summer was truly not for humans to stay. Where is the agreed Little Ice Age? In Lingao at least General Office delivered ice blocks daily; house structure considered ventilated too. Cool enough without electric fan or air conditioner. What was here? Even dorm was deep inside Finance and Tax Bureau compound, stuffy terribly. Thinking Liu Xiang and Ai Zhixin might be lying on cool couch now, maids fanning slowly aside comfortably, fire jumped in his heart. But this couldn't blame others. Who told himself to bring wife along. Neither having Liu San's courage nor Liu Zheng's boldness. Own wife was even less a "Magnanimous" housewife like Dong Weiwei.

In previous stage wife inexplicably had good feelings for Nan Wan'er, getting close and cultivating her vigorously. Director Wang thought wife changed nature, wanting to "find a sister," heart sweet. But he was long-tested after all, absolutely showing no half expression on face. Showing people as modest gentleman daily. Let you Deputy Director Zhang probe and fish in various ways, always expressing absolute no idea himself. Meanwhile constantly publishing some "Reflections" like psychologically hard to accept etc., simultaneously criticizing Director Ai fiercely as "Corrupt and Degenerate," "Playing with Women," "Moral Depravity."

During period, Deputy Director Wang also wavered, confused. Sometimes secretly suspected if missed some opportunity. But finally he persisted. Until the moment Deputy Director Zhang wrote application wanting to recognize Nan Wan'er as sister, he knew how correct his choice was—Human survival instinct triggered sixth sense was always right.

Sigh, correct is correct, this Senator's fortune couldn't be enjoyed... Director Wang tossed and turned. Thinking guards outside door were idle, how about calling them in to fan? Thinking of the picture of two brawny men sitting by bed holding fans shaking lightly fanning slowly, a stream of evil chill rushed straight to forehead.

Sigh... Just like this. Wang Qiyi sat up, shaking palm fan hard a few times as if driving away something. Days ago wife wrote letter saying application recognizing Nan Wan'er as god-sister was rejected. General Office only recognized Senators adopting children, not recognizing becoming sworn brothers sisters of opposite sex. Xiao Zishan said if insisting on forming kinship only let Nan Wan'er be their adopted daughter; recognizing sister not filed for record.

Daughter... Wang Qiyi smiled wryly. Although with their couple's age, having a daughter of Nan Wan'er's age wasn't shocking to world—in this spacetime fifteen sixteen years old girls marrying and giving birth was common. But they treated her as sister usually. Really changing mouth to call Dad Mom...

He shivered again. Though better forget it.

However since then, wife rarely mentioned her in letters. Wang Qiyi estimated wife's interest in finding an aunt for own daughter passed—This was good too. Everyone happy to be relaxed. Otherwise needing to be firm in stance daily was truly suffering...

Jokes aside, Wang Qiyi always felt Nan Wan'er was somewhat hesitant and uneasy about their "Favor." Although accepted their good will, could always feel she had some resistance in heart. Usually also maintained sense of distance faintly.

Wang Qiyi knew how many naturalized citizens with "Ambitious Heart" racked brains hoping to work beside Senators, for obtaining Senator's "Favor." As long as leaving a good impression with Senator, later if something happened Senator might mention casually and one could prosper. This girl was good; fearing being too close to own couple!

Don't know what this sister is thinking? Wang Qiyi thought about this problem.

On bedside nightstand was the summary report on Noble Gathering asset composition delivered just today. Same as Wang Qiyi predicted, after paying 10 times tax amount fine, Noble Gathering almost immediately went to re-sign land transfer contract with Zhang Company. Then Luo family up and down completely lost the tension of huge days ago.

Tsk tsk, this handwriting is beautiful. These guys are capable; changing brush to fountain pen can still write so good looking. Wang Qiyi picked up pencil on table casually, picked a simplest name from Shareholder column, tried writing a "Shi" character in front... Fuck, truly ugly. Comparing two sides, even uglier. Forget it, leader practicing signature well is enough. Doing these many for what. Wang Qiyi made up mind to change all to circle reading [draw circle to approve] in future. Drawing circles he was still confident able to draw relatively round.

The seven or eight households on list were all people with face and head in city. Picking any one out putting in past wasn't inferior to Gao Ju. These people were screened out after several discussions. Actually in the earliest report written by Li Fulai there were nearly twenty families. Due to "Various Reasons," such as listening to Liu Xiang, Zheng Shangjie etc. resident Guangzhou Senators' views on certain big households, Ai Zhixin and others ticked here and there. Finally discovered list actually shrank by more than half.

This Senate is afraid eating jujube pill [doomed]! Ai Zhixin slapped table with face full of grief and indignation at that time, completely forgetting he himself ticked off two families.

Wang Qiyi scanned the list again from beginning to end. Felt still too long. Counting fingers full calculation, usable subordinates were just five buck privates. Wanting to engage seven or eight big households. Truly treat people of this spacetime as fools? Maybe technology industry they figured not understanding no matter how, but coping with government they were old hands. No, must pick again. Wang Qiyi pinched pencil starting from first household on list stroking down slowly...

Liang Family? Since ranking first, reasonably and emotionally can't run away from you. Mm... Xu... Wang... Huo... Liang... Just you. Able to arrange advisor into Luo family, share occupied still so small. Means capable. Not checking you would be sorry for your family's fame in Senate. Two now. About enough... No must add one, otherwise that kid Ai Zhixin definitely won't agree. Shi? Wang Qiyi glanced at that ugly "Shi" character written by himself just now. Mm, just this one.

Finished drawing three circles, Wang Qiyi wrote "Discretionary Key Inspection Three Households, Submit Director Ai Zhixin for Review" with flying dragon dancing phoenix on upper right corner of list. Only then put down things in hand, grabbed palm fan and shook hard a few times again. Maybe night was deep, temperature seemed dropped. After drinking a big cup of herbal tea like ox Wang Qiyi felt whole body refreshed much. Raising hand looking at time, almost nine o'clock. Why hasn't this little girl Yao Yulan come yet? Soldiers of Political Security Bureau, dare not put Senator in eyes now?

"Report Chief, Finance and Tax Bureau Yao Yulan has matters finding you!" Guard knocked door entering, reported lowering voice.

Truly speak of Cao Cao Cao Cao arrives.

"Let her come in." Wang Qiyi put on coat while pacing to living room. From certain angles, he actually disliked this Political Security Bureau little girl in his department very much. Although he knew "Decemvirate" was internal security means approved by Senate, and indeed made outstanding contributions these years. Especially regarding who his big daughter wrote letters with, thanks to them much.

Zhao Manxiong's "Secret Police" couldn't count wrong, even in old timeline couldn't count wrong. But facing Senate this political "Freak" in new spacetime appeared somewhat unacclimatized. Wang Qiyi heard other department Senators complain more than once about feeling uncomfortable regarding question "Which unit exactly subordinate belongs to" as chief officer.

He, he was uncomfortable too. Although Director Wang knew clearly he was just a Director, coming here only to hold post, not "Going to State" to be Emperor. But he still disliked existence of so few "Loyalty Not Absolute" cadres under hand—this was also human nature.

This morning he met Wu Mu at a meeting convened by Liu Xiang. Beside him added a woman, introduced as backbone of Political Security Bureau seems named Yang Something, specially coming from Lingao to assist Wu Mu.

Theme of meeting was regarding how to strike anti-Senate underground groups in this "Stamp Tax Case." Wang Qiyi listened stunned, not knowing case hadn't entered formal investigation yet how Political Security Bureau reached this conclusion—Planning to do Unwarranted [Yue Fei's charge] or playing determine guilt first then find evidence set?

At meeting Wu Mu mentioned current financial level had "Struggle." As for specific content of struggle, he didn't say, only reminded everyone currently besides some small actions, gentry big households inside and outside Guangzhou city also had other some "Illegal Activities." He specially mentioned currently small amount of counterfeit currency was discovered in market circulation level. Specific details he didn't say, only said report would come out soon for everyone to circulate and read.

Wang Qiyi also knowingly didn't ask. Result finding Yao Yulan after dinner at night, was told: "Team Leader Yao went out, didn't say where went." This made Wang Qiyi very unhappy. Thinking with toes knew this eighty percent was "Sitting Spy" going to report work. Reporting what? We three play dereliction of duty or improper use of personnel or engaging in cliques not honest to Senate? Although required not allowed to collect Senator information, heaven knows what this bunch of guys hiding in corners recorded exactly.

"Tell her immediately go to my dorm before 9 after she comes back." Wang Qiyi exhorted hatefully. Decided next time in Senator General Assembly when Zhao Manxiong gets eye drops put on [criticized/sabotaged] again he absolutely won't support this guy anymore.

"Chief Wang, you find me." Yao Yulan face flushed, didn't know if ran all way, or other reasons.

"Mm, you take this to Director Ai." Wang Qiyi expressionless put list circled and approved by himself into file bag, sealed opening and passed to Yao Yulan.

"Yes!"

"No other matters, go."

"Yes."

"Team Leader Yao," Just when Yao Yulan stepped out door via threshold, Wang Qiyi called her to stop again. "Tomorrow may have important mission. Remember go back rest early after delivering."

Yao Yulan stunned, hesitated slightly then replied "Yes!"
