# Chapter 1676 - Agricultural On-site Stay

Ma Qianzhu thought this pettifogger was peddling his "Rule of Law" concept again, and said: "This isn't good. Even the Great Ming superficially says 'If the Prince violates the law, he is punished the same as the common people.' If you write it so clearly in the legal articles, I'm afraid it won't be justifiable."

"Director General, it should be like this. The Rule of Law must have laws to abide by to achieve the Rule of Law. We had too many ambiguous areas in the law in the past, and too much room for the use of political tactics. This is inconsistent with the spirit of the Rule of Law."

Ma Qianzhu said: "I have no objection to clarifying this with legal articles. I'm just worried whether it's appropriate to mention this sentence in every law? I think the clause on the status of Senators can be listed as a section in the Constitution, there is no need to put it in every law—speaking of which, you haven't even drafted a Constitution yet. The Common Program can only be counted as a Party Constitution, it cannot be confused with a Constitution!"

"I also think it should be like this. Otherwise, wouldn't the naturalized citizens be curious to death about the content of this Common Program? Besides, in thirty or fifty years, keeping this clause hanging there is clearly provoking naturalized citizens—inviting hatred. Even the 'Two Less, One Lenient' (fewer arrests, fewer executions, lenient treatment) which wasn't even a legal article was scolded for decades," Wu Nanhai spoke up. "If we talk about everyone being equal on one hand, and publicly declare that Senators are superior and will reign for thousands of generations on the other, this is not only schizophrenic but also gives future opposition parties a big handle. Confucius's ambiguous sentence 'Punishment does not extend to High Officials, Rituals do not descend to Commoners' has been used to scold 'Confucius the Second' endlessly. If we create a 'Senators are more equal' clause, it has no meaning other than setting up a target for naturalized citizens. In my opinion, this shouldn't even be written in the Constitution. Everyone just operate in the black box. Anyway, with the Common Program and the Honor Court setting, if a Senator really has legal problems, they won't go to ordinary courts. Why write it down?"

Finally, it was decided not to write this clause, but to write into the Constitution the lofty status of the Senate as the creator, leader, defender, and guide of the state.

Then they discussed the plan proposed by the Planning Agency to relocate some factories to Qiongshan. Bopu Port itself was not a natural good harbor, and the current cargo throughput had reached saturation status. To further increase cargo turnover, large-scale port construction would be required.

"Currently, the import of steam coal alone from Hongay reaches 120,000 tons annually, not including coking coal and imports of other bulk commodities. The phenomenon of cargo detaining ships and ports has already appeared. It is necessary to conduct a dispersal of industrial enterprises in Lingao."

Because there was already an industrial relocation plan after the capture of Guangzhou, the main dispersal was the shipyard. Except for keeping a small part of the equipment and workers of the current Bopu Shipyard to maintain ship repair and small shipbuilding capabilities, the rest would all be moved to Hong Kong Island to set up a new factory. In addition, the Lingao Glass Factory and Ceramic Factory, which consumed large amounts of coal and relied on external sources for both raw materials and products; the Paper Mill requiring large amounts of straw and water; and the Wood Processing Plant relying basically on imported raw materials would also be moved entirely to Qiongshan County.

This would not only utilize the transport capacity of Haikou Port but also reduce the non-agricultural population density of Lingao County, alleviate housing pressure, and facilitate obtaining food nearby: Qiongshan and Wenchang were both large agricultural counties.

"I have no objection to relocation, just that those factory buildings and kilns that can't be moved are a pity." Cheng Dong felt somewhat regretful.

"Actually, there's nothing to pity. Most of these kilns were makeshift, with low standards and great hidden dangers. The remaining factory buildings can be used by other factories." Zhan Wuya didn't care much, "Besides, after using them for so many years, even if their lifespan isn't up, they need major repairs. Just in time to take the opportunity of relocation for industrial upgrading."

Then they discussed some details about the Mainland Campaign, and finally, the arrangement for Senators to go to the countryside for "squatting" investigations.

"The general principle is that Senators serving in industrial and mining enterprises will not be arranged for squatting usually, mainly 'visits', ending within three days. Senators in administrative departments will be grouped for squatting social investigations, staying for a week; if they apply personally and work can be arranged, a longer time is also possible. Zishan has already made a squatting table, arranging who goes where and for how many days. Each department must also keep people on duty..." Ma Qianzhu said.

"Everyone has to go?"

"All must go. Of course, each department must arrange Senators on duty. Roughly one-fifth of the Senators are arranged to do investigations each time, and everyone takes turns." Ma Qianzhu said, "We should go down and see the real situation more, and not always be intoxicated by report numbers."

The autumn wind gradually became chilly. In Hainan during the Little Ice Age, there was thin frost in the morning when the cold wave hit. At this time, it was the stage where the busy autumn harvest was gradually coming to an end. A convoy of freight wagons—including a two-wheeled carriage dedicated to Senators—was traveling on the Lingao-Chengmai-Haikou Highway.

Doing countryside squatting investigations in this weather, with clear and refreshing weather and suitable temperature, going out for a trip and staying in the countryside for a few days, would not cause too much resistance among Senators.

Now, except for a few people, no Senators were willing to travel far in the hot summer. After all, only Lingao had ice blocks and water air conditioning. Even going out at this time, Senators assigned to distant places with few people also had complaints.

Yun Suji was very happy when he heard he was arranged to go to Qiongshan. For the past three or four years, he had been stuck in Lingao, working either on zero-distance farmland water conservancy or falling asleep to the whistle of the food factory during breaks. He hadn't even been to Haikou, so he had the idea of going to Qiongshan for investigation.

Although he was in the Ministry of Light Industry, due to the business relationship of the food factory and his concurrent job as an agricultural technician for the Tiandihui (Heaven and Earth Society), he had a deep relationship with the agriculture sector. He asked Wu Nanhai to report an investigation project, specifically inspecting the state-owned farms and immigrant production and living conditions in Haikou, and unexpectedly it was approved very smoothly.

Before leaving, he said to Wu Nanhai: "Old Wu, we still have a lot to do in Haikou."

He was referring to the blueprint for agricultural reclamation in Taiwan Island and Hainan Island carefully designed by the Ministry of Agriculture.

In history, the Hainan State Farms created in 1952 was the country's third-largest state reclamation system after the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps and Heilongjiang State Farms. With a total population of 1.05 million, including 213,000 employees, the production bases spread all over Hainan planted more than twenty kinds of tropical cash crops and famous fruits such as coconut, betel nut, pepper, coffee, sisal, cocoa, oil palm, cashew, southern medicine, lychee, longan, mango, grapefruit, jackfruit, grape, guava, and rambutan, in addition to rubber and tea.

"Right, yes, exactly. What we want is a single-crop economic belt like in the United States." Upon hearing him mention the reclamation plan, Wu Nanhai instantly became energetic.

For the agricultural department, after three years of development, they believed that the Tiandihui, which mainly improved and upgraded traditional agriculture, had matured in operation. Although the Tiandihui system had great potential, taking it to the next level required slow and patient work. Once the planning cadres could independently undertake the work, the few surviving Senators in the agricultural sector began to ponder another direction for agriculture: how to establish large-scale plantations, or essentially replicate the Hainan State Farms system.

Plantations are large-scale intensive commercial agriculture growing single cash crops in tropical regions, widely distributed in Latin America, Southeast Asia, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa in the old spacetime. Plantation agriculture often engages in large-scale production. The plantation possesses a complete set of production and living facilities. In these regions, there are many special plant resources, such as natural rubber, coffee, cocoa, tea; bananas, pineapples, mangoes; oil palm, sisal, tobacco, cotton, and jute, which occupy an important position in the world's cash crops.

The agricultural sector believed: small peasant economy can solve the food problem, but to contribute to the Senate's great cause of conquering the stars and the sea, the plantation model represents the future development direction. All plantations possess a complete set of production and living facilities, not only agricultural and transport machinery but also road systems, agricultural product processing plants, farm machinery repair shops, power and water supply, as well as education and health facilities. This complete set of facilities is something the small peasant economy cannot compete with. For the Senate, hard work to transport people to the south is not for them to continue being farmers living in rural areas, but to become human resources. Plantations are directly operated by managers and staff hired by the company, which is distinctly different from individually operated farms. What comes out of plantations are industrial workers rather than traditional farmers. Industrial workers are very useful whether for soldering or colonizing. This is also why the Human Resources Department used the agricultural sector as a human resource reserve after Operation Engine.

At the beginning of the landing, when the first commune was established at Bairen Beach, they promoted the state-owned farm model, adopting enterprise management. But due to limited conditions, until today these farms—except for a Nanhai Demonstration Farm—including the farms established later around Kaohsiung were still not large plantations meeting the standards.

In addition, because policies long advocated "enterprise specialization" and did not allow "enterprises to run society," the supporting facilities for plantations were incomplete. Although the Tiandihui was set up as a substitute, under various restrictions, the supporting facilities for state-owned farms still had a long way to go.

This was also something Wu Nanhai brooded over. This Plenary Session merged state-owned enterprises under the Planning Agency, solving the ownership problem, no longer mentioning "enterprise specialization," and especially the policy of large and small non-tradable shares after proposing "mixed ownership," which was also conducive to the agricultural sector absorbing private capital. It was a good opportunity to go big and fast.

In his view, establishing plantations on the Tainan Plain was ideal, followed by Hainan Island, especially several counties in the south where there was much land and few people, and water and heat conditions were suitable, fitting for lavish spending.

Due to limited resources, the agricultural sector had just established several large plantations in Sanya and settled 30,000 immigrants in several counties in northern Hainan with good agricultural foundations using a scattered settlement method.
