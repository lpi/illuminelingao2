# Chapter 1974 - Closing the Accounts

"Write-off" is a term frequently used in the tax system, generally referring to the confirmation of an item or document/voucher. Here, Nan Wan'er needed to hand the Remittance Receipt (i.e., the first ply of the Summary Payment Slip mentioned earlier) brought back from Delong to Xu Zhewei. After Xu Zhewei compared it with the Hall Accountant's summary report and found them consistent, he would perform write-off registration, stamp it, and bind it for preservation as a reference voucher that the tax authority had remitted tax funds. (Here Delong played the role of a commercial bank).

Having instructed Xu Zhewei's side, Zhang Xiaoqi walked to the report accountants' desks to look at the General Journal they were registering. Unlike the Hall Accountant's summary report which only had simple sub-totals for declaration and collection by tax category, the tax statistical report was much more detailed. Not only did it record tax category sub-totals separately by opening balance, current period, and current cumulative, but tax funds were also divided into states like declared, invoiced, remitted, entered treasury, and in-transit. Therefore, it required a high level of bookkeeping skills from personnel. To ensure the correctness of tax statistical reports and to realize the old-timeline-standardization of tax accounting in the future, Zhang Xiaoqi adopted the double-entry bookkeeping method, which was very challenging for Great Ming locals. In fact, this was also part of the "New Financial System" currently promoted by the Senate in Guangzhou. Especially for taxpaying households above designated size, the new system was promoted via tax collection.

However, limited by the number of personnel who could skillfully master this bookkeeping method, she gave up the step of subsidiary ledgers and recorded directly to the General Ledger. In the General Ledger, subjects like Tax Receivable, Overpaid, Temporarily Collected, To Be Collected, Reduction/Exemption, To Be Remitted, Remitted, In-Transit, and Treasury Entry were set up to account for tax funds. Tax funds just collected today had been separately registered under Tax Receivable and To Be Remitted subjects. In a while, when Xu Zhewei finished the write-off of remittance receipts, they would also be registered into the Remitted Tax Funds subject. Of course, these would all be "Tax Funds In-Transit."

Zhang Xiaoqi watched very carefully. To be honest, she wasn't very assured about these naturalized citizen cadres trained in short-term crash courses, although they were already the best tax accountants she could produce. Besides time being too short and knowledge too advanced, more importantly, she also doubted whether she herself was a competent teacher. Before transmigration, she was a computer major slacker who had never received any systematic accounting training. Her only accounting knowledge came from two books she read because she needed to pass the accounting certificate exam for work back then; purely relying on continuous experience accumulation in work.

"It seems future accounting personnel still need to be selected from the finance class," Zhang Xiaoqi pondered.

At this moment, a sharp whistle sounded, signaling the end of the work day. Limited by Lingao's clock industry production capacity, transmigrators couldn't yet equip every office of subordinate agencies and enterprises with clocks. So in Lingao, steam whistles and broadcasts were used, while in Guangzhou, whistles were used.

"Everyone go eat. We'll continue when we come back in the evening."

At the cafeteria entrance, Zhang Xiaoqi met a red-faced Ai Zhixin. Upon hearing Zhang Xiaoqi say that tax collection and remittance went smoothly, Ai Zhixin's joy increased a notch. Obviously, Director Ai had encountered something happy, but since he didn't say, Zhang Xiaoqi couldn't be bothered to ask. It wasn't until she got her food and sat next to Wang Qiyi that she realized her husband was a bit unhappy today.

"What's wrong? It went very smoothly today; why the long face?"

"Ai Zhixin went to the Harbor Treasury today."

"Oh, I know. Isn't that the one preparing to be the National Treasury next? He didn't let you go, so you feel left out?" Zhang Xiaoqi was a bit baffled; her husband didn't seem like such an ambitious person.

"Am I that kind of person? I just feel a bit awkward. Look, Ai Zhixin is the Finance and Tax Bureau Director now. He issues money with his left hand and collects money with his right. The basic principle of separate lines for revenue and expenditure is already ruined. Later if he also manages the National Treasury, then revenue, expenditure, and storage will all be in one person's hands. It's really..."

"I don't think Ai Zhixin is that kind of person. He's quite energetic and ambitious. Besides, we are all transmigrators; what do we need to steal money for? Even if planning for people around him, he doesn't need to do it personally. Just a few days ago you educated me to correct my attitude that this is the 17th century. I think you are the stubborn one holding onto the old ways. Aren't we just starting out? Expedient measures for urgent matters."

"Uh... alright. I was just worried this brother is taking on too big a spread, the risk... forget it, I'm worrying over nothing." Wang Qiyi shook his head. "Let's not talk about this. Are you really working overtime today? Isn't doing it tomorrow the same? Anyway, normally these are jobs for accountants on the next day."

"No, I have to finish it in one go. I'll only be at ease when it's tidied up. You go straight home after training; I don't know till what time I'll be here."

Early next morning, just as Nan Wan'er and the others finished cleaning and pushed open the Tax Collection Hall doors, Xu Zhewei had already returned from the Reserve Bank in a Red Flag carriage with the first day's Tax Treasury Entry Receipt (Summary Payment Slip 4th ply, actually still issued by Delong, just not using Delong letterhead) and the Treasury Daily Reconciliation Sheet. Returning to the office, he and Li Hongyu first separately did write-off registration for the Entry Receipts, then verified the Tax-Treasury Daily Reconciliation. After matching, they transferred both receipts and reconciliation sheets to the report accountants for bookkeeping processing.

Days passed quickly, and the Guangzhou Municipal Finance and Tax Bureau's first tax collection period soon passed. Whether it was the wide broadcast of the transmigrators' prestige or the Great Ming locals having much higher tax paying consciousness than old timeline common folks, the tax collection work went smoothly and flatly. How to put it? According to Zhang Xiaoqi, it was even smoother than in the old timeline: in her past experience, every collection period always had a few difficult taxpayers. But this time there wasn't a single one—not even one who questioned.

Of course, a major reason was the high proportion of "sensible people" among this first batch of taxpayers. Another reason was that many big households didn't understand the new tax system; they just viewed this tax collection as a new trick of "accumulation" by the new masters, coming with the idea of spending money to buy peace.

Wait until the system is straightened out in the next step, work is fully rolled out, and collection coverage expands further—such a harmonious picture between collectors and taxpayers might not exist anymore. But regardless, since the collection work ended successfully, the compilation of tax reports was put on the agenda.

The Guangzhou Municipal Finance and Tax Bureau Tax Statistics Division re-verified the General Journal on the day after the collection period ended, and after confirming no errors, closed the accounts (i.e., period-end closing), then began compiling the Q1 Tax Statistical Report. The tax report is the reflection of the final result of the entire tax business and the most direct tool for grasping the tax situation. No matter how solid the preliminary management work or how detailed the collection work, in the eyes of leaders, nothing compares to this report. It could be said that whether Liu Xiang, Cheng Dong, or even Wu De and the Supervisor, what they wanted to see, what they wanted, was this report. The entire result of their busy half-year was actually embodied in this report.

Zhang Xiaoqi knew the logic deeply, so she didn't even go to the hall in the morning and buried herself in the Tax Statistics Division. With the barely perfect General Ledger, the compilation of the Cent-level Table basically encountered no major obstacles. In the afternoon, Zhang Xiaoqi got the first "draft." She was happy, very happy. Although this report was just an A3 paper and the content was crude, it meant the transmigrators' tax work had successfully completed all basic links, and also meant the modern tax system could be used in the new timeline.

She ran excitedly with the table to find Wang Qiyi, partly to show off to her husband, and partly to hear his suggestions for improvement. After all, the audience of this report was mainly those "leaders" who didn't understand the business much, and Wang Qiyi had been seconded as a deputy director at a county bureau for two years in the old timeline, so he was relatively familiar with these guys' thinking.

After listening to his wife's excited explanation, Wang Qiyi seriously turned the report over and looked at it twice. After flattering her with even more "serious" attitude, he gave his only suggestion—compile a Wan-level Table (Ten-Thousand-Unit Table).

Although the current report lacked many details, it was harmless; as long as key data was there, it was basically qualified. But looking at rows and columns of tiny fly-head numbers was truly uncomfortable. Besides, for someone like Liu Xiang's level, he wouldn't care about a one-cent discrepancy, nor did he need such detailed figures for decision-making. So, to show leaders, a clean and clear tax statistical report in units of ten thousand was mandatory.

"Okay, I'll go do it right now. With the Cent-level Table, the rest is fast."

"Are you sure?" Wang Qiyi was an old tax hand after all and knew the problems inside, but his wife was full of confidence, so he didn't want to point it out directly.

"I'll give it to you before off-work."

However, Zhang Xiaoqi miscalculated again. She forgot again that she was in the 17th century without computers. After rounding the cent-level data, the numbers in the Wan-level Table didn't balance. The cross-check relations of every row were wrong; totals of every column didn't match. To balance these—which number to add one to, which to subtract one from—was the responsibility of old accountants even in the old timeline. She and her bunch of raw recruits tossed and turned until off-work without sorting it out.

"Let them all go back; don't work overtime. They calculated all day; let these children rest." At off-work time, Wang Qiyi said to Zhang Xiaoqi whose brain was a mess of paste. "Time isn't urgent. Ai Zhixin notified me that the meeting is next week."

Hearing her husband say this, Zhang Xiaoqi had even less confidence and planned to go to Meng Xian tomorrow to coordinate a few old accountants to balance it. This idea was firmly stopped by Wang Qiyi: "If you don't trust them, they will never be able to hold up the burden. Anyway, there's the Cent-level Table as a base, and we don't really understand it either. Just let them do it."

Facts proved Wang Qiyi's idea was correct. Just one day later, the girls of the Tax Statistics Division produced a very beautiful Q1 Tax Statistical Wan-level Report.
