# Chapter 1685 - Symposium

Fan Twelve saw that there was a hidden meaning in the Chief's words, yet his face was full of smiles, and knew the situation was bad. Seeing four personal guards standing at the courtyard gate, if the Chief shouted "Take him down!", he would have to carry his luggage to dig sand. He couldn't help but sweat hot and cold at the same time. He hemmed and hawed for half a day without uttering a single word, but his body began to tremble involuntarily.

It was the village accountant who had a quick mind. He hurriedly said, "Village Head Fan is having a malaria attack right now and can't speak clearly. Let me speak."

Yun Suji asked, "You are..."

"I am the village accountant, Han Daoguo." The accountant stood up, bowing and scraping.

"Oh, the accountant." Yun Suji knew that in grassroots organizations, although the accountant wasn't an official, he was a key figure. Cadres relied on him to do work well, and also relied on him to play tricks. His understanding of the village's basic situation was much deeper than ordinary cadres. Seeing this accountant's style, he was probably from a background like a shop assistant, speaking the new language with a southern accent, so he said, "Alright, let's hear you speak."

"Yes, Chief!" Han Daoguo bowed, cleared his throat, "Our village is a model village in the county. This is all due to the good leadership of the Senate, the county, and the township..." He looked at Yun Suji's expression and quickly got to the main topic, "Speaking of problems, there are quite a few. Currently, everyone's biggest complaint is that there is too much corvée labor."

"How much is too much?"

Han Daoguo took out a small notebook from his pocket, licked his finger to turn a few pages, and said: "Reporting to the Chief: take last month for example, our village contributed a total of 1,566 labor days. Last month was still the busy farming season, so assigned labor was less. If it were ordinary times, it would be over 2,000 labor days!"

Yun Suji calculated in his heart. The village had 192 full laborers. That is to say, last month, on average, every full laborer contributed more than 8 days of labor. If ordinary months exceeded 2,000 labor days, it would be more than 10 days. That meant even in the busy farming season, laborers in this village had to contribute 2 days of labor per week. And in ordinary times, it would reach a level of nearly 3 days per week.

Yun Suji had read political economic history, which discussed exploitation through corvée labor by peasants for landlords in serfdom manors. generally, 3 days a week was a threshold. Exceeding 3 days was basically "making life impossible for the people." Moreover, according to the understanding from chatting with villagers earlier, there was unfair distribution of labor here. Some people evaded labor duties, so their share would inevitably fall on other villagers, and the burden would be far more than this number. It was normal for farmers to have complaints.

He nodded slightly and said, "It is a bit much!"

Seeing he had no objection, Han Daoguo became bolder and said: "As for this month, it counts as the slack winter season—actually, Chief, you also saw it, it's not that slack—a notice from the county transferred half of our village's laborers to the construction site, going for a whole month."

"Excluding winter slack and busy farming seasons, how much corvée labor on average per month?"

"Around two thousand."

Yun Suji took out a fountain pen and noted down the data in his notebook. He asked again:

"What about the content of the service?"

"We do everything. Repairing water conservancy and building roads are the bulk." Han Daoguo said, "Planting trees, unloading cargo, transporting wood, digging sand, taking soil... as long as it's physical work, we get assigned."

"Where do the assignments come from? What procedures do they go through?"

Fan Twelve was calmer by now and hurriedly came up to reply: "The county assigns, the township also assigns, and also from the mine. The procedure is just sending a notice."

Yun Suji knew "the mine" was the Jiazi Coal Mine, a state-owned enterprise directly under the Planning Committee. This mine now not only supplied low-quality lignite to Lingao but also transported a large amount of mining by-products like coal gangue to Qiongshan to be processed into building materials. Typical cargo throughput was large.

"What about the counterpart department? Which department issues the slips?"

"In the county, it's the County Human Resources Section. In the township, the township government just issues a note stamped with the official seal and that's it." Fan Twelve said, "At the mine, the mine office issues a note. Once the notice arrives, people must be arranged. It won't do not to go."

Yun Suji thought this was too casual, a typical abuse of civilian power.

"Are meals provided for corvée labor?"

"Meals are provided. It's just hard on clothes." Fan Twelve said, "One set of clothes gets worn out after one trip to the construction site. Now for county labor, the county gives some subsidy, which can somewhat make up for it."

"Have there been any accidents during corvée labor?"

Fan Twelve hesitated for a moment and said: "Yes..."

"How many casualties? Any disabled?"

"One died, three act disabled." Fan Twelve quickly said, "The county gave compensation. Life is passable."

"Can the disabled work?" Yun Suji said, "What arrangements does the village have for them?"

This put Fan Twelve in a difficult spot. He stammered: "Arrangements... there are always some..."

Han Daoguo hurriedly took over and said: "For these few families, the village made the decision to arrange people to farm on their behalf. During holidays, the village supplements with some grain and cloth. Life is passable. We definitely won't let them freeze or starve."

Yun Suji felt such arrangements were acceptable, but Fan Twelve's vague words made him suspicious of Han Daoguo's statement. He decided to visit these households later.

At this time, a group head boldly stood up and said tremblingly: "Chief..."

Seeing it was an old man, Yun Suji said: "Grandpa, sit down and speak, sit down and speak."

"Thank you, Chief." The group head said, "Corvée labor, we accept it. Tighten up a bit, and we can still finish the work in the fields in time. But now there are various tricks..."

"What tricks?"

The old man glanced at Fan Twelve and said: "First is night school. People are sent from the county to 'eliminate illiteracy.' Classes at night. Literacy is a good thing, but everyone works all day and has to go to work the next day; everyone wants to sleep early. But everyone must go—learning from lighting the lamp until the first watch. It's fine for children, but for an old man like me, can't I be spared..."

"Oh, what else?"

"There are too many various study classes," the old man said. "My son spends seven or eight days a month studying and meeting in the county. Farm work at home can't be finished, tiring his wife into sickness. Going to meetings is worse than corvée labor—corvée labor provides meals, but going to study and meet requires bringing one's own pancakes!"

"What work does your son do?"

"He is the village's Tiandihui liaison."

Yun Suji nodded and turned to ask Fan Twelve: "Are there many people in the village who often go to meetings and training?"

"Originally not many, recently the county organized village children for training. Mostly fourteen or fifteen-year-olds. Batch after batch, gone for half a month or a month."

Fourteen or fifteen-year-old children, regardless of gender, counted as half a laborer in the countryside. Going away for half a month or a month was indeed a loss for family labor.

Yun Suji asked the old man to sit down. Then someone mentioned there were many disguised forms of corvée labor: making military shoes and washing/remaking old military uniforms was one; collecting castor beans was one; preparing meals for troops and laborers, calling women to make pancakes was another. There was also annual militia training, etc., numerous and varied.

"We really work all year round, busy from the moment we open our eyes, and when we go to sleep, a pile of corvée labor awaits." The group heads complained one after another, "The common people are not willing, but the county and township press hard; it won't do not to do it!"

Seeing the Chiefs talking to the group heads, Fan Twelve said "I'm going to relieve myself" and walked out of the yard. He didn't go to pee, but called Liu Yuanhu who was "maintaining order" outside and said: "Yuanhu! Hurry to those families who had accidents and prepare! Get them good clothes to wear, fill the grain stash, and tell them not to talk nonsense! Maybe the Chief will go look in a while!"

Liu Yuanhu agreed, then said: "The other families are easy to handle, what about the Cao family? That old hag has always been against us and definitely won't speak agreeably."

Fan Twelve said: "Find a place to lock her up first. When the time comes, just say she went out to visit relatives, right? Anyway, there are no other people in her family."

Liu Yuanhu was about to go when Fan Twelve stopped him again: "Remind the neighboring families a bit, don't talk nonsense! Also, you have to attend to the families who rented these families' land: don't say rent, say substitute farming. After harvesting grain, only share thirty percent as a hard work fee! The rest is given to the original owner. Understood? Don't say it wrong!"

"I know!" Liu Yuanhu agreed and hurriedly left.

Fan Twelve made sure Liu Yuanhu was briefed, returned to the yard, and heard Yun Suji smilingly ask: "You are a grain household? I originally wanted to find a few grain households to talk to. Getting rich is a good example."

Fan Twelve saw the person Yun Suji was speaking to was Bai Putin, and his heart settled by more than half. Old Bai was not only very "tactful" but also very cautious usually; he wouldn't talk nonsense.

"Supreme Dao Jewel Heavenly Worthy!" Bai Putin was a believer of the New Taoism. He was devoted to this religion that saved him from the death line and sent him to the "Blessed Land." Serious speech always carried such a phrase. "In this place of Hainan, the world is peaceful, and it is easier to make a living and get rich. This is all due to the fortune of the Senate."

"How many people in your family? How much land do you farm?"

"Replying to the Chief, the family has a wife, two sons, and two daughters. We farm more than two hundred mu of land, eighty mu was distributed by the Senate, and the rest was cleared by asking the Tiandihui. I also cleared a few mu myself."

"Your family is flourishing." Yun Suji nodded. "How old are the children?"

"The eldest son is twenty, the youngest son is seventeen. The eldest daughter is thirteen, and there is a little daughter born after arriving in Hainan, only two years old..." Bai Putin sighed as he spoke, "Originally there was a younger son, who died on the road with my old mother when fleeing."

Yun Suji nodded. No wonder he could get rich: the three males in the family were all strong laborers. The daughter could also count as half a laborer. The wife could still bear children, so she probably wasn't too old. There was no burden of elderly people in the family.

"Has your son taken a wife?"

"Asked someone to arrange a match. Right now, we just harvested the grain and money is tight, so we can't bring out the full betrothal gifts. We placed a deposit first. After selling grain and local products, she will come over after the first lunar month."
