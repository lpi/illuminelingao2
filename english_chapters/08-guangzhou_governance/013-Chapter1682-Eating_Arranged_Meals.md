# Chapter 1682 - Eating Arranged Meals

Yun Suji said, "Have you implemented the arranged meal system? Let's do the arranged meal. Remember, I want to be sent to a villager's home, not eat at a cadre's home. By the way, you are all from Shandong here, right? Just cook according to Shandong habits, no need to specially cook rice."

The village head agreed, but not trusting others, he went to arrange it himself. One of the Chief's soldiers followed closely behind him: this was to ensure the food safety of the Chief.

While Yun Suji was waiting to meet the group heads of each Jia, the village head went door to door to arrange things:

"Zhao Xinjia's family, arranged meal today. Kill a chicken at your house, quick."

"What? Where to send it when it's done? You woman, send it to the Number One Family."

"Liu Chuan's family, arranged meal today. Cook fish at your house. Don't think I don't know you were fishing in the river water; your third son just walked past with a fish basket bare-bottomed. Take good live fish, or watch your skin. Send it to the Number One Family when done."

"Cai Pi, go to your uncle's place, gather the porcelain from their few households, and send it to the Number One Family. Official reception."

Then he explained to the big soldier following him: The Number One Family is a designated household for arranged meals in this village. He didn't trust other families.

Who knew this soldier said: "Chief's safety comes first. We cannot send food casually, nor use the tableware here. It must be prepared in one house."

"Good heavens, how can we make it in time."

"Just do as told. I see that family in front, with some dried fish hanging in front of the door, just that family. I looked just now, it's cleaned up neatly. As for ingredients, they can't be used casually either, make it simpler. I want to supervise the whole process."

The village head looked at the family he pointed to: "Bad."

That soldier had already walked in on his own. The village head had to follow in: "Kong Xiaode, arranged meal at your house today." Saying this, he glared fiercely at the head of the household.

The head of this household was also from Shandong. There were only him and his wife at home. The Kong family had never practiced this system. Firstly, they didn't understand that this kind of managed meal was just cooking on behalf of someone and they would receive money after eating; they thought it was the same as being assigned corvée labor or levies. Secondly, they didn't know that home-cooked food was fine; they thought people from the government must eat good food. Since he thought this way, he made a big deal out of it. Seeing the big soldier look around after entering the house, and then opening the grain cabinet and rice vat to check carefully, he was even more flustered.

Because this family had few laborers and didn't harvest much grain, and they weren't used to eating unpolished rice, their usual daily meals were coarse grain pancakes with some scallion sauce. If they wanted a change, it would be coarse grain steamed buns. The head of the household thought that neither of these was presentable. Making flatbreads would be good food, but he didn't have white flour, so he had to go to a neighbor's house to borrow a ladle of whole wheat flour and told his wife to knead the dough. He also fished out a few eggs from his own chicken coop, saw that there wasn't a drop of oil at home, and had to go to a neighbor's house to borrow some sesame oil.

Yun Suji took the guards to the Kong family to eat. He saw a winnowing fan of neatly arranged flatbreads on the square table in the main room, and a coarse glazed clay pot filled with unpolished rice porridge. In the center was a plate of scrambled eggs with dried shrimp. Around it were four small dishes: pickled mustard tuber strips, mixed cucumber with sauce, pickled chive flowers, and fermented bean curd.

One look and he knew they were treating him as a guest; wheat flour was a rare item in Lingao. It was probably specially instructed by the village head when arranging the meal. He washed his hands and sat down. The householder Kong Xiaode poured a bowl of cloudy wine and offered it to Yun Suji respectfully with both hands:

"Please eat, Chief. In our poor family, there's nothing good to eat. Drink a mouthful of sugarcane wine!"

The more polite he was, the more uncomfortable Yun Suji felt. While accepting it, he said, "I'll serve myself! Sigh, fellow villager! It's right for us to eat from the same pot, why cook separately?"

"To tell you the truth, Chief, we didn't prepare food originally. We've harvested the rice and are about to rest for the winter. We originally don't eat lunch," Kong Xiaode said.

Kong's wife continued, "Chief! There's nothing, just a few dishes of cold vegetables! Not even a meat dish! If we were back home, we couldn't even put this meal together for New Year! Only after coming to Hainan Island the year before last could we scrape these together!"

Yun Suji nodded, feeling that this family was very sensible. He sat down and ate and drank slowly with the four guards. The Kong family stood by to serve. Yun Suji couldn't stand it and insisted they sit down. The couple couldn't refuse, so they dragged bamboo stools and sat on the side.

While eating, Yun Suji asked, "You still eat two meals a day?"

"Isn't it still two meals? During the busy farming season, we eat three meals. It takes effort, can't hold up without eating more." Kong Xiaode took out dry tobacco, then put it away.

"It doesn't matter, just smoke. I also like to take a few puffs."

Kong Xiaode filled the tobacco leaf, bowed, "Please bear with me, sir." He took a match, scratched it on the sole of his shoe, and lit the pipe bowl.

Seeing that his expression was less tense, Yun Suji asked, "Does everyone in the village eat two meals?"

Kong Xiaode said, "Doesn't everyone still eat two meals!"

Yun Suji said, "It seems life is just average."

Kong Xiaode didn't know what his words meant. He took a puff of smoke first, then slowly said, "Nowadays, we can eat three meals during the busy farming season, some thin and some dry, and we even have white rice to eat. In the past, I really didn't dare to dream about it! Back home these past few years, we couldn't even eat proper grain. During the spring famine, even small grain potential households had to gnaw on wowotou (steamed corn bread)." Speaking of the past, a bitter expression appeared on his face.

Yun Suji suddenly stood up, walked to the stove, and uncovered a bamboo hat. Sure enough, underneath was a pancake stack. Although he wasn't from Shandong, he was very familiar with the customs of Shandong commoners: they mostly made many pancakes at once and put them in a pancake stack to eat slowly.

The pancake stack was eighty percent full; it looked like the grain reserves were abundant.

Kong Xiaode panicked and quickly stood up: "Chief, Chief..."

Yun Suji disregarded everything, picked up a pancake, returned to the table, broke off a piece, picked up some shredded shepherd's purse, and ate in big mouthfuls.

The pancake was sour, and the coarse texture indicated that the ratio of sweet potato flour inside was quite high. He chewed for a long time before swallowing, then drank a mouthful of porridge.

"This is coarse food for farm people," Kong Xiaode said quickly, "Don't let it hurt your teeth, sir! If it's not enough, we'll bake more flatbreads."

"It doesn't matter. If you can eat it, why can't I?" Yun Suji said with a smile, "Just right for a change of taste, trying something fresh."

Kong Xiaode didn't know where the Chief came from. What was so delicious about this coarse grain pancake? He remembered the village head glaring at him and didn't dare to say much, only smiling apologetically continuously.

As they were talking, a little girl came to the door of the room. She looked only five or six years old, with two braids, wearing a coarse cloth jacket. Watching them eat flatbreads, she put a finger in her mouth, drooling, with a greedy look on her face.

Yun Suji found it interesting and called to her: "Come in."

After calling a few times, the girl didn't dare to come in. Kong Xiaode said: "Hei Ni, come in. The Chief is calling you."

Hei Ni was probably quite familiar with the Kong family and came in after hearing his words. Seeing that although she was a bit dark, her features were regular and she was chubby and very cute, Yun Suji couldn't help but think of his own daughter. He took a flatbread from the table and gave it to her, saying, "Hei Ni, eat it."

The girl still didn't dare to take it. Kong Xiaode said again: "The Chief gave it to you, just take it and eat."

Only after he said this did Hei Ni take it. She stood by the table staring with her black eyes, looking at this one and then that one, extremely cute. Yun Suji teased her while asking: "Is this your child?"

Kong Xiaode sighed: "How would I have this fortune? This is the daughter of neighbor Old Yang—when she got on the ship, she was bare-bottomed, as thin as a skeleton, just one breath away. But finally, she still had a breath!" Saying this, he puffed on his pipe again. Yun Suji saw tears in his eyes and knew it had triggered his sad memories.

While they were talking, Old Yang came to find Kong Xiaode. Entering the door, he ran into Yun Suji and his own daughter. Seeing the big leader eating with relish and Hei Ni also eating along, he was startled. He first bowed to Yun Suji, then scolded Hei Ni: "You little corpse! Why did you run here to scavenge for food!" Saying this, he raised his hand to hit her.

Yun Suji hurriedly stopped him: "What are you doing? Children are greedy, what does eating a few mouthfuls matter?" Saying this, he said to Hei Ni again, "Eat, don't be afraid. I have more here."

This Old Yang then said to the head of the Kong family: "Old Kong! Everyone else has applied ammonia water to their grain. My son has been pulled out for corvée labor again. Could you please help me apply ammonia water this afternoon?"

Kong Xiaode said: "I have to apply ammonia water in the afternoon too!"

Old Yang said: "Then I can help too. Do yours first, come late, and go do mine later, that works too!"

Yun Suji asked: "Old Yang, what corvée labor is your son doing?"

Old Yang said: "The organization sent him to the reservoir construction site to repair canals. Every family must send at least one strong laborer. I only have one son. If he goes, I'm the only one doing farm work."

Yun Suji said: "Even if you only have one son, he's assigned corvée labor?"

Old Yang said: "Who cares if you have one son or several sons? If they tell you to go, you go. Otherwise, they say you are 'anti-production' and 'dragging the feet.' Getting tie up by the militia to dig sand is something I can't bear. Anyway, these old bones can still toss about. I'll just ask neighbors for help to cope. Nowadays, life is peaceful and having a mouthful of rice to eat is considered not bad."

Kong Xiaode felt something was inappropriate and winked at Old Yang. But Old Yang happened to be a talkative person, and once he started talking, he couldn't stop. "Don't say there are no strong laborers, even if the family only has women, they still call you to go to the construction site. Last winter, Chief Du insisted on making some 'Thousand Women Embankment,' asking each village to send women to the construction site, saying something like 'women can hold up half the sky.' Specifically calling women to repair the embankment, never heard of since the beginning of the world. It's easy for Southern barbarian women—they don't bind their feet from childhood, a big pair of natural feet. Our women are half-crippled even after unbinding their feet. Being able to go down to the fields is already good, yet they have to carry heavy loads! It doesn't matter if they go, but every household in the village has cut off smoke and fire, and the whole family has nothing to eat or drink! The work on the construction site is heavy too. After a few days, some hurt their muscles and bones, some vomit blood from exhaustion. Goodness, when they come back, they need people to serve them! —I don't know what this Chief Du was thinking."

Yun Suji lost his smile. This "Thousand Women Embankment" was a water conservancy project personally grasped by Du Wen. The Executive Committee approved it at the time because they felt the symbolic significance was great and manpower was indeed needed for infrastructure. He didn't expect it to be such a situation!
