# Chapter 2020 - Beginning of a New Life

"...Take the Qingjie Institute for example. In thirty years, I've lost count of how many chaste widows lived here. Sure, a few managed to endure until their children grew up to take them out for a peaceful old age; but what about most of them? For ten, twenty years, all they saw when opening their eyes was the square patch of sky above the courtyard. Counting the hours every day, waiting for darkness, suffering through the days until they couldn't endure anymore, carried out and sent to the cremation ground—that was the end of a life. I went along every time to handle matters at the cremation ground. Watching these perfectly fine women being locked up here until they died... what was the point of it all..."

Speaking to this point, tears welled up in his own eyes. Mao Xiuyu wiped the corners of his eyes and laughed, "Ashamed, ashamed." He continued: "This time everyone has a future. I see Director Lu and Comrade Lu here, their hearts are filled with joy—as happy as if everyone were their own family..." At these words, Lu Cheng couldn't stop her tears from rolling down: after spending so much effort and suffering so much hardship in the Jiliang Institute, hearing Mao Xiuyu's words now filled her with mixed emotions and a deep sense of understanding.

"So I say, everyone is blessed!" he said. "Today is a joyous day, don't cry. Your good days are long ahead... I toast you all!"

Sister Zhen picked up her luggage and followed the group out of the Huanghua Temple's main gate.

The afternoon sun was brilliant, almost blinding, warming her body. She looked up at the mountain gate with its replaced plaque—in fifteen years, this was her second time passing through here. The first time, she carried her one-year-old son on her back, following the managing woman here, slipping with every step on the muddy ground after rain, walking all the way from the city. She still remembered the weather was just as good that day, but her heart was shrouded in gloom: her husband dead, family destitute, carrying a one-year-old son. With no way out, she listened to others' advice and came here to keep chastity.

Once here, it was a full fifteen years. In fifteen years, except for the time she cried her eyes dry carrying her son's small body to the back for cremation, she had never stepped out of the Qingjie Institute's main gate—let alone this Huanghua Temple mountain gate. Manager Sister-in-law Sun once proudly said there had been a chaste widow in the Qingjie Institute who hadn't stepped out for fifty years.

Sister Zhen never thought she could leave here alive—her son was dead, her last hope shattered. Only when dead and sent to the Liuhua Bridge cremation ground would she be carried out from here.

Days in the courtyard were endlessly long, every moment felt like suffering, yet also fast as lightning. In a blink, she had stayed here fifteen years. When the Australians fought their way in, more than half of the widows present when she entered were no longer of this world.

Bitterness... this was the word widows chanted year-round. Not having enough to eat, spinning yard day and night—these were bitter, but endurable. The true bitterness was the hopeless future, not knowing one's destiny. Do I really have to live here until death? Sister Zhen asked herself more than once before sleep. Many women probably asked too. Some couldn't endure the depression and went mad; others simply hung a skirt sash on the tree behind the house to liberate themselves.

Many believed in Buddha, chanted sutras, prayed for the next life. Sister Zhen learned chanting from an old sister too, but it couldn't relieve the bitterness in her chest at all. How long would these boundless dreary days last? Sometimes she felt death would be better—only death could liberate her from this boundless sea of bitterness.

Unexpectedly, she really escaped the sea of bitterness. She gazed greedily at the world outside the mountain gate, feeling reborn.

The sisters around her also stopped one by one before the mountain gate, gazing bewilderedly at the outside world, afraid to take a step—they had been away from this world for too long.

"Don't space out, hurry up, the scheduled boat won't wait. Watch your steps." Lu Cheng, responsible for escorting them to Lingao, urged upon seeing this.

Another group of women carrying luggage emerged from the other side of the mountain gate—these were the "students" preparing to go to Guangzhou city. Compared to the "chaste widows," they were much livelier, chattering non-stop along the way, faces full of cheerful smiles.

Lu Cheng maintained order while urging everyone to walk faster. Suddenly she noticed two people in cadre uniforms by the mountain gate looking very familiar. Looking closely, it was Wang Jun and Du Yibin, standing in the shadows of the corner, invisible if not noticed.

She was surprised and about to speak when she saw Wang Jun press a finger to his lips in a "shush" gesture. Lu Cheng had to remain silent.

They had heard today was the departure day for the women and came specially to see them off. However, at the mountain gate, Wang Jun changed his mind:

"Let's not go in."

Du Yibin didn't understand: "We're here already, why not go in?"

"Going in means just another speech, then everyone shouting 'Long live the Council of Elders.' Getting a bit tired of it." Wang Jun smiled. "We don't covet those 'Long lives.'"

"But how will this show the Council cares for them..."

"They'll definitely remember our care," Wang Jun said. "Even long after we die, someone will remember."

"So go back?"

"Since we're here, let's watch them leave. Consider it our last regard."

So they stood silently in the corner, watching the women line up and leave. Compared to when they first came here, the spiritual outlook of both "single women" and "students" had undergone earth-shaking changes. Wang Jun suddenly thought: prostitutes and chaste widows, two terms as incompatible as fire and water, groups with completely no intersection, yet at this moment both were embarking on new lives under the Council of Elders' grace and blessing. What a wondrous thing. Nothing made Wang Jun feel the absurdity more than this. Yet he secretly felt happy—how many people had we saved from the quagmire of fate? Coming to this timeline, obtaining status and wealth unimaginable in the old timeline, yet this psychological satisfaction was incomparable to any status or wealth. Perhaps precisely because of this, the Council of Elders could endure so many years of toil, loneliness, and danger. Pushing the wheel of history forward step by step.

He suddenly noticed Du Yibin wiping his eyes and laughed: "What? Happy to have sand in your eyes?"

"No, not that, don't talk nonsense." Du Yibin put down his handkerchief. "I'm happy! It's been almost eight years since D-Day, and this is the first time I'm so happy. Never felt what I did was so meaningful—actually I started just wanting to find wives for workers—now I understand: I know why I came here."

Wang Jun thought, isn't it the same for me? Responding to Du Yibin's memo back then was just to brush up some presence within the Council. Yet at this moment, what did that bit of presence matter?

Neither Lu Cheng, nor Sister Zhen, nor any other woman heard their conversation or knew their inner thoughts. They walked briskly, stepping onto the road to a new life.

Fang Fei held the document in his hand with a wry smile on his face.

Since planning and hosting the "Public Memorial Ceremony" last time, it was his turn to organize the "Collective Wedding" this time.

Generally, weddings are felt to be better than funerals—at least festive. But this collective wedding was a typical "cook the meal without rice" job. When Liu Xiang discussed the project with him, the core was "must be good yet economical," lecturing on the collective wedding's significance to the "New Life Movement," benefits for women's liberation, and various propaganda benefits... so it must be grand and give Guangzhou citizens a "fresh look"; but later repeatedly emphasized "tight budget" and frugal management.

In the eyes of veteran planner Fang Fei, holding events always meant results proportionate to money spent. Wanting great results with no money would eventually turn into something nondescript.

Moreover, available technical conditions in the 17th century were limited; many common methods for domestic large-scale events couldn't be used—they didn't even have the most old-fashioned method of hanging colored light bulbs.

Guangzhou had no electricity, nor Lingao's public lighting system. Nighttime event lighting became a major problem. The wedding couldn't be held at night, so it had to be during the day. As for the so-called "Pearl River Night Cruise" and fireworks—boats and fireworks were relatively easy to solve. White Swan Pond had many luxury pleasure boats, mostly from brothels. due to the cleanup of the vice industry, many brothels were closed and boats confiscated, transferred to the Zi Ming Lou Entertainment Company. Getting Zi Ming Lou to provide a few boats for free use wasn't a problem, but the 21st-century Pearl River night cruise relied on coastal nightscape lighting. The 17th-century White Swan Pond surroundings had no myriad lit homes; past wealthy people cruising at night mostly drank and listened to music for pleasure. When it's pitch black, what can newlyweds see on the boat? Security issues were also hard to solve.

Fang Fei wanted to cut this item, but Director Liu specifically mentioned the "water cruise" project when assigning the task, so he naturally couldn't kill it. After much thought, only daytime worked. Just as the Plaid Skirt Club bigwigs insisted on "performing," why not hold a waterside public performance at the Great World pier for the newlyweds to watch? It would count as "propagating the new literary situation." As for snacks on the cruise ships, Zhang's Food could sponsor them, and drink costs could also be covered by them.

But what about the daytime wedding banquet? Although Liu Xiang said "no gluttony," in the 17th century where most people didn't have enough to eat, a wedding focusing only on ritual and mood couldn't leave a deep impression on the masses. Instead, it would give commoners the view that "the Council of Elders is mean to subordinates, unwilling even to host a banquet for weddings."
