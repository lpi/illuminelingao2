# Chapter 1696 - Excerpt from Rural Notes (Continued)

I am very interested in these authentic "local texts." Seeing the activities of the Red and White Council, I remembered that this council was jointly promoted by the Catholic Church of Lingao and the New Daoism. Being very interested in this, I asked about the work of this council.

Old Huo said the Red and White Council had indeed done a lot of things, especially the "Australian Rites" they promoted in the village. Because the scene was solemn and the cost was not high, it had become increasingly popular among villagers recently. Asking about the specific methods, it turned out the council adopted a believer volunteer system. Catholic and New Daoist believers in each village would provide volunteer labor when there were weddings or funerals for villagers in their village. As for the various materials and props needed for the ceremonies, they were provided free of charge by the council. The master of ceremonies presiding over the ritual and the chanting for salvation were also provided free of charge by the two religions, which was well received by the masses.

Turning to the records of the village committee's latest democratic life meeting on June 15th this year, the content showed that the township randomly organized villager representatives to conduct a secret ballot evaluation of the three village cadres, including the village head and deputy village head. All three received 15 "votes affirming work achievements," showing that the village committee is trusted.

I turned a few more pages forward and saw a page about a democratic life meeting in the village. Participants included not only village cadres but also the heads of the pai and jia groups in the village. I noticed the record of a speech by a group head named Guo Jin: "I was frequently transferred and borrowed by the township this year, rarely participating in village work, let alone playing a leading role or helping the masses. I hope everyone will offer me valuable opinions and give help." Next was a record of a speech by a women's committee member named Huo Shouying: "As a female cadre and also a contact object of Director Du of the Social Investigation Department, I also rarely participated in village work. I only thought it was enough to do well the central tasks directly assigned by superiors, especially Director Du, and rarely asked about matters in my own village. I must work hard in the future." Needless to say, the straightforward words of the two grassroots cadres objectively reflected the current situation where rural cadres in some places are used in multiple places.

Seeing there was a women's committee member in the village, I was a bit strange: I had visited many villages, and except for some villages in the old liberated area of Lingao which had women's committee members, most villages did not. Tankou is neither a model village nor an old area village; how could it have such a position?

I asked Old Huo and learned that this village was a village where Du Wen, Director of the Social Investigation Department, directly stayed slightly. Therefore, the situation of foot-binding, beating and scolding women, and female illiteracy in this village was better than in surrounding villages. Especially foot-binding, after several "concentrate forces to fight a war of annihilation" campaigns by the Social Investigation Department, had completely disappeared.

It seems that our women's work also includes many tasks urgently needed to eliminate bad customs. Doing "three harmonies and one less" [tolerance/compromise] won't work; for certain key backward areas, we must cook more "half-cooked rice" [force the issue] and fully utilize the weapons of law and dictatorship.

I proposed to meet this women's committee member, and Old Huo quickly called her over. It turned out Huo Shouying was a distant niece of Old Huo's clan. Looking at her age, she was just over twenty but was already a widow—the evil Kong Youde mutiny killed her family members, and now she had no relatives by her side.

However, from her face, you couldn't see any dejected emotions. It could be seen that she was full of enthusiasm for life and work here. I noticed she had cut her hair short—one must know that although rural women here mostly no longer combed overly complex buns, very few cut their hair short.

"This way, the time for washing and combing hair can be much less," Huo Shouying said. "The extra time is just right for studying and working."

In the conversation, I learned she was a women's cadre personally selected and focused on by Du Wen, a student of the Ma'niao Peasant Movement Institute, and recently went to participate in a three-month "Special Training Class for Women Cadres." After talking with her, I found that she not only spoke the new language well but also had a strong grasp of the Senate's policies. She spoke about village work logically and clearly, with an added touch of female meticulousness.

Speaking of women's work in the village, Huo Shouying said that after Chief Du brought people to "rectify" several times, the trend of beating wives had restrained somewhat. But most villagers didn't understand and didn't approve of this work. Most people thought it was a dog catching mice—meddling in others' business, and many women held the same view.

"...Some women are frequently beaten and scolded by their husbands themselves, yet make cynical remarks about our work." Huo Shouying revealed a helpless expression when recounting, "Some people even make jokes about me, saying I'm jumping happily now, but wait until I have a husband's family later, I'll likewise be pressed onto the kang by a man and whipped on the bare bottom..."

Although she spoke in a joking tone, it could be seen that this women's cadre had great waves in her heart. It seems that changing customs and habits in rural areas is not a simple matter.

Subsequently, we talked about other things, mentioning many people's livelihood issues repeatedly raised in various villages I had visited: bride prices, engaging in broken shoes [adultery], bachelors tearing down toilets... She also mentioned women's childbirth issues, which male cadres rarely mentioned.

"Now everyone's life is stable, with food and clothes. Many women are giving birth; even women nearing menopause are getting pregnant. The town came to the village several times to promote 'giving birth at the hospital' and 'midwives must hold a midwifery license,' but there are only three licensed midwives in our town, who simply can't cope. Besides, going to the county isn't easy. Most women still hire 'waist-holding old women' [traditional lay midwives] at home for childbirth. Childbirth is dangerous for women; in recent years, several women in this village passed away due to childbirth, and some were even two lives lost in one corpse."

Speaking of this, this women's cadre's eyes turned red. I deeply feel that in the field of health care, we still have a lot of work to do.

In the conversation, I felt that this women's cadre's work attitude was very serious, with a spirit of drilling down into things and doing them to the end.

Subsequently, at my request, the accountant took out the village's land and household registration files. Not only were there detailed land registrations, but also sketch maps. The cultivated land blocks in the whole village were very neat, typical works of our surveyors. The accountant said: "These cultivated lands were measured by 'Chief's apprentices.' The area of each mu is exactly the same. There is no longer a distinction between large mu and small mu."

Because the area of a mu is exactly the same, when distributing land, the problem of good and bad land had to be considered. The general principle at the time was "determine quantity by yield," roughly meaning those who got good land got less, and those who got bad land got more. It was considered that this could roughly level the total income of every household.

But the accountant said this turned out to be a big problem in practice. Farmers allocated bad land had to invest more labor to produce, which instead aggravated their burden.

"Without large livestock, farming 20 mu of good land is strenuous, let alone some families allocated poor land have to farm thirty or forty mu!" The accountant said, "Many people, to save trouble, just plant sweet potatoes and miscellaneous grains that don't need much care. Because of the quality of this distributed land, quite a few people in the village have opinions. If following the customs of our hometown, good land, bad land, paddy field, dry land, the size of one mu is all different, which would be fairer instead."

Regarding this situation, I have heard village cadres and villagers reflect on it more than once. It seems there are still too many "decisions made by slapping the head" [arbitrary decisions] in our work, with insufficient estimation of the complexity of the actual situations faced.

Besides the problem of land distribution area, farmers' personal enthusiasm hasn't been fully mobilized. Many immigrants are unfamiliar with rice production, and the Heaven and Earth Society doesn't organize the production of wheat, millet, and sorghum they are familiar with, nor does it provide corresponding seeds and technical guidance. Many farm households adopt extensive cultivation methods, resulting in very low yields.

The accountant said immigrants had strange words at the beginning: farmed for a lifetime, now need a few Southern Barbarians to be teachers teaching themselves how to farm. Now there are fewer strange words, but villagers still really want to plant wheat.

These vivid situations remind me that immigrant education is not something that can be achieved overnight. Rural work must start from reality and provide classified guidance, not "one size fits all." Especially the point that the actual area of each mu is not the same makes me realize that the concept of numbers in rural areas has great elasticity and can even be established by usage among villagers. This point doesn't conform to standardization, but it indeed has certain rationality in rural areas. How to balance rationality while persisting in standardization seems to be a topic testing our governing ability.

Because the household registration files hadn't been checked by anyone for half a year, many pages were stuck together. I flipped through them and couldn't see the flow of rural population. Except for births and deaths, there had been no changes since the village was built. But upon specific inquiry, more than a dozen farmers had been recruited to go to Lingao and Qiongshan and no longer lived in this village. Because they didn't migrate their household registration, the registration files failed to reflect this timely and accurately.

Next, I visited several households in the village. The first one was the village accountant. His family has 5 people, 3 girls. The eldest and second daughters were brought over by his wife when she remarried; only the youngest daughter was born locally. Such recombined families are very common in various immigrant villages.

His family was distributed 30 mu of land, with both paddy fields and dry land. Sweet potato yield is over 500 jin per mu annually, and rice yield is about 300 jin per mu annually. Plus the subsidy for being an accountant, they are considered well-off in the village. Consequently, the family has more daily industrial products, and the proportion of fine grain in their food is also higher.

Coming out of the accountant's house, I randomly visited 3 farmer households along the way. One of them was a middle-aged couple with two sons. The eldest son is 20; after injuring his shoulder working in Jiazi Coal Mine years ago, he retired due to illness and returned home. Now farming at home, his income is greatly affected because he can't do heavy work, and without money, he can't get a wife. The younger son was initially at home, recruited to Sanya last year, but didn't accumulate any money either, entering the house empty-handed when returning to the village before the Spring Festival. The old couple's greatest hope now is for the two sons to find wives—but because of the bride price issue, hope is slim.

The condition of this family is a small microcosm of the rural areas. I have investigated some farm households before; most unmarried young people going out to work provide almost no financial assistance to their parents. It's considered good if they can start a family and establish a career themselves. It goes without saying that the "account" of doubting farmers' income needs to be recalculated. We must not be blindly optimistic and must take measures for multi-channel comprehensive income increase.
