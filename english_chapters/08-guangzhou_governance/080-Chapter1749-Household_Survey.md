# Chapter 1749: Household Survey

The beggars were not only responsible for watching streets and beating the watch, collecting road corpses, firefighting association firefighting and carrying water, opening and closing river channel gates, clearing ditches and dredging silt... their figures were present in almost all these daily municipal work. If the upper stratum and Big Bones of the Guan Di Temple people were not thoroughly overthrown, these jobs would only become their tools to exploit citizens and beggars.

"If we covet ruling simply and saving money, the Guan Di Temple people are very useful tools for the ruler," Lin Baiguang said. "They don't need a single penny of funding from the government, yet they undertake many jobs that should originally be undertaken by the government. It's simply perfect socialized management..."

"But actually there is a price," Mu Min said.

"Correct, this price is actually borne by the common people." Lin Baiguang said, "Actually the government also pays a price: the Guan Di Temple people's various seizing by force and trickery from citizens for hundreds of years, shielding criminals and harming citizens' interests, is actually the government ceding part of taxation rights and public security rights to obtain their services. The result inevitably damages the government's credibility and authority, which is not cost-effective from the perspective of ruling."

Mu Min nodded and did not express in-depth opinions on this issue. She asked: "Director Lin, what is your opinion?"

"Let's not rush for now. First investigate their background clear. Finally, catch them all in one net." Lin Baiguang said.

The composition of beggar groups was complex with numerous personnel, and there were also a large number of disabled people, elderly people, and children without labor ability. Without investigating the details clearly and formulating a proper placement plan, rashly taking action to knock out the leaders and Big Bones at various levels would be easy, but the personnel scattering out would still be a social problem.

"Good!" Mu Min nodded. To investigate the background clearly, she had to start by improving grassroots organizations. Mu Min decided to personally grasp this household census and investigate the background of the Guan Di Temple people during the survey.

Mu Min immediately began to organize teams. These past few days, she had initially established the police organ and enriched the personnel. But these measures basically focused on "maintaining public security," and were still far from achieving the goal of "governance."

She knew that the Senate's philosophy on police affairs and grassroots governance was modeled after the first thirty years (of PRC), and much of it was inherited from the old Japanese police system. Therefore, police work had a strong tendency of "police administrative-ization." That is to say, the police organ was not only a law enforcement unit but also undertook the work of grassroots administrative governance.

To meet this demand, grassroots strength had to be enriched as soon as possible. Police officers couldn't be enriched in a short while, so the old Baojia system had to be utilized.

She summoned Meng Gongchang and asked him to immediately send people to spread the word to convene a meeting of Baozhangs (Bao Chiefs) of the whole city and various gate suburbs.

Guangzhou's old grassroots Baojia system was basically established according to the methods proposed by Wang Shouren and Hai Rui: a system of ten households per Jia, and several Jia per Bao. "Paijia Registers" were kept in the archive repositories of the prefecture and county yamens—residents, regardless of status or gender, as long as they were over fifteen years old and were permanent residents of the household, had to register in the Paijia Register. Its data accuracy was far higher than the Yellow Registers. It was already similar to the modern household registration system.

But the Paijia Registers were not perfect. First, they only registered men and women over fifteen years old. Second, the grasp of population changes was insufficient. Although there were regulations on floating population registration, the problem was that there were no police stations in the Ming Dynasty, and registration depended entirely on whether the Jia Chief was dedicated. So these registration materials could only serve as a reference.

There were several thousand Jia Chiefs in the whole city of Guangzhou. Mu Min naturally couldn't call them all for a meeting—even if only convening Bao Chiefs, there were several hundred people.

The Bao Chiefs came cautiously to the Lingao Circuit Yamen—according to reason, Bao Chiefs seeing officials usually went to the prefecture or county yamens. This time they were summoned to the Australian "Chief Constable Yamen," and the newly appointed "Head of Fast Class" by the Australians was actually a woman! Female bandit chiefs, female bandits, etc., were occasionally heard of, but a woman serving as a constable was really heard of for the first time. In short, everything the Australians did revealed rarity.

Probably due to the element of curiosity, the Bao Chiefs came very completely. Except for a few missing and those truly sick and unable to move, almost all Bao Chiefs in the city came. Because too many people came, not only was the main hall of the Lingao Circuit Yamen full of people sitting, but even the courtyard and under the eaves were full of Bao Chiefs coming for the meeting, a dense mass of people.

When Mu Min appeared wearing the black uniform of a senior police officer, a commotion immediately arose in the venue: the well-tailored black uniform jacket, black uniform skirt, and long boots, this heroic and capable "Australian attire," made the Bao Chiefs' eyes widen instantly: This female Short Hair is outstanding! The Bao Chiefs in the back rows stood up, standing on tiptoes to look.

The only female Short Hair they knew was Pei Lixiu, but Pei Lixiu mostly wore Great Ming women's clothing, and sometimes wore "improved Hanfu" style clothes—roughly within the cognitive range of people at that time. Mu Min's completely modern uniform gave them a huge impact instantly. Everyone was dumbfounded.

Mu Min was already used to this kind of behavior from the natives, but there were really a bit too many "onlookers" today, which was somewhat embarrassing more or less.

Several runners saw the scene losing control and hurriedly came out shouting "Mighty—" in unison, pressing back the Bao Chiefs who had been commotion for a while.

Meng Gongchang served as the Cantonese translator for the meeting. Mu Min didn't talk nonsense and immediately assigned three tasks.

First is the re-registration of all Bao and Jia Chiefs. The current Bao and Jia Chiefs must report and register at the Municipal Police Bureau within a time limit. Those who fail to come overdue will be removed from the list. At the same time, submit a copy of "Personal Autobiography," filled out according to the format template.

Second, Bao Chiefs convey to various Paijia that the Police Bureau is preparing to re-register the Paijia Registers. Order all Jia to fully cooperate.

Third, distribute format templates, and Bao Chiefs fill out "Report on Basic Situation of XX Bao" on the spot.

Based on the basic situation reports they filled out, naturalized citizen staff marked the jurisdiction of each Bao on the Guangzhou map to arrange the order of the census.

While arranging the census matters intensely, Mu Min mobilized census personnel. Since the number of naturalized citizen cadres was limited, most personnel in the census teams were old personnel. But Mu Min arranged at least three naturalized citizen cadres who could speak Cantonese in each group to play a role of mutual supervision. In addition to the group leader, the clerk responsible for filling out registration forms and household registers must also be a naturalized citizen person, to prevent the retained clerks from playing tricks secretly. For this reason, not only were personnel fluent in Cantonese among naturalized citizen cadres citywide drafted, but many Cantonese-speaking soldiers from the National Army and Regular Army were also seconded.

Zhang Yu hadn't gone to the community school for the last few days. Since the Australians entered the city, the community school closed its doors. It was said that the teacher hid in the countryside and hasn't returned yet. Without anyone to teach, the community school simply closed for holidays.

Community school closing might make others heartbroken, but the children in the school secretly rejoiced one by one—in ancient society, whether academies or private schools, there were only a few days of holidays during the New Year all year round. Usually, unless the teacher had something to do and asked for leave, generally there were never holidays. Students could now skip school openly and honestly, each one like a monkey released from a lock. Calling friends and companions to travel around looking at "Australian scenery," throwing the teachers' admonition of "don't run around" to the back of their heads.

Zhang Yu was not so lucky: he could originally skip class to go out and play under the name of "going to school." Now that there was an open and honest holiday, his family wanted him to help—after the Australians "recovered" Guangzhou, people from very far places in the city came to buy this "Australian favorite" walnut cookie. Don't know if they wanted to use this to establish a connection with the Australians, or wanted to understand the Australians' temperament and habits. Anyway, his family's walnut cookie business suddenly doubled several times. Making the originally busy business even more overwhelmed. Zhang Yu had no choice but to help at home.

He knew how to do the work—he learned it by watching since childhood. But being tied to the shop all day busy kneading dough and peeling walnuts was really not what a person like him who liked movement and was curious willing to do. Furthermore, he hadn't done much work since childhood. After being busy all day, when he climbed into bed to sleep, he only felt that all his limbs and bones were unbearably sore. He couldn't help but groan secretly.

Fortunately, when the family needed to deliver fine goods, they always asked him to go, which counted as a chance to go out and relax.

Taking the opportunity of delivering goods, Zhang Yu ran to quite a few places in the city. To say what difference there was since the Australians came, it seemed there was no difference from the Great Ming time—only heard that they demolished the sheds on Chengxuan Street and cleared the road. Also arrested and killed a batch of clerks. The city foxes and social rats immediately became much more honest. If changed to the Tofu shop's boss lady's words, it was: "Opening the door feels refreshing."

The clerks continued to exist. They all wore the brass basin hats passed from the Australians, with a sleeve band on their sleeves written with the character "Assist" (Xie), patrolling the streets. One by one behaved well-manneredly, without the vigor of shouting and bullying, trying to get petty advantages from shops at every turn back then.

The soldiers brought by the Australians could be seen everywhere. Some wore blue-grey uniforms, some wore grey uniforms. Zhang Yu had read various "Australian Magazines" for a long time and knew that those wearing grey short jackets were called "National Army"—Li Ziyu said the formal title of the Great Song was "Xiang Army" (Box Army), and the other kind was probably the so-called "Forbidden Army" (Imperial Guard).

These Xiang Army and Forbidden Army were stationed at city gates, big temples, and yamens. Heard that quite a few were also stationed at the parade ground outside the city. They were on duty and standing guard everywhere in the city, with neat uniforms and excellent weapons. Standing guard and patrolling with high spirits. Compared to the officers and soldiers who were either sluggish and poor or rude and violent, even looking with a commoner's eyes, one knew they were two completely different armies.

Zhang Yu never had good feelings towards officers and soldiers—they only knew how to bully common people. When water bandits and local bandits kidnapped people, robbed, and killed outside the city, they treated it as seeing nothing; nor did he feel that being a soldier was a glorious thing—that was a business done by poor ghosts with no way out. Initially reading Australian magazines saying Australians considered "being a soldier glorious," he couldn't quite understand. At most, he could only associate it with the military merit nobility rank of Qin and Han dynasties—this was said by Wu Ming. But at this moment, seeing the mighty military appearance of the Australians regardless of Xiang Army or Forbidden Army, he suddenly understood a lot.
