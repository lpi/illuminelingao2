# Chapter 1694 - Resident Police

Not only was there no commerce in the village, but culture, education, and health were also blank—though this was limited by objective conditions and couldn't be rushed. However, various commercial sideline businesses should absolutely be launched. Old Meng's tofu workshop could be done, and the Cooperative General Society could also set up a sales agency here to sell daily necessities like oil, salt, soap, and matches, while purchasing some sideline products to enliven the market, which would be beneficial to both the state and the people.

As for village administration management, he felt that the current management was too detailed and obviously exceeded the actual ability of grassroots cadres. Even if they barely managed to do it, the data had significant distortion. Excessive data was also beyond the Senate's current calculation and statistical capabilities; it should be reduced, focusing on grasping a few key data points.

He felt the practice of giving so-called office land was very bad. Firstly, the output of land was unstable. Secondly, village cadres abusing villagers' labor could easily cause dissatisfaction. Corresponding office expenses and subsidies should be given directly. The problem of cadres eating and drinking when going to the countryside hadn't been completely solved even in the 21st century; basically, it would be good for a while after a crackdown, then rebound immediately as soon as it relaxed. Temporarily, he could only think of controlling the number of inspection groups and tour groups...

Yun Suji thought and wrote like this, feeling the passage of time not at all. After a long time, he felt a bit cold on his body. He got up and draped clothes over himself, looking at the window again to see the dawn already revealing itself. He knew this night had passed, yet he wasn't sleepy at all. Feeling the indoor air was a bit foul, he simply pushed open the door and went into the courtyard.

Just opening the door, a gust of slightly cold but refreshing air hit his face, and his spirit couldn't help but be lifted. Seeing a two-story lookout tower in a corner of the courtyard—this was also standard equipment for a standard village, with a bell hanging on it to summon villagers in emergencies—his interest was high, so he simply climbed the steps to the lookout tower.

On the tower, one of his guards was standing sentry. Seeing him come up, the guard hurriedly saluted: "Chief..."

"At ease, I just came up to look around casually." Yun Suji waved his hand. He did a few chest expansion exercises and a few deep breaths. Pulling the jacket that was about to fall off, he looked out from the tower. The houses and courtyards of the standard village were spread out neatly under his feet. Outside the village were large patches of fields with crisscrossing paths, dotted with miscellaneous woods. In the distance was the Nandu River flowing like a satin ribbon through this thousand li of fertile fields, with morning mist drifting on the river surface.

Suddenly, sunlight sprayed out from the thin mist, with ten thousand rays of morning glow. A half-wheel of red sun rose slowly from the river surface, instantly dyeing the sky red, looking magnificent with rosy clouds. Yun Suji couldn't suppress the excitement in his heart and hummed softly: " The sun comes out shining in all directions, the revolutionary people have a roadmap..."

After eating breakfast made by Liu Yuanhu's woman at the village office, the Resident Police of Boli Village arrived. This police officer was assigned here the year before last, also a refugee from Shandong. Hearing the Chief was here, he hurriedly came to report.

Yun Suji saw this policeman was fully fifty years old, with a face full of stubble, his black uniform wrinkled. Probably because he came in a hurry, he didn't even wear his armed belt. He thought wonderingly how Ran Yao selected police! What's the use of getting some old, weak, sick, and disabled to be resident police.

Yun Suji spoke a few sentences with him and saw that he spoke clearly and handled things in an organized way, so his impression of him improved. Mentioning the matter of Old Lady Cao committing suicide at the village office, the policeman smiled bitterly: "This old lady, I really admire her!"

"How so?"

"She is considered famous in our area. I brought her back from the county twice, and probably three or four times from the township. She sues everywhere. If Liu Yuanhu didn't intercept her here, she would probably have run to Lingao to sue before the Emperor long ago." The policeman said, "Actually, it's just a breath of anger held for too long that couldn't turn the corner, I'm afraid her mind has become confused."

"She said Old Meng's son, who makes tofu in this village, was beaten to death by Liu Yuanhu. Is there such a thing?"

"How is that possible?" The policeman shook his head, "Does Liu Yuanhu have such guts? Wouldn't us police all become free-loaders then. Besides, I know clearly about Old Meng's son's matter: the brick factory just processed his formal employment procedures last week. He came to me to transfer his household registration—can the brick factory transfer household registration and process employment for a dead person?"

Yun Suji hadn't believed it originally, and hearing the policeman say this, he completely set his mind at ease.

"This time she courted death herself; she must be handled properly for the crime of disturbing government and public institutions!" The Resident Police seemed to have accumulated grievances against Old Lady Cao too, rubbing his fists and wiping his palms.

"She went to the township and county so many times, and wasn't punished?"

"If wanted to deal with her seriously, she would have been arrested long ago. At the start, everyone pitied the old and poor. She is a widow in her fifties, lost her son, and her daughter-in-law ran away. She is indeed pitiful enough!" The Resident Police sighed, "The first time I brought her back from the township, the officer at the station told me: Old Lady Cao is very pitiful, telling me to treat her politely on the way. Later when picking up the person at the county, Chief Liu even specially used the county's official carriage to send us back."

"So it was like that."

"Later it wouldn't do. After she went a few times, everyone got annoyed. Besides, those things she talked about were either non-existent or not illegal. Yet she insisted the leaders handle them. Who could welcome that? But this old woman is also cunning: she doesn't barge into the yamen to beat the drum and cry injustice, but 'sues on the ground' outside the gate. The police at most handle her for 'setting up a stall in violation of regulations.' Even if arrested, she can't be sentenced. Sentencing her to caning, she is in her fifties, afraid she can't withstand it—in the end, they still call me to pick her back up."

This became a headache for the Resident Police. A round trip took at least half a day, and other things couldn't be done.

He chatted with the policeman about the local public security situation. The resident police said there were basically no criminal cases locally; because the Senate was severe in punishing various minor crimes—not only would they be put to labor reform if caught, but three-time repeat offenders would be exiled to hard labor camps for life—so some loafers accustomed to petty theft common in rural areas were quickly purged. There were many cases of stealing telegraph wires and poles in the first few years, but after a special crackdown, there were very few later.

"Are there many people gambling here?"

"Many!" The Resident Police nodded, "Especially now it's the slack farming season, men have nothing to do and gather to gamble. Quarreling and fighting are also very common."

This was the result of a severe lack of cultural entertainment and pastime. Yun Suji thought, the village had no cultural facilities, the vast majority of people were illiterate, and besides f*cking wives and beating wives when going home at night, there was really no entertainment to speak of—the problem was there weren't many people with wives.

"Besides gambling, there are also many engaging in broken shoes [adultery]." The Resident Police said, "We have more men than women here, and many bachelors are suffocated like red-eyed chickens. As long as a woman loosens her trouser belt a bit, she can always get some benefits. Widows are one thing, but quite a few have husbands! For this matter, families fight and make a scene until it's irreconcilable, and it almost caused cases involving human lives! Some widows, because engaging in broken shoes has many benefits, simply refuse to remarry. There is a Widow Yang in my village, many people came to matchmake but she refused to marry, wanting no betrothal gifts no matter how large. Besides the land distributed by the Senate, she opened up seventy or eighty mu of wasteland. Five or six wild men engaging in broken shoes with her help her farm, earning a huge family fortune..." He shook his head as he spoke.

Yun Suji didn't know whether to laugh or cry. He read the two journals and one newspaper every day, and when speaking of rural situations it was all "excellent." He hadn't expected there were such bizarre things!

The resident police was still chattering: "In the past, the clan controlled the village, or at worst, the elders of the same branch were there, so there was still some face, and it certainly wouldn't be so disorderly. Now the village is full of unrelated outsiders, and many people have become arrogant without the control of parents and in-laws, saying things like: 'I'm the master of my own body, I use it however I want'. Listen to this, Chief, is there still the four words of propriety, justice, integrity, and honor! Someone asked me to come out and manage it, but the handbook given by the Senate doesn't have a clause for catching broken shoes, and I don't know what to do..."

"Engaging in broken shoes is better than 'red-eyed chickens' coming out to r*pe big girls and young wives, don't you say?" Yun Suji said. This was far from a problem that could be solved by a few laws. Without solving the problem from the root, simply "cracking down" wouldn't reduce such phenomena, nothing more than turning from above ground to underground. Furthermore, "engaging in broken shoes" could be considered a way for the bottom layer to relieve social pressure on their own.

Yun Suji chatted with the resident police for quite some time and grasped some more grassroots situations. Because the resident police was under vertical leadership, his relationship with the village was detached, and he spoke more without concealment when discussing problems. His work destined him to contact many dark sides, so many situations that couldn't be obtained when chatting with villagers and cadres could be learned from the resident police.

The resident police also mentioned that the village's household registration was not solid now. Many young and strong people went out to work in enterprises—the people left, but neither the enterprises nor the individuals came to transfer the household registration locally, so there were many cases of empty hanging household registrations.

"Now if asked to produce resident population statistics, I'm in a difficult position. The number in the household registration book and the people in the village simply don't match up!" The Resident Police complained, "If an inspection comes down and says I reported falsely, I can't afford the blame!"

"Why don't they come to transfer, find it troublesome?"

"Factories probably find it troublesome; as for individuals, they still don't want to lose the land under their names!"

Yun Suji recalled that every full laborer was distributed thirty standard mu of arable land when settling down! Half laborers also had fifteen standard mu. This kind of arable land only had "surface rights" and no "bone rights," meaning farmers only had usage rights but couldn't buy or sell. Once the farmer no longer cultivated it, it would be taken back and redistributed.

"According to the rules, once his household registration leaves, the land must be taken back. Now his household registration doesn't leave, and he rents the land to people in the village to farm. Public grain and corvée labor all count as someone else's. Although the rent obtained isn't much, it's a sum of extra income after all!"

"No wonder, there really are many twists and turns in here!"

The more he listened, the more he felt that rural work had a heavy burden and a long way to go. Unconsciously, he had the idea of writing what he saw and heard into a newsletter for publication in the two journals and one newspaper, to let more people realize the importance of rural work.
