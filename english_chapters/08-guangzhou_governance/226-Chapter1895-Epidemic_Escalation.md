# Chapter 1895 - Epidemic Escalation

## Epidemic Escalation

After Wen Desi left, Lin Motian wrote a note to Cui Hantang, explaining that he urgently needed to find a "feng shui treasure site" in the suburbs to serve as a charitable cemetery for disease victims. He asked Cui Hantang to help with the site inspection.

Then he wrote another note to Shen Ruiming, requesting prosecution of those recently detained for mobbing the epidemic prevention station and violently resisting quarantine inspectors from entering private residences for inspection.

"...Prosecute under the charge of obstructing official duties or endangering public safety, to create a powerful deterrent."

After writing the notes and handing them to the messenger, he exhaled deeply. Since matters of principle absolutely could not be compromised, perhaps in the specific implementation he could add some content that might soothe people's hearts—for instance, holding a public memorial service?

But with people in a panic outside, holding such a mass gathering didn't seem appropriate.

"This really is difficult."

Fu Wuben, woken by the loudspeaker broadcast, yawned widely. After struggling to open his eyes and suddenly realizing where he was, he immediately and efficiently dressed and began washing up. A new day had begun, and there was still much work to be done.

Doctors and nurses from Bairèn General Hospital, Ma'ao Army General Hospital, and Hong Kong Naval General Hospital had been arriving in Guangzhou one after another, reinforcing the frontline epidemic prevention work. Even so, the gaps in Guangzhou's health department remained huge.

After the plague outbreak, the personnel shortage had increased sharply with epidemic prevention pressure. The various epidemic prevention stations and newly established infectious disease treatment stations still didn't have enough resident doctors. Due to the special nature of infectious disease management, the personnel stationed at various locations were mostly from the Epidemic Prevention Battalion. Having a few medics assigned was already considered good conditions—in Lin Motian's view, these medics from crash courses were really no different from epidemic prevention team members. Anything slightly serious required requesting support from the Guangzhou General Hospital. Implementation of isolation and cremation policies faced constant obstacles, and more hands were needed everywhere.

Fu Wuben struggled to keep his heavy eyelids open while his hands moved quickly. With a towel draped around his neck the way he'd learned from Old Xie, he rapidly brushed his teeth while his mind was already turning to the day's work.

His job was to serve as a roving doctor at the epidemic prevention station. With the health department's capabilities, they simply couldn't station doctors at each epidemic prevention station. They could only adopt a district system—one doctor would be permanently stationed at a central station, making rounds at five or six surrounding epidemic prevention stations.

Fu Wuben had obtained his physician certification through the "lineage disciple" route. But according to health department regulations, traditional Chinese medicine "lineage disciples" had to receive modern medical training. Thus he had visited Bairèn General Hospital for advanced studies multiple times and had learned modern medicine. His knowledge of infectious diseases was roughly at a level just above popular science. But facing a group of naturalized citizens who needed to learn what "bacteria" were from scratch, his expertise was more than enough to impress most people—not to mention he had also earned a Class A diploma, already making him a bona fide intellectual among the naturalized citizens under the Elders' Council's rule. Besides, everyone knew that though this Dr. Fu was young, he was an Elder's personal disciple and very possibly would become a senior health department cadre in the future. So no one dared treat him lightly.

Though he was a station doctor, the health department actually had no effective treatment for plague. So his work mainly involved diagnosing suspected cases, checking whether various epidemic prevention measures had been implemented, filling out various forms daily according to Lin Motian's requirements, and "educating" the naturalized citizen workers participating in epidemic prevention.

The most important work was "training." As the epidemic developed, epidemic prevention work grew heavier, and the number of personnel deployed had increased dramatically. These naturalized citizen workers not only knew nothing about epidemic prevention—they had very little basic health knowledge and had varying degrees of fear about epidemic prevention work. Simply force-feeding them orders and demanding execution was very likely to cause problems. Matters like changing customs—mistakes there could be tolerated. But health work was a matter of life and death. Having them understand a bit of knowledge was better than being completely ignorant.

"Comrades, in our previous studies we already learned the principles of microbial pathogenesis. Today we'll be teaching about one of the most serious infectious diseases in the health epidemic prevention system—plague, which we call 'Disease No. 1.' This is a typical disease caused by bacteria. Let's learn about the pathogen, pathogenesis, and key points for prevention and treatment of plague." Fu Wuben professionally wrote two large characters—"鼠疫" (Plague)—on the blackboard and began his lecture.

"I know that in the quarantine and epidemic prevention training classes previously held by the Elders' Council, some comrades have already gained a preliminary understanding of the key points for preventing and treating common infectious diseases like plague, cholera, bacterial dysentery, smallpox, and so on. But I know you comrades must still have many questions, especially since most of you hadn't studied health or microbiology before attending the training classes. Therefore, Director Zhao has instructed me to give you another lecture on the basic information about these diseases. But actually, the training classes run by the Elders' Council already covered this in great detail. I really don't have much new to add—this is just a review."

"The pathogenic bacterium of plague is called Yersinia pestis—no, no, not 'one-two-three army,'" Fu Wuben glanced at the notebook of a medic in the front row and turned to write "耶尔森菌" (Yersinia) on the blackboard.

"Why such a strange name..." the medic mumbled somewhat embarrassedly, scratching a few lines in his notebook.

Fu Wuben recognized this medic. This was Yu Qing, whom his master Liu San had rescued from the river when entering Guangzhou and then saved his life with surgery. He was also originally a doctor by trade. After being saved by his master, he had persistently wanted to become his disciple. Seeing his determination, Liu San had agreed, making him Fu Wuben's "junior brother." However, because his origins were unclear, he had only been assigned to work at Runshitang's Guangzhou branch as a receiving physician.

"Yersinia is the name of a medical pioneer of our Great Song... judging by the name, probably a Semu person," Fu Wuben tugged at his dress code collar—he was very uncomfortable with the Lingao-style cadre uniform collar. "That's all beside the point... Comrades don't necessarily have to remember the bacteria's name. Preventing and treating disease is what we most need to focus on. Let me introduce the plague Yersinia bacterium..."

"What's with you, comrade... which department are you from? What's the big idea blocking me at a time like this? Do you know what I'm here to report? This matter is stipulated in the Quarantine and Epidemic Prevention Implementation Measures! I can even request to see your epidemic prevention team leaders directly!" Just as Fu Wuben was lecturing enthusiastically, a clamor came from the main entrance. He set down his book and peeked outside. The medic Yu Qing in the front row had already stood up with an expression of displeasure.

"What's all the yelling? If there's something to say, say it calmly. What kind of behavior is shouting so loud?" Yu Qing called toward the gate. Though he had only recently joined the cause and was still a new naturalized citizen, he had already personally experienced the brilliance of "Australian medicine." Though Liu San had taken him as a disciple, he only provided guidance in traditional Chinese medicine and said very little about Australian medicine. So Yu Qing treasured every lecture and training session organized by the health department. Thus when Fu Wuben's class was interrupted, he—sitting in the audience—was even angrier than the one standing at the podium. Especially when he looked and saw it was just a quarantine inspector at the door, he became even more displeased.

Fu Wuben gestured for everyone not to stir. He went over and asked: "I'm the central station doctor. What's the matter?"

"Comrade!" The quarantine inspector, seeing a doctor had arrived, immediately ignored the sentry and saluted: "I'm from Station 16. I have an urgent situation to report!"

A crowd had already gathered around. Fu Wuben said: "We have procedures for how we do things. If it's not extremely urgent, you making such a commotion is also a violation of procedural principles..."

"This IS extremely urgent!" The quarantine inspector's face reddened as he thrust a document forward, loudly declaring: "One suspected case of pneumonic plague discovered!"

"What... what...?" Yu Qing hadn't heard clearly.

"Have him say that again!" But Fu Wuben had heard. He was shocked, nearly dropping his teaching materials. Several cadres who had attended the training class turned pale upon hearing "pneumonic plague" and jumped up from their seats, running to the door.

"Quarantine Inspector Huo Junming reporting! One suspected case of pneumonic plague discovered in South Scissors Lane!"

Fu Wuben snatched the document from the inspector's hands: "Plague contact history... acute onset... high fever... cervical lymph nodes... bloody sputum... gram-negative bacillus..." Fu Wuben felt his hair standing on end. He shouted: "Messenger! Report to Epidemic Prevention Battalion Headquarters immediately!"

"What's his plague contact history about? Why wasn't he isolated?" Fu Wuben demanded, staring at Huo Junming. According to Lin Motian's latest requirements, the quarantine inspector responsible for each district had to conduct not only street patrols but also regular household inspections. Once a suspected case or contact was discovered, mandatory isolation had to be enforced immediately.

"The patient had contact with a peddler while purchasing goods—but he didn't recognize that peddler. They just stood in line together... That peddler was confirmed shortly afterward, but this patient today... because he didn't recognize the peddler and they'd only exchanged a few words, he forgot all about it afterward..." Huo Junming wore an extremely frustrated expression. "When I went to inspect, he didn't mention it, his family all didn't know—who could have imagined he would get infected like this!"

"What about that peddler? What's his current condition?" Yu Qing asked. Fu Wuben beside him wanted to ask why peddlers, a profession clearly designated for special monitoring, could still allow this kind of situation to happen. But after thinking about it, he felt asking such a thing was pointless. His lips moved a couple times but he said nothing more.

"Still in isolation at the Infectious Disease Hospital," Huo Junming said. "But I've never been to the Infectious Disease Hospital, so I don't know this patient's current condition..."
