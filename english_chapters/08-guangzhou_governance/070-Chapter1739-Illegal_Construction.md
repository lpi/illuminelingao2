# Chapter 1739: Illegal Construction

"This is majestic enough..." Liu Xiang laughed, deeply realizing the depth of the barrier between officials and the people. This was not something that could be changed overnight. So he didn't rush to make various "close to the people" gestures: supporting an old lady and asking with emotion: "How old are you?" or grabbing a vegetable-selling farmer and asking with expectation: "How is your income this year?". Instead, he walked along the street very casually. He saw the notice posted by the Comprehensive Governance Office on the street wall, and quite a few people were gathered under the notice, obviously reading it. He felt very satisfied. Our voice must be spread openly and uprightly, and the farther it spreads, the better.

Guided by Lin Baiguang, Liu Xiang walked all the way forward along the main street. Commerce here was flourishing, with various shops almost everywhere along the street. There were all kinds of shops. Walking along, he soon realized why Lin Baiguang asked him to "come and see in person"—the illegal construction and disorderly building in this 17th century were no worse than in the 21st century.

Except for the government offices on both sides of the street, almost not an inch of the street was not occupied by shops or sheds built by vendors on both sides. The road, said to be more than 9 meters wide, was occupied by at least half. In the most exaggerated places, the middle could barely allow a sedan chair to pass. Tattered reed mats, messy bamboo poles, bits and pieces of bricks and tiles... these sheds built from junk made the entire Chengxuan Street look like a tattered junk market—to be honest, junk markets in another time-space were neater than here.

He noticed that many sheds were built by shops on both sides of the street. Initially, they were probably for shading from the sun, but gradually they became part of the shops. Some simply set up workshops in these sheds, and some restaurants and tea stands simply put tables and chairs in the sheds for customers. There were also shops that had completed the transformation from sheds to houses, building houses properly on the road, treating the encroachment on the road surface as a fait accompli.

It could be seen that the road surface hadn't been repaired for a long time, or the repairs were very sloppy. He saw at least two types of paving on the street. One was made of green bricks standing on their sides and spliced into a herringbone pattern. Although incomplete, it could be seen that the paving was very fine and exquisite; the street surface generally presented a trend of high middle and low sides, which was conducive to street drainage. The other type was green stone slabs, and the paving was quite rough.

At present, regardless of the type of pavement, the damage was very serious, with missing bricks and cracked stone slabs. Whether it was due to the lack of drainage ditches or silting up, the drainage on both sides of the road was obviously poor. Sewage poured by shops flowed everywhere on the street. The sheds on both sides also showed their own abilities; some were raised with bamboo poles underneath, and others simply paved with sand and soil to raise the height. With the sewage and garbage piled up everywhere, an indescalable smell permeated the entire street.

Liu Xiang frowned and said: "How many years has this road surface not been repaired?"

Jia Jue hurriedly said: "It is repaired once every two or three years."

Every repair was when high officials like the Left and Right Administration Commissioners of Guangzhou took office. The one prefecture and two counties of Guangzhou would repair the road surface as a routine. First, to give the newly arrived lord a good impression; second, if the sedan bearers stepped into a pit and twisted their feet or tripped, the local officials couldn't explain it. The so-called repair was also very simple, just using a mixture of sand, soil, and crushed stones to level and tamp the uneven places on the road surface—actually similar to the practice of "yellow earth paving the road." Naturally, such repairs could fool people for a while, but over time it would return to the old appearance.

"Why not repair with bricks or green stone slabs like when building a road?"

Jia Jue smiled apologetically: "Replying to Your Excellency: mainly because there is no money. The last major repair of this Chengxuan Street was in the forty-second year of Jiajing. The green stone slabs were used then." While smiling apologetically, he said, "You don't know, this matter of repairing bridges and mending roads depends on the gentry and merchants. Nowadays, the years are not peaceful, who has this idle money? Repairing bridges and mending roads costs not small money; it can't be done without tens of thousands of taels of silver..."

Liu Xiang remembered Yu Eshui's lecture on "Ming Dynasty Fiscal Policy" and knew this was also the truth. The local finance of the Ming Dynasty was very weak. Public facilities basically relied on private fundraising and self-management. The government at best played the role of initiator and supervisor. Otherwise, so many stories of "repairing bridges, mending roads, and doing good deeds" wouldn't have been handed down in ancient times.

This was really "local autonomy" enough. Liu Xiang thought. He asked again, "Does this Chengxuan Street have drainage ditches?"

"Yes!" Jia Jue answered without hesitation.

"Where?"

"Your Excellency, please look." Jia Jue led their group to a place on the roadside not occupied by sheds. Liu Xiang saw a section of open ditch exposed outside, fully more than a meter wide. Although filthy, it could be seen that the ditch walls were built of bricks. It was filled with silt and various garbage, almost overflowing. Sewage flowed slowly in the ditch, emitting a disgusting stench.

"Originally, there was an open ditch on each side here. Rainwater and sewage from each household poured into it and then discharged into the Six Veins Canal. Now you can see it too."

These illegal structures and sheds occupying the road surface basically covered the open ditches with wooden boards or stone slabs and then built on top. The original "open ditches" became "hidden ditches" (sewers).

It might be said that sewers are much more hygienic than open ditches. The problem was that the "illegal buildings" on both sides of the road had completely covered the ditches. Even if the government wanted to dredge the ditches and clear the silt, it couldn't be done.

"With the ditches not dredged for many years, they have long been silted up. It's better these days when there isn't much rain. When the 'Return South Days' (humid season) come in a few days and there is a lot of rain, the ditches will overflow. That is when it's truly 'stinking to high heaven'." Jia Jue said.

"Why not dredge the ditches? Is it also because of no money?"

"Replying to Your Excellency: Dredging doesn't cost much money. Just calling the peasants from the four countrysides to dredge is enough. Even wages are not required much—just allowing them to haul the dredged stinking mud back for fertilizer is fine. But you also see," Jia Jue pointed at these sheds, "how to dredge ditches like this?"

"Shops cover the ditches to build sheds. The place is certainly bigger, but with this stinking water flowing everywhere, they are also suffering themselves." Liu Xiang was very puzzled.

"Your Excellency, it's true they bring the suffering on themselves. But since the situation has become like this, who is willing to tear down their own sheds to let the government dredge the ditches? Besides, tearing down one or two is useless. The sheds on both sides of this main street must all be torn down. There are several hundred merchants here, with different minds. So the matter has been discussed many times, but has never been done."

Liu Xiang said: "These sheds originally had no land deeds or house deeds. Merchants encroach on road government land; why doesn't the government tear them down?"

Lin Baiguang smiled: "That question is superfluous. Tearing down illegal structures has always been very difficult—the interests involved are too big."

Jia Jue smiled apologetically: "Master Lin is right. Which of these shopkeepers isn't backed by a big threshold? Some don't even put the magistrates of Nanhai and Panyu counties in their eyes, nor even the Prefect. As the saying goes, cutting off people's wealth is like killing their parents. When anxious, they will do anything. In the early years, a Prefect Hu wanted to tear down the sheds. The shopkeepers' bribery and connections didn't work, so they spent money to bribe the Guan Di Temple people, getting several thousand beggars to swarm the Prefectural Yamen entrance to shit and piss, sing Lotus Flower Drop (beggar songs), pretend to be crazy and curse on the street. After tossing about for a few days, they forced Master Hu to withdraw his order."

"Beggars are so powerful? The yamen has all the torture instruments and prisons. Arrest all those who come to make trouble, execute a few in standing cages, can't that cure them?"

"Beggars are people who have nothing. Even their rotten lives are precarious; this can't scare them." Jia Jue smiled, "Besides, how big is the prison? How many people can it hold? The yamen doesn't provide food, so they still have to be released. If the matter gets big and the opponent grabs a handle, the four-word comment 'inciting civil unrest' will immediately ruin the master's future."

"Truly amazing."

Lin Baiguang laughed: "Even if it's the most prominent gentry and big households in Guangzhou City, holding weddings or funerals, if they don't pay 'Bi Chen' to them in exchange for a scarlet post to paste on the door, I guarantee they will make a fuss so you can't handle the affair. Even if it gets big, a petition sent to the government, at most they get a few scapegoats to go to court. Beaten or killed as you please. Anyway, they have plenty of human lives to use."

"It seems this Mayor of Guangzhou is really not easy to be." Liu Xiang touched his forehead, "Qiongzhou Prefecture was just a small place after all. Can't compare." He turned to ask Lin Baiguang:

"How much do you grasp of the situation in this lower society?"

"Not much. The social sentiments here are dozens of times more complex than on Hainan Island." Lin Baiguang said, "Our City Operation Department has few people and limited strength, mostly taking the middle and upper-class route, knowing very little about the bottom of society—however, Qiewei Escort Agency should know some. Old Manager Sun also submitted a card to me, wanting to see you."

"I'll see him tonight." Liu Xiang said, "We need people like them now."

"Don't have too high hopes. Although the people the escort agency deals with include all kinds from the three religions and nine streams, they only 'deal with' them, not 'collude' with them. They may not know all the thresholds inside."

"You are presenting difficulties to me." Liu Xiang said with a smile, realizing...

"Not at all, not at all," Lin Baiguang said. "The three religions and nine streams inside and outside Guangzhou City are still quite afraid of us—this is thanks to the Special Reconnaissance Team back then. I don't think tearing down illegal structures is very difficult. We just entered the city, and tearing down the illegal structures on Chengxuan Street is also tantamount to expressing our determination to get rid of the old and establish the new to the citizens of Guangzhou."

"Right, not only that. We also need to do a few practical things to let them know we are different from the corrupt and declining Great Ming." Liu Xiang said, "My first impression after entering the city was that the streets were dirty and chaotic, with sewage flowing everywhere. We should mobilize the troops and agency personnel to carry out a comprehensive general cleaning, clear the garbage in the city, and also dredge the sewage system of Guangzhou. These are solid things beneficial to the common people."
