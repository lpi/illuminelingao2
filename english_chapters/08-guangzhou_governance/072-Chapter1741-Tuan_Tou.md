# Chapter 1741: Tuan Tou

The beggar gangs in large cities held significant power in classical Chinese cities and were also a crucial link in the government's so-called "socialized management." Therefore, the leaders of beggar gangs in the Ming and Qing dynasties were considered half-"official" figures, often possessing "tokens" symbolizing government authorization. These leaders held absolute power over the lives and deaths of the beggars. They enjoyed the offerings from the beggars, lived luxurious lives, not only having fine clothes and food, servants and maids, but often also possessing multiple wives and concubines, their lifestyle no different from that of wealthy merchants.

"Wenlan Academy owns quite a few shops on Chengxuan Street, all of which are prime locations earning a bucket of gold daily. If you want to tear down those sheds, Mo Rongxin will definitely go to the Guan Di Temple people for help," Bi Defan said. "The Chief must prepare early."

To understand more about the situation, after Bi Defan left, Lin Baiguang summoned a retained old clerk from the Fast Class named Gao Chongjiu.

The main work of the Fast Class was "arresting," and local public security work was all their responsibility, so they had the clearest grasp of the situation of various "city foxes and social rats."

Gao Chongjiu did not come from a Fast Class family. He had apprenticed under an old runner since childhood and endured half a life as a "white member" before managing to become a regular runner. He was extremely familiar with the social conditions and public sentiments of Guangzhou, especially his understanding of the lower class society was above that of ordinary runners.

Gao Chongjiu was already in his fifties, which was considered old age in the 17th century. He had difficulty with offspring, only having a son when he was over forty. because he believed in karma, he didn't dare to be excessively evil in his daily dealings, belonging to the category of people who could be won over.

Lin Baiguang asked him about the detailed inside story of the "Guan Di Temple people." Gao Chongjiu didn't hide anything and told everything he knew in detail.

He said the leader of the Guan Di Temple people was named Gao Tianshi, and his family had hereditarily held the position of General Tuan Tou of the Guan Di Temple people for generations.

"...According to Gao Tianshi, his ancestors followed Emperor Hongwu in conquering east and west, and came to Guangzhou from the campaign. When Emperor Hongwu ascended the throne and became the Emperor, since his ancestors were originally beggars, they received this reward. This matter happened long ago, and no one investigates whether it's true or false. However, Gao Tianshi always bragged that his family possessed the certificate granted by the Imperial Court for the General Tuan Tou of Guangzhou back then, as well as the 'Imperially Sealed Stick' bestowed from above."

Lin Baiguang nodded. This wasn't rare. The leaders of organized beggar gangs always attributed their sect's origin to a certain emperor. This wasn't completely fabricated; mostly, the government had indeed given them some power in history. As for whether it was the Emperor's golden words, that was just made up casually.

Although called the Guan Di Temple people, the general leader was actually not in the Guan Di Temple. Gao Chongjiu said Gao Tianshi's "Dou Kou" (den) was located in Jinhua Temple outside Xiguan. As for other lower-level leaders, they lived in various broken temples and ruined shrines inside and outside the city, each with their own territory and clear boundaries. Beggars from each den could not cross the boundary to beg. Foreign beggars also had to register at the Guan Di Temple to beg; otherwise, they would be beaten and driven away at best, or tied to a stone and sunk into the Pearl River at worst.

"How many beggars are registered at the Guan Di Temple in this Guangzhou City?" Lin Baiguang asked.

Gao Chongjiu was a bit nervous, licked his lips and said: "Approximately close to ten thousand people."

"Purple Kee has opened charity halls in Guangzhou for many years. Those willing to make a living could go to Lingao. Why are the beggars unwilling to go? Preferring to beg for a living in Guangzhou?"

Gao Chongjiu smiled: "Chief. Those registered at the Guan Di Temple are either old, weak, or disabled, afraid that going to the charity hall would require them to work and they couldn't do it, preferring to beg and drag out a feeble existence; or they are those with skills..."

Lin Baiguang asked: "What do you mean by skills?"

Gao Chongjiu said: "Begging also has many kinds. The most common: either begging along the street or sitting on the ground to beg. These are those without skills. Those with skills have skills passed down from masters. Or old beggars paired with child beggars, considered grandfather and grandson in distress; or female beggars holding a dead child, or getting a corpse from somewhere unknown, with a female beggar or child beggar kneeling beside to sell themselves to bury their relative... all are practiced routines—these count as one sect; there are also those sticking rotten meat on their bodies pretending to be disabled, or those who were originally disabled, this is another sect; then there are those smashing bricks on their foreheads, piercing nails through their faces..."

Lin Baiguang understood. The so-called "skilled" ones were actually professional beggars. Saying "begging," they were actually mostly "scamming." He asked again: "What else?"

"The last kind, the person is actually strong and healthy, and also has no skills. But they are lazy and averse to work. Apart from begging normally, they serve as attendants for ceremonial procession shops. After a wedding or funeral, not only do they get a full stomach, but they can also get some money to get by. Another trade is acting as thugs in rural armed fights."

Guangzhou's clan power was extremely strong, and armed fights were a common practice, even around the provincial capital. Some clan villages with weak power, in order not to fall behind in armed fights, often hired strong and healthy beggars through the Guan Di Temple dens as borrowed strength for the fights. Beggars mostly had no families, and there were no future troubles if they died in the fights, and the compensation was meager. So whenever there was an armed fight, it was time for their business to open.

"...Whenever there is a rural armed fight, the Big Bones are happiest. Not only can they get a cut of the 'hiring fee', if the person sent gets beaten to death, the employer must give compensation, and this money goes into their pockets. Furthermore, whenever there is an armed fight, if a life is taken, according to custom someone must be found to surrender and pay with their life. This is again a unique business of the Guan Di Temple. Either by coaxing or by force, they get a few old and weak ones from the group of beggars to pay with their lives, and can get another sum of life-buying money."

"What else?"

"As for other 'businesses', they are innumerable. Guarding righteous graveyards and cremation grounds; watching streets and striking the watch, acting as undertakers to collect ownerless corpses; wailing and crying when big households hold funerals... these are all considered legitimate businesses; speaking of illegitimate ones, the Ghost Market outside Xiguan selling various stolen goods and even burial objects dug from graves... without the backing of the Guan Di Temple people, the market couldn't be formed at all; foreign pickpockets, thieves, 'child abductors'... wanting to 'do business' inside and outside the city, also have to come to the Guan Di Temple to 'burn incense' and seek protection."

Lin Baiguang had been in Guangzhou for a long time and was not without contact with the Guan Di Temple people, but this was the first time he learned such detailed information. He felt that he had underestimated them in the past. Now it seemed that the Guan Di Temple people were already a festering sore of Guangzhou, which not only had to be treated but had to be treated quickly.

"So, the Guan Di Temple people are all willing to be beggars?"

"Can't say all. Except for those with 'skills', most people still want to have a proper meal. After all, in this line of work, you don't know if there's a next meal after this one, and you don't know when you'll drop dead on the street." Gao Chongjiu sighed, "No matter how majestic the Guan Di Temple people are, no matter how much money they make, how much can ordinary beggars get? They also have to pay tribute to the Big Bones every day. The beggars have a slogan: 'Take off shoes to earn for wearing clogs to eat, wear clogs to earn for wearing shoes to eat, wear shoes to earn for wearing boots to eat.' The little alms they beg for are given as tribute to the Big Bones, the Big Bones have to pay tribute to the Tuan Tou, and the Tuan Tou has to pay tribute to the yamen. Big fish eat small fish, small fish eat shrimp."

Lin Baiguang looked at Gao Chongjiu and suddenly asked: "Old Gao, I heard you and Gao Tianshi are sworn brothers?"

Gao Chongjiu was startled and hurriedly defended himself: "This lowly one indeed has close dealings with Gao Tianshi, but mostly for official business of the yamen. To win over this lowly one, because this lowly one is also surnamed Gao, he said he wanted to join clans with this lowly one and recognized as brothers of the same surname. He just said it with his mouth, and this lowly one just agreed carelessly—actually, this lowly one's ancestral home is Nanxiong, and his ancestral home is Huainan..."

"Alright, you don't need to defend yourself." Lin Baiguang interrupted him, "You and he are not the same kind of people. I am very clear about this."

"Yes, thank you Master for your clear judgment!" Sweat dripped from Gao Chongjiu's forehead. He heard from people in the Soap Class that the more than one hundred clerks and runners arrested these days were being tortured and interrogated day and night in the prefecture and county prisons, forcing them to confess their "crimes," especially to confess the whereabouts of hidden private wealth. The torturing experts in the Soap Class were all transferred to work in turns. It was heard that the "torture was extremely cruel" inside, and those arrested "only sought a quick death." Recently, because someone reported secretly or filed a complaint at the yamen, more than a dozen of the clerks and runners who had already been registered for retention were arrested again. He asked himself that he had no blood debts and didn't dare to do things against conscience on ordinary days, so he should be fine. If he was arrested because of this inexplicable relationship with a "brother," wouldn't it be unjust?

"You go down for now. Later I'll send someone to record a statement. You explain clearly to me everyone and everything you know about the Guan Di Temple people, whether big or small, important or unimportant people, one by one. The clearer and more understandable you speak, the greater your merit."

"Yes, yes, this lowly one understands." Gao Chongjiu's back was wet at this moment. The Chief's meaning was to move against Gao Tianshi!

Lin Baiguang thought for a long time alone behind the desk: Although Bi Defan warned that the Guan Di Temple people might make trouble, and the information provided by Gao Chongjiu just now also showed that this force was very powerful, he believed that they would not jump out proactively at present. Although they claimed to fear nothing in heaven or earth, they actually still feared strong power. At this moment of "change of dynasty," they wouldn't be so blind as to jump out proactively.

But their not coming out didn't mean the shop owners wouldn't use other means to resist. After all, the shop owners were "common people," "law-abiding citizens," and couldn't be handled simply by shouting kill and beat. Lin Baiguang had engaged in tearing down illegal structures when he was the director of the county office in the old time-space, and also dealt with mass incidents during demolition. The experience and lesson he learned was to have sufficient preparation before taking action. When implementing, the action must be fast, manpower and equipment must be sufficient. Once a sudden incident occurs, immediately control the situation with more people against fewer, to avoid spreading influence and prevent the crowd from being incited.

Although he had a team of naturalized citizen cadres who were few in number but quite capable, and a detective team with a huge number of people eager to show loyalty, enough to complete this operation, he decided that tomorrow's demolition operation should still use the National Army to hold the line, letting them appear with live ammunition to suppress the various evil winds in this city.
