## Chapter 1920 - Interview (Part One)

This was absolutely out of the question. First, though the Zeng family were small urbanites, they still observed the proprieties of parental arrangement and matchmaker's words. Having just passed the civil service examination at this moment of triumph, there was no way he could simply be dragged off to get married. Second, Zeng Juan had long harbored secret feelings for Zhang Yu's cousin Zhang Ting, and had also been exchanging glances with the young miss from the tofu shop across the street.

Yuan Shuzhi knew a bit about Zeng Juan's romantic affairs. He saw the servants pushing and shoving, about to carry Zeng Juan off. He quickly squeezed forward and declared loudly: "My young master already has a marriage engagement! We appreciate your kind intentions, but please go back!" Saying this, he grabbed Zeng Juan's arm and pulled him back.

Instantly Zeng Juan was caught in the middle like a rope in a tug-of-war. Right in the midst of this chaos, a police whistle sounded. Officers maintaining order nearby rushed over, shouting: "What's going on here?!"

The servants saw the situation and quickly released Zeng Juan's hands, slipping away. Only then did Zeng Juan escape this romantic tribulation. The two of them didn't dare show off anymore and hurried home.

The news that both Zeng Juan and Yuan Shuzhi had passed the written examination—and that Zeng Juan had placed first—immediately set the entire neighborhood abuzz. Whether new neighbors or old, and relatives and friends from all directions, came to the Zeng household to offer congratulations. Some even brought gifts. There were quite a few who came to propose marriage for Zeng Juan as well. The elder Zengs were elated beyond words, quickly ordering the teahouse to prepare refreshments and tea to entertain the stream of well-wishers. Only the relatives from the Zeng daughter's former husband Cao Xueguang's clan were glum: with Zeng Juan already having Li Ziyu as a backer, and now becoming an Australian official himself, the Wanshenglu Teahouse was now thoroughly and irrevocably surnamed "Zeng."

The coming and going kept them busy until the first watch before the crowd finally dispersed. Zeng Juan and Yuan Shuzhi, having spent the entire day viewing the results and receiving guests, were already so exhausted they were swaying on their feet. Yet after nightfall, instead of resting, the two discussed matters in the study.

It turned out that Yuan Shuzhi and Zeng Juan were somewhat at a loss regarding this Australian Palace Examination. In traditional civil service examinations, after the metropolitan examination came the palace examination. Though the palace examination was ostensibly presided over by the Emperor himself, in practice it was still about writing essays. After completion, the examiners would grade them and categorize them for submission. The Emperor didn't actually read the essays—at most he might glance at the quality of the calligraphy.

Yuan Shuzhi said: "Young Zeng, this Australian Palace Examination—that interview—is something unprecedented in the Pseudo-Ming or any previous dynasty. This Australian interview only requires speaking, not writing—how extraordinary! Though oral policy examinations were frequently used in the pre-Qin era, could the Great Song be imitating the pre-Qin tradition of rulers and guests debating to select talent? But this seems quite different from those dialogues!"

Zeng Juan said: "What are you worried about, Old Yuan? You've seen the examination guidelines. The written test counts for sixty percent, and the interview only forty percent. Your essay score is not low—as long as you don't freeze up and become speechless during the interview, you should have it in the bag! Let's quickly review the palace examination materials and discuss how to answer the questions."

With that, Zeng Juan produced an Australian civil service interview study guide rarely seen on the Guangzhou market. Zhang Yu had arranged to have it brought from Lingao. What a true good brother—money aside, this book was scarcely available even in Lingao. Even naturalized citizens from Lingao might not be able to obtain it! The textbook explained that this Australian civil service interview was officially called a "structured interview," which differed from any past form of oral examination. The book's explanation stated:

*Based on the competency requirements for specific positions, following fixed procedures, using specialized question banks, evaluation standards, and assessment methods, through face-to-face verbal communication between an examiner panel and the candidate, to evaluate whether the candidate meets the requirements for the recruitment position—a talent assessment method.*

This explanation might as well not have been explained at all for the two of them. So they gave up trying to understand what a "structured interview" meant and went straight to practicing questions. They took turns playing examiner, practicing different modules. This first question was Yuan Shuzhi asking Zeng Juan: "Young Zeng, please listen to the question. It goes like this: A deputy director of the Tax Bureau—hey, isn't that future Young Zeng?! Haha—attended a banquet. During the event, you encounter your childhood sweetheart whom you haven't seen for many years? What kind of question is this from the Senate! What respectable young lady would attend a banquet? Isn't this implying that this deputy director's childhood sweetheart is a prostitute?!"

Zeng Juan quickly said to Yuan Shuzhi: "Old Yuan, have you forgotten who you are after a few days of good meals?! Have you forgotten that our Great Song advocates equality between men and women?! How long has Governor Liu's 'Abolition of Foot-binding Decree' and 'Encouragement of Remarriage Decree' been in effect? Have you never seen Commander Lian Nichang, the female superior of Ziyu and Agui? As for Elder Pei Xiuli of the Purple Light Tower, Elder Zheng Shangjie of the Commerce and Industry department, and various other female Elders—have you forgotten them all?! Never forget State Councilor Ma's teaching that 'women can also hold up half the sky'! Old Yuan, your thinking must change, otherwise you'll definitely suffer in the interview!"

Yuan Shuzhi slapped his forehead and immediately replied: "Young Zeng is absolutely right—I was confused. I shall certainly correct this! Let's continue looking at the questions..."

Finally the interview day arrived. Zeng Juan put on the Australian-style clothes that Zhang Yu had brought him from Lingao. They were said to be personally designed by Elder Literary Chairman Wen—basically just a cadre uniform minus two pockets. Being young, Zeng Juan looked especially sharp in this "Australian suit." Only his topknot sitting on his head was rather cumbersome and didn't match the Australian clothing at all. He kept looking in the mirror, thinking it would be better to cut off the topknot. Yet somehow he couldn't bring himself to make that decision. In the end, he changed back to the traditional *lanshan* robe.

Yuan Shuzhi was still dressed in the standard scholar's attire—a plain blue straight-cut robe with a square scholar's cap on his head. Though somewhat shabby-looking, at least he appeared clean and neat.

The examination venue was again at the Tribute Courtyard. This time the security was even simpler—one only needed the retest notification to enter. Candidates first registered at the Mingyuan Tower, then were grouped and drew lots. Yuan Shuzhi and Zeng Juan were assigned to different groups. They were both lucky—one drew number five, the other number four. Near the front but not first, they could finish in the morning, and the examiners would still listen attentively.

The interview venue was set up in the "Public Hall Area" north of the "Heaven Opens Literary Fortune" archway. This was originally where officials and staff handled affairs during the civil service examinations, centered on the Hall of Ultimate Impartiality, Hall of Careful Vigilance, and Hall of Gathered Brilliance, with a large complex of buildings. Space was quite ample. At the staff's direction, candidates dispersed to several halls to sit and wait for their numbers to be called.

Zeng Juan went in first. The moment he walked through the interview room door, Zeng Juan felt his heart would leap out of his chest. He steeled his nerves and walked in carefully.

The interview room had originally been a garden pavilion behind the official hall for rest and relaxation. The furniture and decorations had not changed much; only a row of tables and chairs had been placed in the center, seating five examiners. Today's chief examiner was Tax Bureau Director Ai Zhixin, an Elder, with four senior naturalized citizen cadres at his sides.

Across from the tables and chairs was a separate desk and chair—the candidate's position—with stationery, paper, and an abacus prepared.

Zeng Juan walked to the interview desk, bowed, and said loudly: "Greetings, examiners!"

A naturalized citizen cadre said: "Greetings, candidate. Congratulations on advancing to the interview stage of the Great Song Guangzhou Special Municipality Civil Service Examination. You will now answer three questions within fifteen minutes. Questions will be read aloud to you. There is paper and pen before you for taking notes. You may only begin answering after hearing 'Begin your answer.' After completing your answer, you must state: 'Answer complete.' Otherwise no score will be given! Does the candidate understand?"

"Understood!" Zeng Juan said loudly again.

"Very well, let us begin. Please listen to Question One: Why did you apply for the Great Song Senate's civil service examination? What do you believe is the spirit of the Senate's civil service examination, and how does it differ from the Pseudo-Ming's imperial examinations? Begin your answer."

Hearing this question, Zeng Juan mentally exclaimed that this was bad—what looked like one question was actually three questions. It was a chain question! His luck was quite poor, but he steadied his nerves, began writing an outline on the paper, and then answered:

"Respected examiners, this candidate begins his answer. I chose to take the Great Song civil service examination for several reasons. First, I saw hope—hope that I never saw under the Pseudo-Ming. Under the Great Song Senate's governance, the common people's lives improve day by day. As long as one is willing to work hard, everyone can be self-sufficient. The Senate has reformed customs, swept away all the backward rules, systems, and customs of the old Pseudo-Ming, transforming Qiongzhou and Guangzhou into the only peaceful paradise in all the Nine Provinces. As someone who has personally experienced this, I feel I cannot stand apart—I too want to contribute to the Senate's great enterprise. Second, there are practical considerations. I am the only son in my family. I have elderly parents to care for and my late elder sister's orphaned child to raise. I need this well-paying job to be self-sufficient and contribute to my family! As for the spirit of the Great Song civil service examination, I believe it can be summarized as: the fighting spirit of courageously striving for the Senate; the learning spirit of hardship, diligence, and endeavor; the sacrificial spirit of giving one's life for the Great Song and the people; and the combat spirit of initiative, liveliness, and readiness to attack! The essential difference from the Pseudo-Ming imperial examinations is that the Pseudo-Ming examinations were held for the private interests of their Zhu family alone, while the Great Song civil service examination serves all the people under heaven! Examiner, this candidate has completed Question One!"

Finishing Question One, Zeng Juan let out a long breath. This question was truly difficult to answer. Thanks to Zhang Yu's textbook, he had at least managed a fluent response.

Elder Ai was very pleased with this answer. Such political awareness—excellent! He even mistakenly thought this was a naturalized citizen trained at the Lingao schools. He nodded with satisfaction and continued: "Candidate, please listen to Question Two. Please calculate the following: (267+876+890)×12-678+556=? You may ask the proctor for an abacus."

Arithmetic! This was not difficult for Zeng Juan. He asked the proctor for an abacus, quickly wrote down the problem from memory, and with a rapid *click-clack-click-clack*, Zeng Juan produced the answer: "Respected examiners, the answer is 24,274! This candidate has completed his answer!"
