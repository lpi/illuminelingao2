# Chapter 1846 - Currency Credit

Except for retail at the storefront and some wholesale and small-amount purchases where cash could still be used, the payment settlement between them and upstream and downstream major customers had already begun to adopt the "bill-based" settlement mode.

As a result, what Zhang Yu's father, the legal representative of Zhang's Food Company, saw regarding "money" was bills. A major task for him every day was stamping and signing, watching bills come in one by one and go out one by one. This gave Zhang Yu's father, who had played with silver and copper coins for decades, a severe sense of insecurity.

In private, he couldn't help but mutter to his precious son—is there any certainty in this Australian business?

The issuance of new currency was an important measure of the Senate's administration in Guangzhou. The public opinion network responsible to Senator Qin naturally had to make corresponding deployments. Especially since Zhang Yu himself came from a merchant family, he naturally had more say.

This was more complex than just saying some "gossip" just now. Not only to "propagate" it out but also to "persuade" others. Zhang Yu pondered that just saying the words from the weekly public opinion training wasn't enough; he needed more persuasive rhetoric.

"Boss He, whether this Great Song's Treasure Note is reliable or not, I dare not say," Zhang Yu said eloquently, "But do you think the Australians are reliable in handling matters?"

"There's indeed nothing to say about this." Boss He nodded, "Although I do small capital business and haven't done any business with the Australians, I've heard people say that Australians are most trustworthy in business. They neither bully people with power nor delay payment or pass off shoddy goods as good ones."

"That's it." Zhang Yu knew that this tea house boss actually had a very good impression of the Australians. Because this place was close to Chengxuan Street, yamen runners and public servants, servants of wealthy families, and various city fox and society rats clinging around these people often frequented this place. He didn't have any big threshold (backer) to rely on, so he couldn't avoid their extortion. Occasionally, if the service wasn't thorough, they would smash bowls and tables. He could only swallow his anger and greet them with a smile.

After the Australians arrived, the market immediately cleared up. Police patrolled the streets, rectifying public security. Not only did the city fox and society rats dare not cause trouble, but even the Australians' own public servants and runners paid according to the price when drinking tea in the shop. There was absolutely no phenomenon of eating, wiping their mouths, shouting "put it on the tab," and leaving. For this, Boss He had raised his thumb for a long time.

With such a foundation, persuading him wasn't too difficult. Just starting from the Australians' benevolent acts and virtuous governance would do.

"...Think about it, since the Australians are people who value trust and righteousness, how could they fake things in this matter of money and ruin their own reputation?" Zhang Yu said, "If the Australians wanted to seek wealth, this Guangzhou is their world. Just entering the city for roughly three days, how much gold, silver, and treasure could they not get? Why use such means to accumulate wealth?"

Boss He seemed somewhat persuaded, but after all, this concerned money and wealth. Silver and copper coins accustomed to for so many years now turning into a piece of paper wasn't something that could be explained through simply with a few sentences.

"Furthermore, the circulation certificate has been circulating in Qiongzhou Prefecture for a long time, and was occasionally seen in Guangzhou in the past. Although not widely used locally, it has been circulating unimpeded in Qiongzhou for many years, and I haven't heard of it becoming waste paper—there are quite a few people in the city who have been to Lingao for business—you must have heard of it."

Shopkeeper He had indeed heard many tea guests talk about the "Australian Circulation Certificate," but at that time it was just listened to as a strange anecdote. He never thought that one day the Australians would use it in Guangzhou too. Speaking of which, indeed no one said there was a problem with the circulation certificate—those who went to do business back then, although they had to exchange silver for circulation certificates when going, never heard of any difficulty in exchanging back to silver when leaving. He was somewhat moved and nodded slightly unconsciously.

"Besides, for small business people like us, how much silver can we touch? Busy all day long, besides earning some broken silver, isn't what we receive all kinds of copper coins—tell me, how much more valuable are these copper coins than the Australians' subsidiary coin certificates?"

This point was very crucial. Although the Great Ming didn't have the saying "bad money drives out good money," this law was already effective in the market. The copper coins everyone took out to spend were almost all bad coins that were thin and light, and would even break in half if dropped on the ground. Good money with sufficient weight was rarely seen.

To say what value such copper coins had, it was better to say it was the credit formed by everyone being accustomed to using standard coins for many years—everyone recognized it as a kind of "money."

Neither Zhang Yu nor Shopkeeper He understood the definition of currency, but these simple principles weren't impossible to figure out.

"...Furthermore, Shopkeeper He, when you were tight on hand in the past, didn't you also make tea chips to give change to tea guests and settle accounts with noodle shops and vegetable vendors? You say, what are those chips made of bamboo worth? Don't they rely on the credit you accumulated opening a shop here for many years!"

Shopkeeper He slapped his thigh: "Ayu, I understand! In the end, whether it's this Australian Treasure Note or standard coin, everyone being able to use it relies on credit!"

"Exactly." Zhang Yu nodded, "A man cannot stand without trust. In this world today, who has the most credit?"

Shopkeeper He couldn't help sighing with emotion: "Ayu, what you said makes sense. You are indeed educated, seeing things clearly."

"Where, where," Zhang Yu said modestly, "This is just a little insight of mine. Besides, the subsidiary coin certificate can also be exchanged for silver dollars. If you are really not assured, gather one thousand wen of notes and go exchange for a silver dollar immediately? You should be assured holding silver dollars."

"Exactly, exactly," Shopkeeper He nodded repeatedly, "Why didn't I think of that! It is clearly written on the exchange notice. Truly confused! Now I am assured."

Seeing it was getting late, Zhang Yu took his leave and went out. He saw Zeng Juan already starting to lecture on the serial report of the Social Life Section outside: "The Chronicle of Mingnu's Disappearance."

Although the Mao Family Inn case was solved because of tracing Mingnu's whereabouts, the Mingnu case itself didn't have much criminal investigation content. However, its social significance was great. Minister Ding thought this was an excellent subject to publicize the superiority of the Senate system and expose the dark atrocities of human trafficking in the Ming Kingdom, preparing to make the Mingnu Disappearance Case into a 17th-century "Madeleine Disappearance Case." The Propaganda Department engaged in a large-scale special promotion for this, highlighting that common people under Senatorial rule "enjoy peace" and "have human rights."

So the report on this case, planned by several pen-pushers in the cultural and propaganda department, turned into a long serialized report.

Wen Desi, who rarely appeared publicly in Guangzhou, also specially wrote and published an article titled "Every Child is a Child of the Senate" in "Yangcheng Express," fueling the entire news propaganda.

Exaggerated by the long newspaper report, the Mingnu Disappearance Case unexpectedly became a hotly discussed matter on Guangzhou streets—if the Mao Family Inn case weren't so thrilling, snatching the number one topic in tea houses would be out of the question.

Seeing Zeng Juan reading the newspaper with head shaking and brain swaying, just talking about Gao Chongjiu and Li Ziyu going to the tea house to investigate "earnestly and kindly" while Mingnu's parents refused to tell her whereabouts, he couldn't help smiling slightly. Ayu is prosperous this time, even appearing in the newspaper! Thinking of this, he was sincerely happy for his little buddy.

At this moment, in the "lounge" of the General Manager's office suite in Purple Lightning Tower, Guangzhou, Pei Lixiu wore a hollowed-out silk nightgown, half-lying and half-leaning on a genuine leather sofa, her breast half-exposed, looking lazy.

She hadn't yet recovered from the alcohol of the noon banquet. Pei Lixiu had just returned from Lingao. Shortly after Guangzhou was recovered, she was recalled to Lingao. Contrary to the suspicious claims of "Chief Pei was recalled to be punished" or "already thrown into jail" by naturalized employees of the Guangzhou Station, she actually went back to discuss the specific plan for reorganizing Purple Lightning Tower into Purple Lightning Tower Entertainment Co., Ltd. with Li Mei, who was responsible for commercial work.

Purple Lightning Tower had been in Guangzhou for many years, carving out a new path among traditional brothels with the "Australian style of enjoyment," becoming the most profitable enterprise of the Guangzhou Station. The huge prospect of this "smokeless industry" naturally wouldn't be ignored by the Commerce Department. Considering that merely running a "leisure clubhouse" faced a too narrow potential customer base, after several considerations, Minister of Commerce Li Mei proposed using Purple Lightning Tower as the leading enterprise to engage in a comprehensive entertainment company. At the same time, expanding into chain operations.

During the few months in Lingao, she didn't stop her hooves (worked non-stop), running around departments everywhere, discussing cooperation, asking for policies, talking to designers, looking at samples in factories... bent on taking Purple Lightning Tower to a higher level.

Expanding business scope and opening chain brands required large investments. Relying on financial appropriation was naturally hopeless. Fortunately, Guangzhou was engaging in a big rectification of the sex industry. The original official brothels were enemy property and naturally had to be confiscated. In the process of rectifying the sex industry, "fighting tigers" to set up examples and establish prestige was inevitable. Once these few "big tigers" were finished, the properties left behind could be taken over conveniently. Not to mention the ready-made human resources...

It was under such circumstances that Pei Lixiu hurried back to Guangzhou from Lingao to officially start her work.

At this time, she had been officially appointed as the General Manager of Purple Lightning Tower and Representative of the Senate. Pei Lixiu had no complaints about her General Manager appointment. Ming Lang and Li Mei originally thought she might feel a bit lost just becoming a SOE general manager after Guangzhou was recovered—after all, even Zheng Shangjie became the Director of the Guangzhou Commerce Bureau.

However, Pei Lixiu didn't see it that way. Being able to return to Purple Lightning Tower to presume over work satisfied her. Her political ambition was limited, and she knew where her abilities lay. Besides, compared to Lingao, she was more familiar with Guangzhou. Purple Lightning Tower was not only where her career started, condensing a lot of her painstaking effort, but also the bond of her main external social relations... The heritage of Guangzhou as the number one city in the southern sky was different from the upstarts in Lingao after all. Some local new rich in Lingao often made Pei Lixiu roll her eyes to the back of her head. The scions of aristocratic families in Guangzhou were still more to Pei Lixiu's liking.
