# Chapter 1843 - New Opportunity

"China Current Affairs Section, Item One—"

In the small tea house, Zeng Juan held a newspaper and was reading it. Dozens of tea guests around him were all listening intently.

This job of reading newspapers in the tea house was introduced to him by Zhang Yu. Since Zhang Yu's family got a loan to expand their business scale, his life of reading newspapers for extra income couldn't continue due to lack of time. Moreover, he didn't care for this small money anymore. So he recommended Zeng Juan—reading newspapers required not only literacy but also understanding the countless "News speak vocabulary" in the newspapers. Ordinary scholars could only read the words but were ignorant of the meaning, so this job had to be done by someone "versed in Aussie affairs."

In the past, he read nothing more than storybook novels and legends of the strange from Australian publications. But since the Australians occupied Guangzhou, more and more people had a strong interest in this freshly baked "Great Song," and also paid attention to the Australians' various administrative measures—after all, their various actions in the city were closely related to the lives of the broad masses of citizens.

People like Zeng Juan became very popular. Not only did ordinary petty citizens look at him differently, but even some nearby big households were very polite when seeing him. Some even took newspapers and copied announcements to ask him to explain the content of the articles above.

"The rogue bandit leader Li Zicheng's unit, which participated in breaking Fengyang, excavating the Ming Imperial Family's ancestral graves, and burning the Huangjue Temple where Zhu Yuanzhang once became a monk at the beginning of the year, is confirmed to have invaded the Guanzhong Plain this month. Ming Commander Hong Chengchou fought multiple battles with this unit but failed to achieve decisive victory. Our newspaper's observer believes the Li Zicheng unit should be maneuvering towards Xianyang and attempting to besiege Xianyang City..."

"Because some rogue bandits moved towards the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal area, the Ming Court, worried that the canal grain transport would be destroyed by rogue bandits, has officially issued a document ordering all grain transport from the Jiangsu and Zhejiang regions this year to be concentrated in Shanghai County, and then transported by sea to Tianjin Wei..."

"International Current Affairs Section, Item One..."

"The British merchant ship that entered Macau this month brought unexpected news. In mid-April this year, the British East India Company reached an agreement with the Portuguese Governor of Goa in India. The Portuguese side promised that British merchant ships could enter and leave freely, enjoying the treatment of Portuguese merchant ships in terms of taxation and material supply; at the same time, the British East India Company promised to sell military supplies such as gunpowder to Portuguese colonies in Goa, Ceylon, and other Indian regions, and to transport Australian-Song produced arms products stored by Portugal in Macau... Our newspaper's observer believes that the colonial struggle between the Netherlands and Portugal in India, Borneo, and the Lombok Islands will heat up day by day, while the Spanish Kingdom government, which nominally rules Portugal simultaneously, seems indifferent to this. This move by Britain fully illustrates that Britain is not satisfied with the Netherlands' actions in the Asian region..."

"The Joseon Li Dynasty, disregarding our Senate's repeated tolerance on the issue of Jeju's ownership and ignoring the fact that Jeju Island has been our territory since ancient times, recently dispatched ships and soldiers again to harass our Jeju territory. Our Jeju garrison dealt a head-on blow, completely wiping out the invading enemies. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently issued a solemn warning, hoping the Li Dynasty will not go further and further down the wrong path...

"The recently risen legendary figure in Manila, Count Van Nanuowa (Van Nanuwa/Villanueva?), has recently started a business. He circled a dedicated development zone on the southeast coast of Palawan Island. Can this 'gold digger' who once miraculously excavated gold mines in multiple places reproduce the miracle this time? This newspaper specially interviewed several Spanish captains resting in Macau..."

"Great Song Liberated Area Current Affairs Highlights, Item One..."

"The main body of the first clipper trade clipper has been completed at the Hong Kong Shipyard and can enter the outfitting stage late this month. This ship will soon be put into the trade route between the Great Song and Europe."

"Yesterday, the 8th Vocational Skills Grading Examination concluded successfully. Examination results will be posted for public notice late this month. The trades involved in this exam include fitter, turner, electrician... The 9th Vocational Skills Grading Examination will be held in October this year. It is reported that this exam will set up three new test centers in Jeju, Kaohsiung, and Guangzhou outside of Lingao and Sanya in Hainan Province for the first time, to facilitate local personnel taking the exam..."

"This month, the Sanya Telegraph Exchange General Station was completed, marking the full completion of the Hainan province-wide round-island telegraph project. Telegraph transmission and reception tests will be conducted in the near future. After being put into operation, messages from the ends of the earth can be transmitted to Lingao and Haikou in just a few minutes..."

"Good news came from the Jeju Island State-run Horse Farm. All foals born in this batch have survived."

...

"Local Highlights, Item One..."

"Mayor Liu inspected the renovation site of the former Examination Hall (Gongyuan) today. After renovation, this place will serve as the Guangzhou Municipal School of Administration, responsible for the training and further education of cadres in Guangzhou and the entire Guangdong province..."

"Several more suspects in the Mao Family Inn Mass Murder Case have been caught. The Police Bureau stated that some suspects are still fleeing. It is hoped that the broad masses of people will heighten their vigilance, pay attention to whether there are suspicious people and events around them at all times, and report to the local Pail-Jia or nearest police station in time. The police organ will give certain rewards to those who provide useful information and catch suspects..."

After Dingding arrived in Guangzhou, the layout of the "Yangcheng Express" expanded significantly, adding multiple sections such as international, domestic, and cultural life. Of course, most content was still reprinted from the "Lingao Times," but certain efforts were also spent on gathering and editing local news.

Because this newspaper not only involved various orders and policies of the Senate in Guangzhou but was also rich and colorful in content, loved by the people, and very entertaining to the impoverished lives of citizens, the newspaper's influence spread easily.

Although there weren't many current affairs sections, there was quite a lot of news. Zeng Juan read them out one by one, taking a full hour.

Not to mention reading the newspaper made his mouth dry and tongue parched, many people still had questions for him to explain after reading.

"Ajuan, what is this telegram thing? How can it transmit letters?"

"Where is this Jeju Island? Why do Koreans want to fight with us?"

"The civil service exam is the imperial exam opened by the Australians, right?"

...

Zeng Juan explained them one by one. For some he didn't know himself, he had to bullshit casually to fool them. But what everyone was most interested in was still the Mao Family Inn case.

"Is there any follow-up on the Mao Family Inn case besides arresting escaped criminals?"

Zeng Juan shook his head: "No new news today."

Since the Mao Family Inn case occurred, it had been the topic of gossip for Guangzhou citizens over tea and meals. The case summary serialized in the newspaper became the news tea guests paid most attention to recently.

Seeing everyone was somewhat disappointed and had no new questions, he then said:

"Today's domestic and foreign current affairs sections are done. I'm going to rest for one shichen, oh, two hours, then read the life section." Zeng Juan wiped the sweat from his forehead and drank a bowl of Chen Liji's herbal tea in big gulps. Ignoring the noisy circle of listeners around him, he walked straight to the back hall. He picked up a fan made of palm leaves and fanned himself properly for a few minutes. Composing himself slightly, he delayed no further, took out a "Public Basic Knowledge Manual" from the drawer, and began reviewing.

"Ajuan! You are indeed here!"

While Zeng Juan was shaking his head and memorizing by rote, a familiar voice came over. Zeng Juan looked up and saw his classmate and good friend Zhang Yu, carrying a food box in his hand.

"Ayu, you came to deliver tea food again? It's too expensive! Don't send anymore; you are operating on a small capital after all..."

"Spirit is high when happy events occur." Zhang Yu smiled, "Take this to Ayu's later and let Mingnu taste it—you must be tired of walnut cakes. What I'm sending now is a new gadget." Zhang Yu deliberately stopped halfway, whetting Zeng Juan's appetite.

Zeng Juan didn't show a greedy look but sighed: "It's all thanks to Brother Ziyu this time!" Speaking of this, his eyes immediately turned red. A few days ago, Li Ziyu sent someone to say Mingnu had been found. He ran all the way to Li Ziyu's house, holding Mingnu and crying bitterly—he never thought he had such deep feelings for this niece. The Australian books said: You only know what is most precious after losing it regarding everything. In this moment, he had an unforgettable feeling about this.

Besides gratitude and happiness, Zeng Juan was secretly ashamed. he was also a seven-foot man, a person who had read books and understood reason. In a matter concerning his closest kin, he was completely powerless. If Li Ziyu hadn't exhausted his full strength, Mingnu would most likely not have been found.

In any case, he must pass the Australian civil service exam to have a chance to repay Li Ziyu's kindness in the future. Because of this, he had become increasingly "diligent" these few days, bringing review materials even when coming out to earn money.

"Ayu is truly loyal!" Zhang Yu said, "There is another happy event. I received a letter from Shixin yesterday!"

"Oh?!" Now Zeng Juan's eyes widened—Guangzhou was still Great Ming's when Chen Shixin went to Lingao—"How is he in Lingao?"

"He said in the letter that after arriving in Lingao, recommended by Chief Hong, he is now learning painting with a Westerner. No tuition needed, and the Australians even give him living expenses. Life is quite good. The Australians said they need people who can paint very much. After completing the study, there will naturally be rice to eat. Tell us not to worry. He will return to Guangzhou recently to visit his parents, and we will gather then."

"I didn't expect Shixin to also prosper." Zeng Juan said. While happy for his friend, he felt a strong sense of anxiety and unease about his own "mediocrity" until now.

Market rumors said: When China prospers, the Senators are imperial. The arrival of the Australians brought a lot of opportunities. His little buddies caught them one by one, but he still had nothing...

"When he comes back, we must gather properly and drink a big cup!" Zhang Yu, immersed in the yearning for a beautiful future, hummed the latest Australian ditty: "Today is a good day..."

Zeng Juan wasn't as happy as him. He had other thoughts: with only two hours of rest time, he had to hurry up and memorize books. Turning his head, he started reading a paragraph and memorizing a paragraph again.
