# Chapter 2071 - Outside Help

Outside Guangzhou's northern gate stood White Cloud Mountain, where scattered peaks and ridges rose and fell—not particularly high, but green and luxuriant, with winding paths through shady woods. Ascending its heights, one could survey the entire city, the Pearl River threading silver through it all. This scenic landscape had, since ancient times, been renowned as one of the Eight Sights of Yangcheng—"Mount Baiyun in Evening Glow"—and was dotted with famous monasteries.

The Yongtai Temple was built amid this splendid scenery. Nicknamed the "Eunuch Temple," it had been founded with donations from Wei Juan, a powerful eunuch who served as Superintendent of Maritime Trade Inspectorate in Guangzhou during the Chenghua reign, and had received an imperial inscription from the Chenghua Emperor himself. Thanks to this connection, the temple not only boasted magnificent buildings but had remained one of Guangzhou's largest religious landholders for over a hundred and fifty years.

Hao Er alighted from his sedan before the temple gates and led his servants inside. He was a "distinguished benefactor" here; the moment he entered, a young novice scurried off to report, and the guest-receiving monk came to greet him.

He paid his respects to the Buddha in the main hall, offered incense, and donated clothing and foodstuffs. While making polite conversation with the guest-monk, he observed his surroundings. When the moment seemed right, he inquired, "Has a guest surnamed Li—a visitor from out of town—arrived here recently?"

The monk confirmed that indeed, an extended family of men and women, old and young, had come from afar to burn incense and fulfill a vow. They had rented a small courtyard in the rear compound.

"This is a distinguished guest of mine, come to Guangzhou especially to worship. Would the master be so kind as to announce me?"

Famous temples often maintained refined quarters and courtyards where wealthy patrons could lodge during pilgrimages—essentially high-class guesthouses. For a merchant like Hao Er to have visiting guests staying here was not unusual. The monk suspected nothing and led him there.

Upon announcement, a voice from within invited him to enter.

Hao Er, accompanied by his personal attendant, stepped into the courtyard. A servant was already waiting in the yard, all smiles, and escorted them into the main hall.

In the center of the main room stood a rosewood Eight Immortals table. Five or six people sat around it; one man stood on the left—the same messenger who had delivered a letter to Hao Er's shop a few days ago. On the right, another man rose to greet him, his face familiar. This person stepped forward.

Hao Er cupped his fists and bowed. "Might I ask which of you gentlemen is 'Fourth Master'?"

The man laughed. "Hao Er, it's been three years—have you forgotten your old friend Meng?"

Hao Er studied the speaker: he wore a sky-blue Suzhou silk Daoist robe, a scholar's square-cloth cap, and no jade or stone ornaments—about forty years of age, with the appearance of a steward. His round face bore the shrewdness of a seasoned merchant.

Musing to himself— *Three years ago? His accent is from the Hui-Zhe region. Three years ago I went to Anhui to negotiate paper and ink transactions. His surname is Meng—could he be connected to that venerable family...?* —he said aloud, almost involuntarily: "Could you possibly be Steward Meng of the Cloud-Black Studio?"

Steward Meng's face brightened three degrees further. "Indeed! I am your humble servant Meng Guolu. As for Fourth Master's affairs, there's no rush—let me first introduce you to several senior masters." He gestured toward the standing figure. "This is Young Hero Wang Su of Qingcheng, styled Quji. You've already met him when he delivered the letter. Most zealous against evildoers, he is. Quji, would you please stand watch at the door for a while?"

Wang Su, a man of few words, cupped his fists and stepped outside.

Meng Guolu then turned to address the room: "Second Master Hao, given name Fang, courtesy name Jinzhi—a man of public spirit and loyal service to the throne. He is an expert in calligraphy, antiques, and fine arts. Our great undertaking of counterfeiting Song-era treasury notes shall largely rest on his shoulders."

The room immediately filled with cries of "Long admired!"

Meng Guolu then introduced each person in turn.

The elderly gentleman at the center of the group had a head of pure white hair and beard, yet remained remarkably vigorous. This was the famous "Pattern Li"—Li Furen, once an engraver of coin molds at the Ministry of Works' Treasury Bureau. He specialized in crafting the *mother coins* from which all provincial mints derived their coinage. Although each province cast its own coins, all were required to follow the "mother coins" issued by the Ministry of Revenue. Thus, the making of these "mother coins" was of paramount importance.

"Pattern Li" had served forty-some years at the Ministry of Revenue; the mother coins for every reign of coinage had passed through his hands. He had retired to enjoy his old age in recent years, and most of the craftsmen currently working at the Ministry of Revenue's Treasury Bureau were his disciples and grand-disciples.

Such master artisans, who made their living by skill, held little status in the early Ming, but those who rose to become master craftsmen in imperial service naturally carried a certain pride. They were accustomed to meeting high officials and grand secretaries with equanimity. Li merely smiled, bowed slightly, and said, "This old man, Li Fugui—taking the liberty of seniority—has, on this excursion from the capital, learned to call himself a 'merchant gentleman.' Please don't laugh."

On the old man's left sat an elderly lady, calm and composed, holding a string of prayer beads like a devout lay Buddhist. Astonishingly, this was the rather mysterious "Chaotic Brush Liu." Hao Er was somewhat startled and couldn't help looking at her twice. The old lady raised her eyes with a faint smile: "This humble woman has made a modest name repairing paintings and mending calligraphy—earning her bread in the great houses. Who would have thought that at this late age I'd be dispatched on an imperial mission? My nephew here specializes in Song-era books and paintings. Please, Jinzhi, do guide him well."

Her speech, though Mandarin, carried the soft lilt of Wu-accented dialect.

A slender man of about thirty rose to pay his respects: "I am Liu Cheng, courtesy name Jinong—friends call me 'Youyou Studio.' Second Master Hao, your family's imitation of Plum Daoist's *Spring Voyage on Cloud Dream Lake* was the talk of the capital—was that your handiwork?"

Hao Er replied, "I dare not claim it. That was my uncle's work; my son merely ground the ink and added a stroke or two. Alas! If given time, his talent in painting would have surpassed mine a hundredfold." His eyes reddened as he spoke.

He was about to say more when Meng Guolu interjected: "Your grievance is known to us all. During the great plague, your young master was wrongfully seized by the Australian pirates and thrown into some quarantine camp—a fine young man, just gone like that. Alas! Along the way here, how many families like Second Master's and yours, Hao Er, have been ruined and destroyed? As for Young Hero Wang outside—his family once dealt in Sichuan salt, a thriving business. But the Ma'ao salt has crossed the seas and is now sold in six provinces. Before their eyes, a clan of several hundred souls fell into ruin. Truly, until the Australian pirates are exterminated, the troubles will never end."

The others murmured agreement: "When the hairy pirates first came, they still traded peaceably, peddling exotic goods from the Arabian shores. Who knew they would see our honesty as weakness, burn our homes, cut off our livelihoods, and carry off our people? Heaven and Earth above, all spirits and gods should curse them!"

Surrounded by these fellow travelers, hearing their sympathetic words, Hao Er felt warmth in his heart. He had undertaken this dangerous enterprise out of a mix of self-interest, obligation, and personal vengeance. Yet working alone undercover in Guangzhou, watching as one ally after another was discovered and executed by the Australian pirates, even in his midnight dreams he could not help but feel as though he were adrift in icy waters.

On the other side, a middle-aged man had already risen and said: "To dwell among virtuous men is like entering a room full of orchids. Jinzhi's willingness to risk all and sacrifice his family fortune for this cause is truly admirable. I am Lin Qiangyun; my family deals in paper."

Hao Er hastily replied: "I have long admired the renowned Tribute Paper Lin family. I regret never having the chance to visit. Three years ago, I was preparing to travel and discuss the paper trade with you, but the endless wars prevented it."

Lin Qiangyun's expression darkened: "Were it not for the Australian pirates throwing the southeast into chaos, it would never have come to this. They've broken the brokers' guilds, dumped their paper on the market at ruinous prices. These days, throughout the two Guangs, Fujian, and Zhejiang, the Tribute Paper Lin family is nothing but yesterday's wilted flower."

Beside him, another middle-aged man with the look of an old farmer counseled: "Since we bear the royal commission to deal with the Australian pirates, let us set aside our anger, Qiangyun."

Meng Guolu then introduced him: "This is 'Block-Carving King' Wang Dou. And this here is 'Living-Bug Zhao'—Zhao Jiaren."

After all had exchanged courtesies, they invited Hao Er to sit and served him tea.

Only then did Meng Guolu explain: "Fourth Master has been out and about these past few days. First, to liaise with the old local hands and gather funds and supplies. Second, he learned that Seventh Master in Lingao and Sorcerer Wu in Guangzhou have both been captured, and several gentry families in Guangzhou have suffered extermination. We must now proceed with the utmost caution, and he cannot appear openly. Earlier, when you were burning incense in the main hall, Fourth Master observed you from a distance. Having returned and spoken with us, we are now without doubt."

After a few polite exchanges, everyone shared news. Hao Er said: "Since the Australian pirates occupied Guangzhou, they have begun to seize the wealth of temples and monasteries. All the major and minor Daoist temples in Guangzhou now fall under the jurisdiction of some 'True Master' of the Grand Song Daoist Yunji Sect at the Temple of the Five Immortals. They have also colluded with the Red-Haired foreigners to requisition land and buildings below Yuexiu Mountain, to build some grand cathedral. It seems all religious orders will be brought under Australian control. Buddhism too cannot escape this calamity. Although this temple is a fine place, it is not safe to stay long. And coming and going is inconvenient—the Australian spies are everywhere in the inns. Would it not be better for everyone to lodge temporarily at my residence?"

Meng Guolu said: "Jinzhi, you are most thoughtful. But I have heard from Stone Elder: the net in Guangzhou grows ever tighter. Though we pretend to be one family, we are not truly related. Eventually our cover will be seen through. Moreover, this undertaking creates quite a stir; over time, concealment will become impossible. Even you, Jinzhi, should not continue to manage affairs from within the city. Fourth Master has already made contact with local connections and purchased a workshop compound outside the county seat. By the way, for our party, we have all adopted the surname Li, with the household head being Li Fugui. Once preparations are complete and the paper and ink materials arrive, we shall relocate there and stay a while."
