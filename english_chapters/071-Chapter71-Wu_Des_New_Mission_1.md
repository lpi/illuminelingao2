# Chapter 71 - Wu De's New Mission (1)

The officials and gentry were still not at ease, so they sent someone to deliver a letter to Regional Commander Tang in Qiongshan, probing whether he could be moved to suppress the bandits.

Licentiate Liu placed high hopes on the harassment tactics, but received no support from the militia corps heads of various villages. The militias were unwilling to fight; everyone heard that the militia of Huang Family Stockade had suffered a defeat even in an ambush with superior numbers, so morale was even lower.

Magistrate Wu used both intimidation and promises, but the militias of various families were still unwilling to go. They also held a thought: these people came ashore but haven't been seen robbing, killing, or burning houses. Even if they want to build roads or attack the city, it's attacking the county seat, what does it have to do with them? If they went to fight and instead angered the pirates to come for revenge, what then? The militias' homes are all in the countryside, unlike the masters who can hide in the city. Forced by circumstances, they went reluctantly, circled around from afar and came back. As for the corps heads of various villages, as long as their homes and properties were not near the county seat, they were not enthusiastic about this. The militias were either fellow villagers or clansmen, or their own tenants and long-term laborers; if they died fighting, who would farm the land? What Lingao lacked was labor, so they did not seriously supervise the militias to fight.

The frequent appearance of militias along the construction site attracted the attention of the sent out scouts. Because the beach camp had already taken shape and didn't need too many guards, the Military Team personnel, apart from keeping a three-man observation post under Lingao county seat, invested all other members into the guard of the road construction site.

Along the road section, a lookout tower was built every 3 kilometers. Each tower was guarded by a lookout sentry equipped with high-power binoculars and a walkie-talkie. Below the tower were simple fortifications built by the guard team, a man-high earthen wall surrounded by barbed wire outside. Inside the fortification were a four-wheel agricultural vehicle and a motorcycle, as well as a silicon 2-watt radio. Usually, the motorcycle was used to patrol back and forth between points along the construction site. Once an enemy attack was discovered at a certain point, the agricultural vehicle would be used as a rapid delivery tool to transport soldiers for reinforcement.

Having soldiers alone was not enough; the masses had to be mobilized. The construction team distributed a batch of SKS rifles and ammunition. Ensuring that at every work point, besides 1 Military Team guard, there were 4-5 armed workers. Once a sudden attack event occurred, the operation point could protect itself.

"Once you are attacked, do not run around in disorder. Fire on the spot after reporting, understand?" He Ming urged the persons in charge of various points on the construction site, "The mobile team will arrive within five minutes. If other points are attacked, you just need to report in time."

In this way, small groups of militias coming for reconnaissance could not even get close to the construction site during the day. As soon as any suspicious person was found approaching, it would be immediately notified to the construction site command, and the command would dispatch the patrolling off-road motorcycle to check. The guards didn't even need to fire; the roar of the motorcycle starting up was enough to make the other party flee in panic. The team members driving the motorcycles, on a whim, could even chase out very far until the other party ran out of strength and collapsed, then capture the person back—if not for Bei Wei worrying that this would be lured into an ambush by the enemy and strictly forbidding them to pursue, they could have caught a few more. Upon interrogation, it was all gibberish and language barrier, nothing could be asked out. Using the radio to call Xiong Buyou over as a translation officer—fortunately, the Lingao dialect hadn't changed much in hundreds of years—after some tossing about, they finally understood that they were ordered to come for reconnaissance. Apart from this, it was the old set of pleading for mercy saying they had an eighty-year-old mother above and an eight-year-old child below.

From the captives' mouths, the transmigrators roughly knew that because of their road-building actions, the county seat was already in a panic, preparing day and night for them to attack the city. That road building could make people afraid was a bit unexpected to the Executive Committee. Originally, it was expected that the city would have some preparations to expel them, but obviously, the Daming officials and gentry in Lingao were more afraid of them. This first-hand material gave the Executive Committee great confidence.

Because the number of captives was too small, it was originally intended to simply release them, but the Executive Committee thought this was an opportunity and could serve as a drill for large-scale acceptance and use of local labor in the future. So they were all kept.

With the "Ring ring" sound of the alarm clock, Wu De was woken up from his sleep. Looking at the clock, it was 9 am.

Yesterday he was on night duty until 4 am before sleeping. Now he could hardly open his eyes, but coming to ancient times was not for vacation, it was to "make a living". If he slept any longer, he probably wouldn't even have rice to eat by then.

As the commander of the fishing boat detachment, Wu De could have slept on the fishing boat with better conditions, but the Military Team was short of hands right now, and people from the navy system had to go to the front too, so he had to come ashore.

Being in the troops for many years and coming from a fisherman family since childhood, although he worked in the city after transfer, his rich experience gave him a lot of life experience. He disliked the tents unifiedly built by the Executive Committee as too small and crowded with people. So he discussed with the Medical Team, found a clearing in the woods near them, cleaned it up, went to the logging yard to find about 10 long wooden sticks less than 3 meters long, tied one end firmly with rope, spread the other end and stuck into the mud, surrounded the four sides with tarpaulin, leaving an opening for entry and exit, then covered the outside of the tarpaulin with reeds. A prototype of an Indian teepee had appeared in front of everyone. Then he dug drainage ditches around it, paved sand and plant ash inside the tent, and a decent nest appeared. This place was along the river and near the sea, with a good environment, and he could also conveniently watch his four fishing boats.

In order to save fuel, two of the four boats of the fishing boat team were kept in a state ready to move at any time, and the other two were temporarily sealed. One was used for fishing. The fish and shrimp resources here in Longhao Bay were very rich, and kelp and other edible seaweeds could also be caught. Wu Nanhai had been running around on the fishing boats recently, taking photos and recording in a small notebook whenever he saw things caught up.

The other one was used as a backup. A group of people stayed on the boat at all times, ready to respond to attacks from the sea at any time.

[He] got up, took an aluminum pot to carry a pot of plant ash to the river, rubbed his face, broke a tender willow branch and chewed it to rot as a toothbrush, incidentally rubbing his teeth too. Yesterday he was on night duty and repaired the lookout tower. He didn't use a sleeping bag at night, his body was already starting to ache, his nose was stuffed, and his head hurt a little.

Caught a cold, right? A bad thought emerged in his mind.

Touched his forehead, seemed no fever, fortunately. Broke a few willow branches, peeled off the bark, threw into his mouth and chewed. Willow bark is rich in salicylic acid. Although irritating to the stomach, it is indeed very effective against headaches and fever.

Coming to the river bathing spot, he took off his clothes naked and went into the water. Yesterday was too tired, didn't wash at all. With the current sanitary conditions, if not washing diligently, skin diseases would occur. This purely natural open-air bathhouse was another livelihood project completed by the Construction Team on D+1—a sandy bottom river bend with very shallow water was selected near the river mouth. An interception net was hung at the mouth of the bend, and the debris and silt inside were cleared away. The river bank was paved with sand dug from the beach. Originally, a screen or something was to be made, but later it was not done because it was troublesome. Every day at five or six o'clock after work, the scene of a group of men naked and chaotic inside was magnificent. Because Wu De was on shift duty, he didn't have the chance to join this fun. It is said that men bathing naked together can enhance mutual affection. Sometime he must take a bath with Committeeman Ma and others.

The water in the morning was a bit cool, Wu De couldn't help shivering. After wetting his body and hair, he washed his hair and body with the soap he brought. After washing, he washed his underwear and socks with plant ash—this is a very important hygiene issue! He was reluctant to use more soap. Although making soap is not some profound craft, looking at the chaotic situation right now, no soap factory would go into production in the short term. After wringing the clothes dry, he hung them on the tree near the tent nearby.

The camp canteen was supplied 24 hours a day. He had no interest in joining that fun. Besides, the canteen didn't supply anything worth eating, nothing more than some seafood: kelp soup, boiled squid, boiled shellfish, boiled prawns, boiled crabs... basically all boiled seafood. At first, everyone was full of interest and even quarreled over the size of the crabs. After eating for three or four consecutive days, they all meant to be a bit afraid of eating. Last night someone cooked a pot of instant noodles, which actually attracted many people to watch with drooling mouths—not eating seafood but wanting to eat instant noodles, really times have changed.

Wu De didn't care about taking seafood as meals, he just despised the guys cooking in the canteen for messing around and wasting good things. He came directly to a bay outside the camp. The reefs on the shore were densely covered with oysters and barnacles, good stuff ah... Took out a small knife, and in a short while pried off a few dozen. He didn't take much. These shellfish die when leaving water and stink when dead. Eating stinking guys would cause diarrhea until the sky is dark and earth is dark. Even living next to the infirmary, one shouldn't take such a risk. He sat directly on the reef, and with quick work, pried open the shells, ate all the meat and juice clean. Really fresh ah, those farmed guys compared to these, are too inferior.

Returned to the hut, took out underwear from the backpack and put it on—wearing this was still because there would be some women appearing on the beach more or less, otherwise he really wanted to be completely naked, the body dries faster. The water in the vacuum flask was gone. In the past few days, he boiled water himself. The machine condensate water piped from the ship had an indescribable taste, fortunately there were some tea leaves to suppress it. The canteen started supplying water a few days ago. The boiled water boiler supplied 24 hours was Wu De's favorite service, just that the smell of bleaching powder in the water was a bit heavy.

Brewed a cup of strong tea in the kitchen, feeling much more comfortable—wonder if Lingao produces tea. Even if it doesn't produce tea, the Agriculture Team should have considered such a basic crop, right?
"Chief Zhao, come have a piece of our Food Office's latest product?" The cook brought a piece of pitch-black thing.

"What is this?"

"Smoked fish, this is top-quality fish meat, smoked all night yesterday. The taste is definitely good."

Hard to refuse the kindness, so he had to take it. This fish meat was smoked overnight, moisture and oil were almost all smoked dry, black on the outside, hard to the touch, and the appearance was very terrifying.

The fish meat looked terrifying, and eating it was even more terrifying. This so-called smoked fish was actually smoked on the rack directly without being marinated with salt. The wood used for smoking was unknown what stuff it was. Eating it in the mouth was simply no different from chewing the willow just now. With the freshly brewed hot tea, he barely swallowed it.

After eating the fish, he gulped a few mouthfuls of tea, only then suppressing the urge to vomit.

"How is it, taste not bad, right?"

"Brother, what did you used to do in the past?" Wu De asked with difficulty.

"Me, studied biological engineering, my name is Hu Yicheng." This former logger, because of being good at animal anatomy, infiltrated the canteen to continue practicing his anatomy skills.
