# Chapter 9 - The Bursting of the Myth

Chapter 9 The Bursting of the Myth

The seventh year of Tianqi, 1627 AD.

This month, the Later Jin attacked Joseon, forcing Joseon to surrender. The eastern vassal state of the Great Ming fell into the hands of the Jurchens.

In May, Huang Taiji attacked Ningyuan and Jinzhou, and was repelled by the Ming army, known as the Ning-Jin Great Victory at the time. Huang Taiji thereby changed his strategy and decided to bypass the Ning-Jin - Shanhai Pass defense line and invade the pass directly to plunder. In the subsequent seventeen years of Chongzhen, they entered the pass five times. The living beings in the Central Plains were plunged into misery. The Great Ming rivers and mountains, which were already swaying in the wind and rain, suffered disasters upon disasters.

In July, Emperor Tianqi was critically ill. The Nine Thousand Years, who held power for a time, stepped on the end of the road. In November of this year, Wei Zhongxian's property was confiscated and he committed suicide. The destruction of the Eunuch Party brought a moment of hope to the political sky of the late Ming, but disappeared like a meteor. Cutting off a rotten sore cannot bring a patient who has long been festering all over back to life. The Great Ming - the last Central Plains dynasty of the Han people - was powerless to reverse the situation and stepped on the road to destruction.

The three people who traveled through time were speechless for a moment, and the atmosphere was somewhat heavy.

Master Gao coughed lightly, twisted his beard, and asked slowly: "Since the honored guests are maritime merchants, do you have goods to sell?"

Wen Desi and Xiao Zishan looked at each other - getting to the main topic. This look was keenly captured by Master Gao.

"We indeed have some goods we want to come and sell, only we are new here and don't know the channels..." Wen Desi pretended to be in a difficult position.

"Haha, this is easy to say," Master Gao laughed, "I have been managing foreign goods business in this Guangzhou city for many years. If your honored selves trust me, I can be of service in this matter."

"Then we will trouble Master Gao." Wen Desi was overjoyed.

"These are our samples." Xiao Zishan said softly, taking out items one by one from his backpack.

After seeing that powder box, Master Gao had great interest in these people's goods. First was the kind of powder box he had seen, only this one was a greasy light green. Then came a completely transparent glass cup with some nice patterns on it. Although the transparency of this cup was far higher than any cup Master Gao had seen, it did not exceed his cognitive range, so he was a bit disappointed. Next were several porcelain of various styles. The appearance and glaze color were not outstanding. Picking one up and weighing it, he felt it was very light. The hand feel was not the icy cold of porcelain either, so he knew it was not the same thing as porcelain. Just as he was thinking this item was not very valuable, Xiao Zishan seemed to know his thought and pushed several bowls and cups down to the ground. Master Gao was startled, but saw that these things did not smash into pieces on his square brick paved floor, but just spun a few circles, unharmed.

The servant at the side hurriedly picked up the things. Master Gao snatched them over and looked carefully for a long time. There were no cracks or chips at all. He thought to himself that these people's things were indeed strange.

Next were some transparent boxes, square and round, all equipped with lids that could be closed tightly. Although they looked very much like the glass vessels Master Gao bought from the Portuguese, they were much lighter and not afraid of falling.

There were also some shiny small knives, hooded cloaks made of material somewhat like glass but waterproof like oilcloth... all some strange things. Gao Ju looked at this table full of beautiful things, both surprised and happy in his heart. Happy that the goods taken out were all rare and strange things, which could be sold for a good price as soon as they changed hands. Afraid that these people acted sneakily and their background was unclear. After pondering for a moment, the desire to earn big money overwhelmed the worries. On second thought, he was doing this smuggling business with foreigners anyway, what did it matter if they were Portuguese or Australians. Since these few people had arrived at his mansion, there was no reason to push away the windfall.

"I don't know how much silver you want to sell these rare goods for?" Settling his mind, Master Gao asked cautiously.

Wen Desi pointed to the rare goods commonly used in time travel novels: glass cups, and said: "This cup, one thousand taels each."

According to the three people's thoughts, this fair and clean Ming Dynasty master should buy this rare treasure without hesitation. Unexpectedly, they saw his face full of astonishment, looking at them as if seeing a few madmen.

"This, is really too expensive." Master Gao shook his head repeatedly, "Such glass utensils, the Portuguese in Macao also sell them. Large glass bowls and bottles are only three taels each. Small ones are only one tael each. This cup..." Speaking, he shook his head repeatedly, implying at most three taels.

These few instantly felt like ice water was poured on their heads, looking at each other in dismay. It turned out the time travel must-kill product - glass cup is not valuable...

Xiao Zishan saw that this business couldn't be discussed further. Expecting that their own estimation was wrong, he arched his hands and said: "We have lived overseas for a long time and don't know the market price in your honorable place. Please enlighten us, Master Gao."

Gao Ju thought this meant they wanted me to make an offer myself. He pondered for a moment and gave the prices:

Powder box, ten taels of silver each.

Glass cup, one tael each.

Melamine bowls and plates, large ones five mace, small ones two mace. Spoons and the like, one mace.

Plastic lunch box, three taels each.

Plastic raincoat, one mace each piece.

Small knife, five mace each.

The traditional time travel huge profit divine weapon glass cup actually failed miserably! One thousand taels became one tael. This gap was really too big. Diamonds turned into glass.

Instead, the inconspicuous small plastic powder box suited the appetite of the Ming Dynasty merchant. It can be seen that when doing business, one can never take things for granted at any time. Xiao Zishan then asked about the sea trade in Guangzhou, incidentally fishing for the other party's opinion on their goods.

It turned out that the overseas trade in this Guangzhou city was monopolized by the Portuguese. No matter where foreign merchants came from, ships could only anchor in Macao, waiting for measurement and taxation, and then could sell goods. Only Portuguese merchants could enter Guangzhou city to conduct trade. There were thirty-six hongs in the city specializing in export, just doing business with them, ordering large quantities of porcelain, raw silk, white sugar and other various goods every year.

However, merchants like Master Gao on Haopan Street followed another path. This path, although Master Gao didn't say explicitly, Xiao Zishan had also read about it from later generations' documents.

What Master Gao was most interested in was the mirror in that powder box. He said that occasionally Portuguese also brought this thing. Large mirrors could reach hundreds of taels in price. Although their small mirrors were a bit small, they were much clearer and brighter than mirrors from the West. If there were larger sizes, the price would be easy to discuss. As for that "soft porcelain" - melamine bowls and plates, in terms of texture, hand feel and pattern, there was nothing extraordinary, only good in being light and unbreakable. "Soft glass bowl", which is the plastic lunch box, although unbreakable, was not as crystal clear as glass bowls. As for plastic raincoats and small knives, in Master Gao's view, they were just some playthings.

Everyone was ashamed: Even if we are proud of having hundreds of years more insight, we may not necessarily beat others.

In the conversation, Master Gao also probed in many ways, asking about the local customs of Australia. Xiao Zishan just perfunctorily said that his country esteemed blue, there were many skilled craftsmen in the country good at making strange and ingenious goods, the country was established by industry and commerce, the people liked empty talk, often established a party by themselves under a name, advocating opinions. However, they were a mob gathered like tiles, dissolving themselves after a short time. Asked who the lord of the country was, he said the country had a lord, named "Eight Feet", with a powerful minister below handling military and people's livelihood affairs, named "Little Rice". regardless of noble or base in the country, all bowed to a divine envoy named "Ah Da Mi". Master Gao clicked his tongue in wonder hearing this.

Talking all the way, the three had long forgotten the vigilance of not drinking tea cleanly. When getting up to leave, even the tea juice was drunk dry. This made Master Gao Ju despise them a bit in his heart. Before leaving, the transaction was settled. The "Australian Maritime Merchants" would supply the first batch of goods three days later, and also promised to bring more novel things over.

Only the departure of the three made Master Gao mutter greatly in his heart again: These three people refused to go out from the main gate, insisting on going to a secluded place in the backyard, and having people leave. Master Gao was uneasy and sent a bold and careful servant to watch from a distance: seeing the three looking around sneakily for a while, suddenly turning into a corner behind the wall. When the servant rushed up to check, they were already gone without a trace.

Note: The price of glass ware comes from Wang Shizhen's "Fengzhou Zabian". The original price unit was Guan. This was the price in the Jiajing years, but I can't find the price in the 17th century, so I use it as a substitute for now. Gentlemen, no need to delve deep. If anyone knows, please enlighten me.
