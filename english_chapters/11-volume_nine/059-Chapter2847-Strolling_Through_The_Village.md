# Chapter 2847 Strolling Through the Village

Tan Shuangxi's village was named "Outside-the-Field Village." This straightforward name told everyone it was very close to the salt field but didn't belong to it.

Outside-the-Field Village was an administrative village, composed of ten *paijia*. Each *paijia* was roughly equivalent to a natural village. The first *pai* where the Tans lived was the largest, and also where the village office was located. Because the original village population was larger, fewer migrants had been settled here. Two-thirds were still "old households." Walking down the streets, what reached his ears was mostly the Hokkien dialect common around Maniao.

Tan Shuangxi had heard from the elders that they and the salt field's stove households were all from Fujian. Only the stove households came according to court decree and had salt pans and troughs. They came "seeking a living" as "migrant farmers," able only to reclaim wasteland around the area to farm.

Lingao had plenty of wasteland, but unfortunately no decent rivers. Rainy season brought floods; dry season parched the crops. People who came seeking a living could barely maintain by irrigating from the Maniao River.

Tan Shuangxi's childhood had been hard, but not the hardest. His family could afford to build irrigation channels—during dry season they could draw river water to irrigate the fields. The worst off had to haul water from the river by ox cart or shoulder pole every day. The labor was so intense that people often coughed up blood or had bloody urine from carrying water.

After the Australians came, initially only the salt field benefited. Big windmills went up. They watched salt sellers get rich. Outside-the-Field villagers were green with envy, but without salt pans and troughs, they couldn't join the cooperative. They could only continue selling labor and doing hard work, watching stove households buy new clothes, build new houses, their wives and children all presentable. Everyone was deeply envious. Women wanted to marry into the salt field. Village boys were resentful.

Only after the Senators sent people to clarify taxes and set up the Heavenly Land Society did life in Outside-the-Field Village improve day by day. He didn't know much about how exactly it improved. He'd joined the army after the first county-wide assembly. But every time he came back, his hometown always gave him that "old face, new appearance" feeling.

Most houses were newly built—white walls and black tiles, the wall base painted black. Looking both elegant and dirt-resistant. Every household had a courtyard enclosed by hedges, with vegetables and fruit trees planted. Village roads were even paved with stone—something only the most prosperous salt field villages had in the past.

Since he was back in the village after so long, Tan Shuangxi wanted to visit old acquaintances. The village had many childhood playmates and teenage friends. But asking around this visit, these people had either left for work or moved their whole families to town. Very few remained in the village.

Yet every household he visited was empty. Made sense: with such fine weather, able-bodied adults were all in the fields. Who'd stay home?

He walked and stopped, eventually reaching the small river at village entrance. In the past, with poor security and bandits frequently about, a fortress gate had been built here. It was locked every evening, with someone on lookout duty around the clock to give warning.

But today when he walked there, no militia stood watch. Only some old folks and women sat in the gateway doing odd tasks, watching children and chattering. Seeing Tan Shuangxi approach, they all greeted him.

Tan Shuangxi knew his return had made him a "notable figure" in the village. The village's "news center" absolutely wouldn't let him go.

He didn't mind being the "focal point"—or rather, he rather enjoyed it. Tan Shuangxi had been "one of the crowd" for decades. Even in the military, only recently had he become the focus of a platoon.

He quietly tugged at his shirt hem, making his old uniform look more pressed. Actually, he'd already bought himself a new blue "national dress" suit and the fashionable Dutch fine linen white shirt in Bairen Town. But every time he went out, he deliberately wore his old uniform.

Military uniforms were replaced twice yearly during peacetime. A year of crawling, training, and duty wore them to tatters by the time they were retired. But anyone who could bring back an old uniform on leave would immediately become the village focus. So before each trip home, they'd specially wash it clean, have the women workers at the barracks service center carefully mend it, some even re-dye it.

Such an old uniform, whether given as a gift or worn as casual clothes at home, looked imposing. Speaking carried more weight too. As for veterans, they'd wear their old uniforms—symbols of their past glory—at every opportunity, also hanging their medals and commendations. Even without combat medals, they could at least hang the "Service to the Senate and the People Commemorative Medal" and length-of-service pins that every veteran got—show off a bit.

Tan Shuangxi naturally didn't need such medals to "pad things out." He had two Second-Class Merit and one Second-Class Valor. As for Third-Class Merit and Valor, he had several. Other medals too. He could hang a whole chestful if he wanted. To avoid seeming too deliberate or showy, he just had a "Chengmai Campaign" commemorative armband sewn onto all his old uniforms.

When everyone greeted him, he sat on the long bench by the fortress gate. Smiling, he waved off the Big Production cigarette the old man offered him:

"I'm the junior—how can I smoke your cigarettes? Smoke mine!" He pulled out a pack of White Holy Ship and passed them around.

Unlike the women who were just chatting for companionship while doing chores, the old men hanging around this "news center" at the fortress gate were all village "prominent figures"—mostly "respected elders" whose families were fairly well-off, able to support them gathering daily to "drink old pa tea."

And this elder who'd offered the cigarette was called Old Chen. Old Chen's family had originally been small landlords in the village—fifty or sixty *mu*, relying on having three sons and lots of labor. Counted as "leading household." But back then they'd also been tormented by officials and bandits. After the Australians came, they'd prospered by being "model households" for the Heavenly Land Society. Those in the village who resented his family said the Chens were "always first to eat whatever's hot."

Of course, what he'd eaten wasn't "shit" but the "dividend" of being first to dare. Because they produced more grain and earned more money, the Chen family had flourished these past few years. First, through the model household connection, he became village head. Then his somewhat literate second son got a C-grade diploma and, through the Heavenly Land Society's recommendation, entered the Maniao Agricultural Training Center. After graduating, he became a manager at Nanbao Farm.

Now Old Chen was quite puffed up. With his son a "cadre," he was practically a "titled elder." Though he was no longer village head, besides the resident policeman, nearly every village cadre deferred to him and consulted him on matters big and small.

"White Holy Ship, eh? Shuangxi, you've really moved up in the world." The lead elder said with a smile, pulling out a box of matches from his pocket, lighting up and taking a deep drag, as if savoring the "taste of money" embodied in this "luxury product."

"What moving up?" Tan Shuangxi laughed. "Been out fighting for years. Come back and my farming skills have gotten rusty."

"Farm work, that's nothing to be proud of." Old Chen said. "Break your back for a year, can't match three months of working in the city! Folks in the village are all thinking about transferring their land and going to the city for work. Like you—a few years soldiering and you've set up such a family estate. If you'd relied on your parents and brother working the land, several generations couldn't have earned this much."

"It's all thanks to the Senate." Tan Shuangxi said. "Without the Senate, we'd still be scraping the dirt and hauling salt water!"

"They used to say good iron doesn't make nails, good men don't make soldiers. But once the Australians came, soldiering became a good job!" another old man said.

"Joining the Ming army, you couldn't even get a complete uniform." Old Chen sighed. "The military men in the local garrison were dressed like beggars. Couldn't even eat enough. That kind of soldiering really was pointless. Not like now—they leave as mud monkeys and come back polished into proper people!" He looked at Tan Shuangxi with envy and resentment in his eyes.

Tan Shuangxi had seen such looks plenty. This village wasn't like other villages composed of migrants from various places. Most were old families who knew each other's roots. Envying those who had and mocking those who didn't was the norm. In a sense, Tan Shuangxi's existence had greatly affected Old Chen's prestige in the village.

But Old Chen absolutely didn't dare defy "Senate authority," and Tan Shuangxi was the physical manifestation of that authority in the village. Tan Shuangxi wasn't an ordinary soldier—he'd come back with platoon leader duties. According to the local policeman, he'd soon become an officer.

So alongside his envy and jealousy, he had to somewhat ingratiate himself. To show concern, he asked: "Shuangxi! You're twenty-five now, right? Not young anymore. Hasn't your family arranged a match for you? Even your younger brother is almost set!"

"They've been trying, but I need military approval to marry now." Tan Shuangxi deflected. "Besides, just a few days of leave—not enough time for matchmaking and dating..."

"Dating and all that, that's new stuff." A woman doing chores nearby said. "When my dad found me a family, we didn't even meet. Not three days later I was married! Until the veil was lifted, I didn't even know if my groom was long-faced or short-faced!"

"It was supposed to be parents' orders and matchmaker's words." The village's old scholar laughed. "This matchmaking and dating is new fashion the directors brought. Though it's changing customs, it's actually a good thing. If the marriage turns out badly later, they can't blame parents or matchmaker."

"If unhappy, nowadays you can divorce. Just go to the town office together and you're divorced." Someone said. "Caiwang's wife—married less than a year and already making a fuss about divorce. Her family came to counsel but no use!"

"Caiwang is usually so honest and proper. Never did anything shady. His family conditions aren't bad either..." Tan Shuangxi was puzzled.

Caiwang was one of the few childhood friends still remaining in the village. On this visit, he'd only heard from his parents that Caiwang was still farming in the village, unmarried. He hadn't expected there was such a story!
