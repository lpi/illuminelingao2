# Chapter 2791: New Equipment (Part 2)

"Very suitable, very easy to use, guys who like the new and loathe the old! How many years has the Hall rifle only been used?" Comrade Thorpe said.

Although there was ridicule from the Joint Logistics about the Navy liking the new and loathing the old, the Navy was very supportive of equipping the Type 1637. This was natural; the spare ammunition distribution for sailors' rifles was negligible compared to the massive warships, and sailors rarely used rifles, so ammunition consumption could be ignored. As for the Base Force and Marines, the former was stationed for defense with warehouses right behind them; the latter basically operated near coastlines and rivers, rarely going deep into places where ships could not supply. Moreover, their establishment number was small, self-sustained combat time was short, mostly small unit actions like raids, having certain requirements for rifle rate of fire and range.

The General Staff Political Department also submitted a report. The General Political Department pointed out in the report: Troops using new rifles have more complex tactics, which places higher requirements on the cultural level of officers. Only with a higher cultural level can they understand well and apply these new tactics well.

The intellectual talents cultivated by the Senate's own education system were completely insufficient. Various departments were also not willing to substantiate them into the army. The Political Department expressed that the quality of officers urgently needed to be improved.

So two opinions formed within the army. The industrial department was also very contradictory. On one hand, Senators of the industrial sector held extremely strong interest in product upgrades. After all, the performance of the Hall rifle after being put into production couldn't be considered "perfectly satisfactory." If Type 1637 could be launched, it meant the industrial department would welcome industrial upgrading. Especially the fixed ammunition to be used by Type 1637 would force upgrades in metal stamping and chemical industry.

On the other hand, producing Type 1637 posed new challenges to the current mechanical processing level. The structure of the Minié rifle was simple to the extreme; strictly speaking, the core component was just a barrel, and the most complex part was its trigger part. Extremely few parts, simple processing. The caliber of more than ten millimeters also made it insensitive to tolerance—the same for ammunition.

Although the Hall rifle had some improvements, what was added was just a movable breechblock, not counting as too big an improvement.

But Type 1637 was completely a modern breech-loading rifle. More complex structure, more parts, smaller tolerance, and higher quality materials. With the current machining and material level of the industrial sector, stable mass production was very difficult.

Since this was a brand-new rifle, actual equipment and tooling couldn't be universal with the old rifle production line. A new factory needed to be built, and at the same time, ammunition production enterprises needed to be built as support. Even if the supply of raw materials and skilled workers could be guaranteed without hindrance, stable mass production would probably take three or four years.

"Producing while constructing is not impossible, but the main problems are two: one is quality not quite stable, two is output very low." Zhan Wuya expressed his opinion to Wu De who came to consult after reading the entire structure of the rifle.

"How much can be produced in the first year?"

"Under the premise of incomplete equipment and tooling, relying on skilled fitters to hand-file and assemble, the first year can probably produce about three to five hundred qualified products. After equipment and tooling support is completed, mass production will be fast; an annual output of ten thousand won't be a problem—provided you can guarantee the investment. Oh right, there is also ammunition; this requires chemical industry support. Black powder propellant can be used, but it's best to use smokeless powder. Also, we haven't done the deep drawing process for brass cartridge cases—but this isn't too difficult. Right, can copper supply be guaranteed?"

"Japanese copper..."

"To tell the truth, that little output of Japanese copper is really not enough to look at. Not just bullets, just for current industrial needs, Japanese copper is already stretched to the limit. New sources must be opened as soon as possible."

"Looking at it this way, it's really not easy."

"Actually everyone knows there are benefits to this matter, but doing it faces heavy difficulties." Zhan Wuya laughed, "Those artillery guys in the Army shout every day about throwing Napoleon cannons into the garbage heap of history, but up to now they still have to rely on those 'iron tubes' to maintain firepower. Who doesn't like good stuff, but it's expensive! The Trial 32 Battalion Gun has been tested from 1632 until now; the few equipped to the Marines are almost scrapped, yet still not mass-produced. Is it because the Army doesn't want to?"

Of course, it wasn't that the Army didn't want to, but the Ministry of Finance and the Planning Academy felt it unnecessary. Wu De understood his meaning. regarding artillery equipment, it was always that the Navy's artillery technology was more advanced than the Army's. Being technically inferior was one thing, but the Navy happened to need particularly many cannons configured on ships and fortresses. Crowding out a large amount of funds and industrial resources, making the Army complain endlessly.

"Let's not mention this matter. If Type 37 rifle is to be mass-produced, do you think it is feasible?"

"Of course feasible." Zhan Wuya nodded, "Still the same sentence, as long as you can guarantee investment, I can do it here."

So the consultation opinion paper returned to the desk of the General Staff. Rifles were of no use to the Navy, so they didn't care about the dominance of this matter. Then the attitude of the largest potential user determined the future of the weapon.

Although the opinion of the General Staff was not to re-equip, Senator officers had their own thoughts; "re-equip" and "not re-equip" each had supporters. In the conference room of the General Staff, Senator officers of the Army erupted in intense debate. This debate lasted for two or three days. Both sides set out sand tables, maps, and videos filmed at the frontline respectively, conducting repeated argumentation. For this reason, Marine Corps Commander Shi Zhiqi, who was in the first batch issued Type 37 rifles for trial use, was also called to "testify."

Senator Shi was a loyal enthusiast of the 1637 rifle. In the "trial use," every combat example was recorded. The conclusion was the biggest drawback of this gun was not equipping the troops earlier.

Of course, during the period, the issue of whether infantry needed to equip breastplates was dragged in, and a burst of off-topic debate with Senate characteristics erupted again.

The consultation opinion paper finally landed after traveling around the Senate. The final conclusion was Senate-style mud-mixing (compromise). Secretary of State Ma made a concluding speech at the State Council meeting. Believing that the Type 1637 rifle "is advanced, is progressive, represents the new military trend," however "large-scale mass production of this gun takes time." Since the gun had been finalized, putting it into mass production for re-equipment was also completely necessary.

So the meeting decided to build a new rifle factory in Danzhou Industrial Park. As for the ammunition factory, it would not be started temporarily, but shared with the Minié bullet production factory, gradually transitioning to fixed ammunition production.

Of course, it would take time for the new rifle factory to form production capacity. In order to let the troops familiarize as soon as possible, the 1637 rifle would adopt the form of "small quantity, multiple batches" to equip troops in batches.

The first batch of troops to be equipped was the Lingao Garrison Battalion commanded by the General Guard Bureau of the Senate. The Reconnaissance General Bureau Special Reconnaissance Team would also purchase a small amount; the Marines currently already had about a platoon of "trial products." The meeting decided that this gun would fully equip the First Expeditionary Force of the Marines. Replacing the original Hall rifles.

Among Army troops, the objects of initial equipment were Mountain Companies and Light Infantry Companies. Gradually expanding to Line Infantry. At the same time, Type 1637 would also produce short-barrel models to equip artillery, cavalry, and navy.

This proposal was considered settled. For the opposition, gradual re-equipment naturally wouldn't impact the existing system of the troops; for the proponents, this was considered approving rifle re-equipment from the legal level. Moreover, after determining the ordering units, the rifle orders were also guaranteed—although it was an arsenal, costs and profits had to be calculated too.

Now, the matter of Factory No. 37 landing naturally arrived before Dongmen Chuiyu's eyes. Although this was a matter of the industrial sector, after all, it was an arsenal again, and many things had to be approved by him.

Judging from the content of the incoming document, several Senators involved in the design of the 1637 rifle had arrived in Danzhou, preparing to roll up sleeves and work hard—after all, this was their biological son, had to fully prove its "excellence."

As everyone knew, whether a weapon was good to use or not, design performance was only one aspect; organizing production was the main show. There were countless weapons in this world with seemingly beautiful design indicators that ended up as chicken feathers (a mess) due to production deficiencies. Experience and lessons in this aspect on light weapons were especially numerous.

The rifles currently issued to the Marines and General Guard Bureau for trial use were all carefully manufactured and processed by mechanical sector Senators leading technical backbones, with materials also chosen from thousands. Naturally, they performed excellently. But mass manufacturing, having to rely on fast-track workers with low levels, quality decline was inevitable.

"This Li Yiwo didn't design the 1637, what's he joining the fun for?" Looking again, he discovered that this Joint Logistics Factory 37 was prepared to use "Reconnaissance General Bureau Repair Workshop" as the foundation.

The so-called "Reconnaissance General Bureau Repair Workshop" was actually a small workshop for making guns. Specifically for Li Yiwo to hand-rub various "modern" light weapons to satisfy certain Senators' obsession with certain light weapons. For example, Senate versions of "Hualong Made" (handmade copy) Tokarev TT33, Browning, and Luger, which quite a few Senators had one of, came from this repair workshop.

"So that's it!" Dongmen Chuiyu thought, no wonder they wanted to pull Li Yiwo into the partnership.

One of the reasons was naturally because he himself had good craftsmanship, was a quite excellent fitter, familiar with structures of various light weapons, and experienced. The second was that this repair workshop accepted various firearm equipment shipped from the North American Sub-helm in the past. Although in the old space-time these equipment could only count as things for amateur play, in this space-time they were high-grade, precision, and advanced. The equipment manufactured in this space-time equipped by this repair workshop was also the newest and best. Moreover, this repair workshop had long done weapon maintenance, repair, and refurbishment work for the Special Reconnaissance Team, cultivating dozens of technical workers with rich experience in modern weapon repair. This was rare wealth for a new factory.

"Smart enough!" He couldn't help smiling, thinking since they had this heart, let's see how big a miracle they could produce. Anyway, now it was a headache for Wu De.

Dongmen Chuiyu pondered for a moment, and wrote at the end of the incoming letter: "The General Staff has no other opinions on land, equipment, and personnel allocation work required by Joint Logistics Factory 37. Everything shall be subject to the Planning Academy's plan."
