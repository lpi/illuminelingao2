# Chapter 2832 Reporter Mai Ruibao

The restructuring target was the Lingao County Opera Society. Compared to the puppet troupe, most of the opera society's folk art performances had low costs—just one or two performers, not much costume or prop expense—suitable for individual solo operations.

"Since they think they earn too little in the troupe, let them go solo." Dingding expressed support. "A forced melon isn't sweet."

"Going solo is fine, but I didn't pass on these skills for free..." Wang Tao said.

In this timeline's storytelling and folk arts world, Wang Tao was practically at the "founding master" level. Not that his professional technique was particularly high—this timeline had plenty of skilled professional "stars" who were definitely much better than Wang Tao the amateur enthusiast. But when it came to mastering the most scripts, no one in the world could compare.

First, as an enthusiast, he'd collected massive classic scripts when traversing, including scripts and performance recordings from all national schools of storytelling. Second, there were various related materials brought by the Grand Library and other Senators, especially the vast ocean of web novels, many of which had been adapted into storytelling versions.

With so many materials in hand, apprentices with only B-level diplomas could only kowtow in reverence. So Wang Tao's proposal was that performers wanting to go independent would need to pay "usage fees" based on the scripts they'd learned—one script, one fee.

"Fees paid annually, linked to annual performer license registration." Wang Tao proposed. "The money collected counts as our department's operating funds."

"How much should fees be? I think collecting based on percentage of their revenue would be reasonable..."

"True, but how could we possibly know their specific income?" Wang Tao smiled. "We can only roughly use the fixed-tax method—collect an annual fee. Get some income. If they go out and business booms, collect a bit more; if business is slow, collect a bit less. How exactly to collect, I'll think about it more."

This proposal was now on his desk. Though Dingding hadn't had time to read it carefully, a rough look showed Wang Tao had put in considerable thought. And his calculations were the same as his own: try not to maintain professional troupes as much as possible.

Though this only involved folk art performers for now, when the time was ripe later, it could be extended to prepare for "privatization."

Wang Tao was currently the Performance Division chief, and his thinking aligned with Dingding's. Many things would be easier to handle. As for Fang Fei, he was enthusiastic about organizing various group calisthenics, large-scale performance programs, creating "ritual feel." He actually had no ideas about the performance market.

Dingding first flipped through the relevant proofs on his desk. Proofreading work no longer required him now—more about deliberating over wording. Sometimes such deliberation took considerable time, but today he just skimmed through. He picked up the report on *Liangyou* pictorial magazine's inaugural matters.

*Liangyou* was a 16-panel photography pictorial that Propaganda was preparing to publish. Unlike the lithograph and copperplate pictorials they'd published earlier, *Liangyou*'s material would mainly come from news photography. This benefited from progress in the Chemical and Optical departments over the years, industrializing photography and image printing.

Though Dingding didn't know how much effort the industrial departments had put in behind the scenes, he knew what enormous benefits imaging could bring to newspapers and magazines. Especially news photography pictorials—in an era without television, illustrated pictorials had far greater influence than newspapers.

For *Liangyou*'s launch, besides establishing a new printing facility, a special news photography training course had been held to train photojournalists.

The *Liangyou* masthead was planned to be written by Wen Desi or Wang Luobin. After brief consideration, Dingding added a note: "This matter should have a Senator proficient in calligraphy do the writing. It's not advisable..." He thought a moment, then crossed out "not advisable."

The pictorial was planned at 32 pages in 16-panel format. Besides 26 pages of photography, there'd be 6 pages of lithograph comics. All layouts would use mixed text-and-image format.

Dingding picked up the pictorial printing proofs that had been delivered and examined the image printing quality. For pictorials to better showcase image effects, even black-and-white printing had certain requirements for paper, ink, and printing presses. In early years, the Senate's printing factory could only manage lithograph technology for image printing. Now being able to print photography pictorials was a major step up.

On this late spring morning of 1638, *Liangyou* pictorial's trainee photojournalist Mai Ruibao was experiencing an indescribable mental daze. Though his behind was still bouncing on the first-class carriage's sofa seat on the urban rail, his body seemed to have magically floated into mid-air. A month ago, when he officially joined the pictorial, Director Dingding had personally handed him the brand-new "Lingao Optics" camera, instructing him on interview and photography essentials. Mai Ruibao had felt a wave of happiness rush to his head, intensely moved.

But that couldn't compare to this time. What had he done to deserve this? A greenhorn just out of school, having just studied at Fangcaodi for a few years then been selected for the art intensive training class to study painting for two years. Because he'd shown intense interest in the Senators' magical treasure—the camera—he'd become a member of the first photojournalist training class. After several months of study, he'd officially entered *Liangyou* pictorial. His first assignment, and he could actually sit in the Senator-exclusive carriage, accompanying a group of Directors—not to mention the Director of Directors, the beloved Chairman Wang Luobin, on an inspection and interview of the Danzhou Industrial Zone. He wouldn't even dare dream this.

Most unexpected was how approachable Chairman Wang was, without a hint of "big director" airs. Throughout the journey, he chatted and laughed with various naturalized-citizen staff—especially getting along well with the female reporter Sun Shangxiang from *Lingao Times*. Miss Sun was so quick-witted; whatever direction the topic turned, she could respond cleverly. The carriage constantly echoed with Chairman Wang's hearty laughter and Reporter Sun's lark-like delicate giggling. And her dark blue dress with white lapels only accentuated her fair skin and graceful figure all the more. Mai Ruibao gazed at Miss Sun as if he himself were the one carrying on that easy conversation with her, his heart overflowing with happiness and joy. When they reached the station, he was reluctant to get off—oh wait, this urban rail train had really arrived at Danzhou already? How was it so fast?

Coming to his senses, Mai Ruibao rushed ahead of the Directors and leaped off the carriage. The recently built Danzhou Yangpu Station mainly handled freight, so besides railway staff, the platform was practically empty. Yet at this moment, under the simple rain shelter, two columns of Japanese National Army soldiers had already formed up. As soon as the carriage door opened, a "fake Short-Hair" jumped out. Just stepping onto the platform, he raised the wooden box hanging from his chest, flipped open the front cover, and out popped a leather-wrapped pig-snout-like thing. He pulled and extended it, aiming left for a moment then turning right, fiddling with various mechanisms on the box making clicking sounds. To the simple, alert mercenaries, this sequence of movements was indistinguishable from loading and aiming some mysterious firearm. Two nearby Japanese soldiers immediately raised their bayoneted rifles and approached. Fortunately, at that moment, Senator Lü Zeyang walked over from the other end of the platform and stopped the Japanese mercenaries, having them reform their ranks.

Mai Ruibao was completely unaware of the danger of nearly having several extra holes in his body. He looked around at the platform environment and the diffracted light under the rain shelter, silently reciting the Sunny 16 rule he'd memorized countless times, adjusted the aperture, attached the cable release, then moved back to the viewfinder—focus looked good. Director Lü's head-to-toe inverted image projected perfectly onto the ground glass screen. Then he heard Chairman Wang's resonant voice: "Commander Zeyang—" The inverted images on the ground glass went from one to two. He quickly removed the viewfinder, inserted the dark slide containing the dry plate negative, took a deep breath to steady the camera, and at the moment Chairman Wang and Director Lü's hands clasped, pressed the cable release.

Operating a glass plate camera was complicated. The procedures and mnemonics the Senator instructor had taught cycled constantly in Mai Ruibao's mind. His hands never stopped, consecutively capturing several Directors' heroic poses. Finally, his lens seemed to automatically seek its target and aimed at Sun Shangxiang, who was interviewing Director Lü. Unfortunately, Director Lü seemed distracted, hurriedly saying a few words before ending the interview. By the time Mai Ruibao inserted the dark slide again, through the side viewfinder, he regretfully saw Miss Sun leaving him only a retreating silhouette.

The Senators and their entourage naturally had carriages to take them. Mai Ruibao had originally been "hitching a ride" on the exclusive train carriage. Naturally, he couldn't hitch a carriage ride too—after all, he wasn't as cute and charming as Sun Shangxiang.

Outside the station was a simple marketplace. Buildings and shops were all simple, but commerce here looked quite prosperous. First, there were many taverns and eateries. Second, the station plaza had thirty to forty Zero-model rickshaws queued up waiting for fares.

From Mai Ruibao's experience, commerce around large factory districts was usually prosperous. Workers earned high wages and were generally willing to spend. Though the district was newly built, one could imagine it would become increasingly prosperous with the dual boost of station and factory district.

He hailed a Zero-model rickshaw and traveled along a recently paved road for fifteen minutes, arriving at the newly built Danzhou United Chemical's "Specialty Chemical Zone."

The Specialty Chemical Zone was the highest-security industrial zone. Even before entering, he saw the "regulations board" at the factory gate—red background with white text, several dozen rules in all. Before Mai Ruibao could read them carefully, he was drawn to two huge slogans nearby: "Go to work happy, come home safe" and "Safety is the guarantee of family happiness; accidents are the root of life's tragedies."

At the security room by the factory entrance, he showed his ID and *Liangyou* pictorial's letter of introduction, received relevant safety education and security inspection, before finally being allowed to hang a "Press Pass" around his neck and enter the factory grounds.
