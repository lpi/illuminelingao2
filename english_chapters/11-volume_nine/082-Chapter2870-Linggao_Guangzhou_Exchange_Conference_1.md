# Chapter 2870: Lingao-Guangzhou Exchange Conference (1)

Xia Zhongde returned to his lodging and thought through the causes and consequences several times in detail. He then took down from the bookshelf the *Senate Imperially Designated Legal Series*—specifically, *Compilation of Laws Applicable to Criminal Cases*, *Compilation of Arbitration Tribunal Judicial Interpretations on Various Historical Issues in Criminal Cases*, and *Compilation of Arbitration Tribunal Judicial Interpretations and Guidance on Cases Involving the Ming*—and read through the bookmarked sections repeatedly.

After several readings, he felt he had gained a bit more confidence. It seemed the "expert's" guidance wasn't false. However, he still had one concern: laws were laws; the key was still the people implementing them. He had dealt with government offices for nearly twenty years in the Great Ming and knew well that the King of Hell was easy to see but the little demons were hard to deal with. Whether legal provisions could be implemented in practice still depended on the specific case handlers.

This time, processing the bail was surprisingly smooth. Originally, he had wondered whether to "grease palms" beforehand—he had experienced the Australians' reputation for integrity, but this was after all a case involving human life. To be cautious, he had specifically asked the "expert," but the other party had looked at him with disdain and simply told him to "just go handle it."

Xia Zhongde didn't know whether the other party had already said hello or whether the Australians really "handled things according to law." His heart was somewhat unsettled.

After much thought, his only option was to go find this connection again for a talk. Thinking of this, he gathered his spirits and began writing an invitation card.

News of the Qu family's bail quickly appeared as a "development" in the *Weekly Developments* of the Lingao Police Bureau. Although the procedures were legal, bailing out persons involved in major criminal cases under investigation was still a first. Lai Youwei was afraid the document he received couldn't bear this responsibility, so he reported to his direct superior. Unexpectedly, the team leader also felt this matter was somewhat difficult, so he simply reported it as a "development"—after all, the current official director of the Lingao Special Municipality Police Bureau was still Ran Yao himself.

Ran Yao naturally saw the development. He was now overwhelmed with daily affairs and rarely inquired about cases anymore. Only cases that belonged to difficult problems would involve him. A murder case with clear context and complete witness and physical evidence, already so transparent, appearing in the developments—he saw the Criminal Division's intention at once.

Although he wasn't as familiar with legal provisions as the Senators in the legal sector, based on general legal principles, whether Madam Qu committed murder belonged to a "separate case" unrelated to this case.

Since bail had been granted, there was no need to complicate matters. Arresting Madam Qu in this case was itself suspected of being illegal. Detectives born as naturalized citizens, no matter how much modern police theory and law they received, always unconsciously applied some old notions to case handling. This was inevitable; he generally didn't demand too much.

Qingruo walked along the corridor carrying a tray. The light green dress tailored to fit her figure, paired with a vest adorned with glazed colored threads, set off her dark hair even more beautifully. Anyone who saw her would praise: What a beautiful young lady!

Qingruo walked gracefully, but her eyes occasionally stole glances at the courtyard below.

This inner courtyard had a pond with rocks piled along the banks and bonsai mountains. Several dozen koi were kept in the pond, multicolored, swimming in the clear blue water as if floating in air. Such an exquisite scene—even Qingruo, who came from a city like Hangzhou, had never witnessed it before. The fish were the rarest "Australian Koi," the most precious kind. A single mature fish of middling quality would sell for fifty taels of silver in Hangzhou. Qingruo herself hadn't sold for fifty taels.

In the waterside pavilion by the pond, people were banqueting. The faint sounds of string and bamboo instruments drifted over, mixed with a woman's low singing—Kunqu opera.

She knew the waterside pavilion likely had a Senator in it, because this Kunqu tune was rarely appreciated locally in Lingao. On the contrary, some Senators who liked to affect cultural refinement enjoyed it.

Senators rarely came here. No more than a dozen Senators came regularly. After all, Heyuan Street was the red-light district, and coming to Ziming Tower still carried some scruples.

Qingruo wasn't like some of her sisters, eagerly hoping to catch a Senator's favor and devising ways to serve by a Senator's side. She wasn't that greedy and didn't want to eat the bowl of rice that was "serving through beauty" anymore.

Qingruo was originally a girl from a musician household in Guangzhou—in other words, she was born destined to eat the bowl of rice of "entertainers and courtesans." Trained by her mother from childhood in playing, singing, and performing, at fifteen, her mother made the match for a wealthy merchant to "comb" her.

This transaction was of course excellent income for her family, but for the young girl, it was hardly a good match. However, being born in an entertainer household, she had no choice. After a few years, as favor waned and the merchant no longer visited, she could only sell smiles in a pleasure house. After drifting along for nearly ten years, seeing her looks gradually fade and gifts diminish, neither the madam of the pleasure house nor her own parents had kind words for her anymore.

What happened to courtesans whose "business" declined, Qingruo, from an entertainer household, knew only too well. Although she technically "worked independently," only "renting a room" in the pleasure house, her own birth parents weren't necessarily more kind-hearted than the madam. If she couldn't stay in a high-class pleasure house, they would naturally send her to a low-class brothel to "make money."

Fortunately, heaven took pity. With one cannon shot, the Australians entered Guangzhou. The pleasure houses were closed, and Qingruo regained her freedom. But although her body was free, she had nowhere to go. Her parents were like tigers and wolves, not people to rely on. As for marriage, having been deep in the pleasure houses, her reputation was ruined. She couldn't marry into any decent family. Yet she wasn't willing to "lower herself" and marry an ordinary commoner. Just as she was hesitating, she heard that Ziming Tower was recruiting "female attendants." It was clearly stated that whether to take a yellow ticket and do business was entirely up to her. She thought that although she didn't intend to do business anymore, she was familiar with the trade, so she joined.

Upon entering Ziming Tower, she realized pleasure houses could operate like this! Ziming Tower was not only luxurious and dazzling, but the assignment and arrangement of the girls also followed a different set of rules: based on different businesses, the house was divided into two groups—the Bathing Group and the Dining Group. Within each group, based on differences in work nature, there were further different specialties, each with different pay. What Qingruo did was called "attendant." The work was serving tea and water, arranging dishes, welcoming guests and seeing them off, and guiding them—in a pleasure house, this would be the role of maids and amahs. But in Ziming Tower, it was called "service staff."

To be service staff, the most critical thing was quick eyes and hands, understanding human feelings and reading expressions. Qingruo came from a musician household and had been an "old name" herself. Over a dozen years of cultivated skills in reading people's expressions and catering to their desires, plus her good looks, quickly got her promoted to "deputy head," in charge of serving food and wine in several private rooms. Before long, she was selected as a "business backbone" and transferred to Ziming Tower in Lingao.

Ziming Tower's main house was in Guangzhou; Lingao was just a branch. However, due to its location, this branch was very important in the Ziming Tower system. Therefore, those selected to go to the Lingao branch were all "backbones" with development potential in terms of business.

Besides being outstanding at her job, Qingruo was transferred largely because of her language abilities. Girls from musician households did business in welcoming and seeing off, interacting daily with people from various places. She could not only speak Mandarin but also the major dialects of the province. She could even manage Hokkien. With such a foundation, after arriving at Ziming Tower, she picked up "New Speech" very quickly.

Lingao was now a commercial city, bustling with merchants and travelers. People responsible for reception and service naturally had to be able to use various languages.

Unexpectedly, not long after she arrived at Lingao Ziming Tower, she encountered a "big assignment."

This big assignment was that Ziming Tower had undertaken the reception work for the "First Lingao-Guangzhou Progressive Gentry Experience Exchange Conference." Since entering Guangzhou without bloodshed, how to further unite the gentry of Guangzhou's urban and rural areas and put them to use, reducing the resistance to reform and assimilation, had always been an important matter of concern to Lingao. To win the gentry's hearts, mere intimidation wouldn't work—the esteemed District Chief Wen had pointed out: "If we only use whips and bayonets to suppress them, we will inevitably push them to the opposing side. Once circumstances change, they will be the most dangerous enemies at our bedside." The truly fundamental approach should be to make the gentry realize how enormous the benefits of submitting to the Great Song, this powerful ruler, would bring them, making them genuinely support the Great Song from the bottom of their hearts. To achieve this goal, the most effective means was to have those who had already benefited from the Great Song speak from personal experience. Against this background, the convening of the "First Lingao-Guangzhou Progressive Gentry Experience Exchange Conference" was only natural.

The main purpose of the conference was to let the gentry of Lingao and Guangzhou meet and communicate. To boost their confidence in the Senate on both sides. As Xiong Buyou said: "Don't they really envy Lingao for making big money? Then let's proactively send them to see!"

So Xiong Buyou organized a "Guangzhou Gentry Visiting Delegation," selecting more than twenty each of "gentry actively striving for progress" and "progressive gentry" from Guangzhou, packaging them together and sending them to Lingao for a "visit and study."

The Lingao side attached great importance to this exchange conference. After two days of intensive meetings, exchanges, and tours, a grand banquet was arranged that evening at Ziming Tower to host the gentry of both Lingao and Guangzhou. This evening banquet had taken much thought from the Lingao people to arrange. There were quite a few high-end venues in Lingao now, but some were too "formal," while others lacked "class"—and this class wasn't just about luxurious decoration; the "Australian content" had to be substantial enough to show the importance placed on the visiting delegation. Additionally, tonight's banquet wasn't an official "reception"; it was more recreational and leisurely in nature. Considering all factors, plus the high reception standards and quality of service staff, Ziming Tower naturally came out ahead.

Originally, the first-floor main hall was undoubtedly the most suitable choice—spacious and bright, convenient for both hosts and guests to communicate. However, the main hall wasn't quite "private" enough. After much discussion, Mayor Qian finally decided to hold the banquet in the second-floor private rooms. The gentry of Lingao and Guangzhou would be seated alternately to facilitate communication and feelings. The hosts would just have to be a bit put out, carrying wine glasses and running around to make the rounds.
