# Chapter 2804 On The Road

"Delicious!" Zhang Youcai couldn't help but praise. "This skill is really good!"

Lingao Rice Noodles were considered a local specialty snack, available practically everywhere on the streets. Canteens in factories, schools, and the army also served them daily. For Zhang Youcai to say "good skill," it naturally had to be extraordinary.

"Sister-in-law Huang made this." The village head carefully held the White Holy Ship cigarette Tan Shuangxi offered, playing with it for a long time before putting it to his lips, lighting it, and taking a deep drag. "Her skill in making noodles is indisputable! Number one in the village. Whenever guests come to the village, we arrange for her to cook."

He watched the two soldiers slurping up the rice noodles and laughed, "Eat slowly, no rush. I'll have Huang's son take you there in a while. It's the busy farming season, so he's definitely at home."

After eating, Tan Shuangxi took out a billing slip and paid the money. This kind of duplicate billing slip was specifically used to pay for official travel expenses and could be used to offset taxes. The village head called over the child who had just delivered the food: "Liuzi! Guide these two comrades to Father Fang's house!"

Hearing he had to go to Father Fang's house, Liuzi clearly flinched. The village head laughingly scolded, "What are you afraid of?! The two officers are going with you; Old Fang won't eat you!"

Hearing this, the child nodded in agreement. He then asked the village head timidly: "Boss! My mom asks when the meal money will be paid? It hasn't been paid for three or four months!"

The village head said nonchalantly, "The summer tax hasn't been collected yet, where would the money come from! She won't be shorted; we'll settle the bill when the summer tax is collected!"

Liuzi dared not speak further and just led the two on the road. The village road was a dirt road but appeared maintained and fairly level. Windbreak forests were planted on both sides of the road. Botang was a mixed village, containing both old local "concentrated villages" and new immigrant settlements, so the style of each *jia* along the way varied: some simple and ancient, others brand new. The pedestrians on the road also spoke with accents from all over.

Walking was boring, so Zhang Youcai teased Liuzi to talk. He asked, "I see you're afraid of that Father Fang. Is he a very difficult person to talk to?"

Liuzi was only about ten years old and said angrily, "More than just difficult to talk to, he speaks with weird hostility. If you are lesser than him, just being mocked by him a few times is enough to make you die of anger!"

"So, his popularity isn't very good then."

"Depends on if you have money or not. If you have money, it's good; if not, it's bad." Liuzi said, "Otherwise, to cadres like the village head, the stationed police, and the Heaven and Earth Society special commissioners, he is also polite. Snob! Pui!"

Tan Shuangxi and Zhang Youcai looked at each other; it seemed this family would be hard to deal with.

"Is his family very rich?"

"He was a rich man before the Chiefs came, and now he's even richer." Liuzi said, "He's just very stingy. Don't anyone think of taking advantage of him."

Hearing the child say this, the two felt even more depressed. Not that they wanted to take advantage of anything, but people who were stingy often had eccentric and stubborn personalities. This errand would likely be entangled and unclear.

After walking for a good while, Liuzi suddenly said, "We've reached his land here."

Walking all the way, the land along the route had been meticulously cultivated with crops growing well. But arriving here, a water channel divided the fields on two sides with obvious differences. The land west of the channel was level with crisscrossing ditches. Not only were the crops growing better, but every nook and cranny was planted with cash crops. It was evident that every inch of land was meticulously utilized.

"This Father Fang is an expert!" Tan Shuangxi came from a farming background and praised sincerely.

"The Heaven and Earth Society taught him all of it." Little Liuzi said with some envy, "Originally, he was just a small landlord!"

"Did your family hire the Heaven and Earth Society?" Zhang Laicai asked casually.

"After my dad died, the family had no money. We couldn't afford people from the Heaven and Earth Society, nor could we afford their good seeds." Liuzi sighed.

Chatting had touched upon someone's sad matters, so Zhang Youcai had to change the topic:

"I see the fields in your village are farmed well!" Tan Shuangxi said sincerely.

"Those who can't farm well don't farm anymore." Liuzi said since the Senate promulgated the "Provisional Regulations on Homesteads," although household land couldn't be bought or sold, the management rights could be transferred for a term. Families with little land or labor gradually contracted their land out to big households to farm. Liuzi's family's land was also contracted out.

"...The big households pay land rent every year. Scraping together enough to eat isn't a problem."

"Not farming, what do you plan to do later?"

"There's plenty to do. I'm not old enough yet, but when I turn twelve, I'll go out to be an apprentice." Liuzi was confident. "My mom's uncle works in the printing and dyeing factory in Nanbao. Last time he wrote asking if I wanted to be an apprentice. Apprentices get a wage of one yuan twenty cents!"

Speaking of "one yuan twenty cents," his eyes shone.

Tan Shuangxi smiled: "How old are you? Why don't you go to school?"

"Eleven. I've finished junior primary school. My grades weren't good for senior primary, and the family couldn't afford it either. So I run errands for the village office to earn two meals."

Zhang Laicai joked, "I think you're quite clever. Why not sign up for the Army Youth School when you turn twelve? It's all at public expense!"

"My mom won't agree." Liuzi shook his head. "My real dad died fighting. My stepdad was crippled in fighting too. Actually, I want to go."

"Your father was a martyr?" Tan Shuangxi was quite surprised. "Which battalion?"

"Not any battalion. I heard my stepdad say: they were all old security corps. They fought a battle with pirates at Bopu; many died or were crippled. Those soldiers who didn't die or get crippled back then are at least company commanders now." Saying this, he sighed helplessly.

"You are a survivor; senior primary school should be free."

"Tuition is waived, but living expenses aren't. My dad is missing an arm and can't do heavy work. I have younger brothers and sisters; two dads' pensions alone can't support a big family."

"Even so, the village head still owes you money?" Tan Shuangxi got a bit angry.

"Although delayed, it will always be paid. After all, cooking for the public still earns a few coins." Liuzi said rather helplessly.

"Actually, your mom's skill is good. Since you aren't farming in the village, why not set up a stall or open a small shop in a nearby town? It's much better than suffering in the village."

Liuzi said, "They've thought about it, but they're hesitant and haven't made up their minds yet. After all, opening a shop requires capital, and they don't know if it will succeed. The errand in the village allows us to scrape by..."

Just as they were talking, they suddenly heard someone hailing from afar: "Liuzi—"

The group looked carefully and saw three or four people driving oxen working in the fields. The leader was greeting Liuzi.

Liuzi also took off the torn straw hat on his head and waved at the other person.

"This is..."

"It's the head laborer of Father Fang's family. Named Chen Linhuang, also a Fulao."

While speaking, Chen Linhuang had arrived on the road. He was a sturdy young man, skin tanned dark, wearing only a thin linen undershirt soaked with sweat. His bare forearms revealed solid muscles.

What a fine lad, not only sturdy but also light and agile in movement; good material for light infantry. Tan Shuangxi thought involuntarily.

Before he could speak, Liuzi introduced them: "These two officers came from the troops to find Father Fang."

Chen Linhuang was originally smiling, but his expression instantly became serious hearing this sentence. He looked the two up and down and asked softly, "Is it about Hu Weide?"

Tan Shuangxi knew the comer was likely an acquaintance of Hu Weide and nodded, "It is."

"He..." Chen Linhuang's face grew even heavier, "Is gone?!"

Tan Shuangxi nodded heavily: "Yes. We are here to notify his family."

"That fool!" Chen Linhuang was disappointed and indignant.

"How..."

Chen Linhuang didn't take up his words but said to Liuzi, "Why don't you go back? I'll take the two officers to find the old man."

"Good, good, good." Liuzi didn't want to see Old Man Fang anyway, so he was more than happy to have someone take over.

Chen Linhuang sent Liuzi away, exchanged a few words with the laborers in the field, and then led the way in front.

"Father Fang isn't at home right now; he's directing laborers at the West Estate today. I'll send someone to deliver a message right away." After Chen Linhuang finished speaking, he called a person over and instructed him with a few words. That person ran off quickly.

The group headed towards the Fang family home. On the way, Zhang Youcai couldn't help asking, "Since the Fang family has a West Estate, surely there's an East Estate?"

" The Fang family residence is at the East Estate. The West Estate is just a smooth threshing ground with a few laborers living there, used for keeping livestock and piling things."

"Having two estates, he must have a lot of land?" Tan Shuangxi clicked his tongue secretly; he hadn't expected Hu Weide's father-in-law to be a big household!

"Probably seven or eight hundred *mu*. Half is his own, half is rented from villagers." Chen Linhuang wiped the sweat from his forehead with a towel. "Originally his family didn't even have a hundred *mu*. It all relied on the big backer of the Heaven and Earth Society. Between opening wasteland and renting land, he's now a demonstration household."

"Hu Weide was originally a long-term laborer for Father Fang too, right?"

"Yes, originally he lived in the same room as us. Ah Wei was literate and smart, and he did things methodically. Everyone said he was wasted being a long-term laborer on the estate—" Chen Linhuang smiled bitterly, "Accursed tongue!"

Tan Shuangxi had a strange sense of unfamiliarity while chatting. The Hu Weide described by the head laborer didn't seem to be the same person as the Hu Weide he knew. Compared to the volunteer soldier Hu Weide he knew—flighty, boastful, talking big all day, unable to perform basic training well—the laborer Hu Weide was enthusiastic, capable, and popular. It made sense; otherwise, why would the Fang girl fall for him? If recruiting a live-in husband, given the Fang family's assets, her range of choices would have been huge.

In short, this man who was sneered at in the platoon and company probably really had many shining points, just that he wasn't suited for the army.

"How is his wife?" Zhang Laicai asked suddenly. Perhaps feeling his words weren't quite appropriate, he hurriedly added, "I mean, is their relationship good?"

"Good." Chen Linhuang was a bit sentimental. "Newlyweds, how could the relationship not be good."

Tan Shuangxi glared at Zhang Laicai, feeling his gossipmongering was a bit too exuberant.
