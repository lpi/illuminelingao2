# Chapter 2796: The Meeting

"Zishan, you are a rare guest here." Ma Qianzhu smiled and moved his gaze away from the document in front of him.

As soon as the words fell, a charming female secretary brought tea.

Originally, Secretary of State Ma never used female staff around him, all male naturalized citizens.

Starting from two years ago, female staff around him increased, inevitably causing discussion among many Senators. Some said he was "blending in with the mundane world (compromising principles)," others said he was avoiding suspicion of "gender discrimination." In short, those few "Big Secretaries" wearing dark cotton tunic suits with collars buttoned neatly were gone.

Xiao Zishan bowed with a face full of smiles and said thanks. Picked up the tea cup to symbolically sniff the fragrance, "Good tea." Seeing the female secretary had retreated out, he continued to say:

"Secretary of State Ma, the welcome ceremony plan forwarded a few days ago..."

"I have already approved this matter, nothing special. Spend a few more money, make the ceremony a bit grander. The army fought for two years; honor for soldiers must be given sufficiently in this aspect."

"In the welcome ceremony plan, there is still one presiding activity leader not determined. Our preparatory group discussed and decided to invite a Big Leader to come to show importance." The Big Leader Xiao Zishan referred to meant the Chairman of the Senate, Speaker, Secretary of State, and the twelve main Senators responsible for specific affairs under them. Although Xiao Zishan also counted as one of them, in formal occasions, he never placed himself in this sequence.

Ma Qianzhu naturally understood the meaning in his words, nothing more than wanting him to take this limelight. He was long accustomed to taking limelight; it had no special meaning. If not for maintaining a certain "exposure rate," he really wasn't willing to consume precious time in ceremonial occasions.

"Invite Chairman Wang to preside over this matter. He blew the horn for the expedition; now returning in triumph, it is most appropriate for him to welcome. The first act of our mainland strategy also draws a period here."

Ma Qianzhu said quite emotionally.

Xiao Zishan deliberately replied appearing very difficult, "Chairman Wang has no free time recently. He agreed to Senator Lin, that is Lin Hanlong's request, went to Gaoshan Ridge together to do optical experiments. Planned to take another week to return."

"Lin Hanlong? Optical experiments?" Ma Qianzhu didn't connect these two people for a moment, countless doubts popping up in his heart.

"Chairman Wang is an optical major. Although he didn't work in his own profession later, after all, he is professionally trained. Regarding the two-meter rangefinder, Senator Lin's help-seeking post on BBS was seen by Chairman Wang. I feel for a welcome ceremony, there is no need to let Chairman Wang interrupt scientific research. Just let a main leader come is fine." Xiao Zishan hurriedly explained, especially biting the word "main" very heavily. This rhetoric had to have rationality, and also highlight someone's importance; it was the result of his thinking for half a day.

Sure enough, this result was very effective. Ma Qianzhu immediately acknowledged Chairman Wang's identity as a scientific and technological worker, speaking in his consistent amiable accent, "Then I'll make a trip on behalf of Chairman Wang."

Xiao Zishan inevitably felt proud in his heart, "Then I'll handle it accordingly. Will send the detailed itinerary later."

Major matter decided, Xiao Zishan drank a few more mouthfuls of tea, chatted about some irrelevancies, ready to stand up, pat butt and leave.

Ma Qianzhu threw out a topic: "Have you read the latest issue of *Morning Star*?"

Xiao Zishan naturally had read it. Every issue of *Morning Star* before printing would send a proof copy to the General Office. Besides Editor-in-Chief Ding Ding, he was the person who saw it earliest.

"Read it, read it. You mean the matter of Great Ming intending to negotiate peace recently?"

"Correct, what do you think?"

"I relatively agree with Comrade Jiang Shan's view. Great Ming wants peace, just still have to fight a battle." Xiao Zishan said, "If it can succeed, it is more beneficial to us."

"Striving for a phase of peace is best." Ma Qianzhu frowned tightly, but he didn't say anything more.

The next day, major matters were discussed and decided at the regular State Council meeting of the Central Government Administration Council. When the meeting proceeded to the end, Ma Qianzhu raised the matter of "peace talks" again.

"...Everyone presumably also knows, recently the Ming State is very likely to negotiate peace with us." Seeing a burst of commotion among Senators, he raised his hand to stop the discussion, "Although looking at it now, both sides have the intention of peace talks. However, the war is not over yet. Whether in Guangdong/Guangxi frontline or rear, sporadic battle reports are sent every day. Matters of cadres and soldiers dying in action happen every day.

"Although from the overall strategy, we achieved a complete victory. However, as sages said 'victory always has a price,' the price paid is also huge. Two years of war, the negative impacts brought are appearing. Let alone the deficit in finance, just on the level of social governance, many problems start to be exposed. The General Staff Political Department and the Political Security Bureau Social Conditions Division have detailed reports. Whether troops or populace, there are war-weariness and discontent emotions. Problems also appeared in the discipline of frontline troops. Although belonging to individual cases, over a long period, the spread of this emotion is probably inevitable. Everyone must pay attention to it, put effort to digest."

"Recently frontline troops began to return to stations successively for rest, reorganization, and replenishment. Naturally, after troops return, due honors and rewards will not be missing at all. But the huge difference between frontline and rear, the stimulation brought by comrades' sacrifice, pain left on the battlefield... probably will cause some officers and soldiers to generate emotions. Hope everyone pays attention."

"We discussed this problem with the General Staff. Comrade Dongmen prepares to propose to the General Office, let the Lingao Garrison Battalion also wear Military Police armbands. If not enough, mobilize part of Hainan local National Army troops. ensure main stations and surroundings are equipped with sufficient Military Police. Our police system also made plans." Ran Yao said.

Ma Qianzhu nodded: "Discipline inspection is one aspect. The key point is still to do well in psychological counseling and implementing preferential treatment. Let soldiers feel respected, needed; this is the key."

"Our civil affairs system has specifically issued documents and made plans. But preferential treatment and compensation involve quite a few aspects; best to have a coordinating agency to coordinate together."

...

Serious matters discussed, when everyone started to bullshit. Xiao Zishan proposed a group of retreat tasks like "Welcome Ceremony Host," waiting for everyone to decide quickly so they could go to eat lunch. The canteen had already delivered working meals to each Senator's office. After all, if there were no major matters that had to be said while eating, everyone still tended to leave some private space.

Ma Qianzhu changed his seriousness just now, taking the conversation cheerfully: "All matters that must go to show face. I see let's divide them together, don't pass one by one."

Saying so, he took a stack of meeting materials over and flipped through, reading all meeting names once, showing everyone the thickness of documents very relaxedly, "Quite a lot. We have many taxes and also many meetings now."

"This, our taxes are not many, but few. Great Ming's are too few..." Cheng Dong wanted to speak again.

"We will discuss this problem later." Ma Qianzhu quickly interrupted his speech.

"...Dutch Trade Delegation, this kind of meeting doesn't need to be brought to the meeting to discuss, right? Si Kaide, you guys from the commercial sector receive this; for the Dutch this counts as decent enough. This isn't a state visit. If some Prince William came, inviting Chairman Wang to receive wouldn't be too late."

"Secretary of State Ma, I want to call your attention that those coming are not representatives of the Dutch East India Company—" Si Kaide raised an objection, "The visiting delegation is important bankers and some big merchants of the Seven Provinces. Although among them there is no lack of VOC shareholders, they are not the same thing after all. Still invite Comrade He Ying to attend is better."

Giving you limelight you still don't want! Ma Qianzhu criticized secretly, but still smiled and nodded looking at He Ying.

He Ying, this "Minister," was the most idle one among the Ministers, having to work part-time in the commercial trade department most of the time. Hearing there was a matter to show face this time, immediately volunteered: "I can go."

"...The 4th Advanced Police Training Class Graduation and Rank Conferment Ceremony, can't Ran Yao preside over this himself? I understand, Navy and Army rank conferment ceremonies invited the Executive Committee to attend before; this comes to find balance. My opinion is in the future such similar promotion and elevation of various departments, conduct within the headquarters, don't rise to the Government Administration Council level."

These words caused unanimous approval among attending Senators. Except for Wen, Wang, Ma, and Senators serving in the Fubo Army, almost no Senator had presided over ceremonies like awarding honors and conferring ranks. More or less some envy, jealousy, and hate. Now all cancelled, it became fair. As for conducting a rank or commedation within the headquarters to satisfy the addiction of being a leader, it also became internal affairs needing no report to the Government Administration Council.

"...Manya Steel Plant New Process Silicon Steel Technology Demonstration Meeting, I know a little about this. Silicon steel is currently a serious shortcoming on our tech tree. Currently mass-produced silicon steel sheets put in the old... Australia are not even as good as waste quality, choking the neck of all electrical equipment, even electronic industry, for example relays..."

Ma Qianzhu seemed to have been smashed in the back of the head by silicon steel, speaking incessantly about technical details for fully five minutes, as if just reacting. "Sorry for off-topic, these were all learned when participating in the Punch Card Machine Technology Demonstration Meeting some time ago." Ma Qianzhu lowered his head to flip a few pages of documents, continued to say "This is very important. I see I better go personally..."

Xiao Zishan was anxious, hurriedly reminded in a low voice: "There is a conflict in time."

Ma Qianzhu seemed to have just reacted: "Oh oh, right. Doesn't matter. The demonstration meeting opens for three days; I'll just go on the last day." He quickly made a few strokes in the notebook, "There is also a Danzhou Industrial Park Planning Scheme Technology Demonstration Meeting, this is a bit complex. Director Zhan, you speak..."
