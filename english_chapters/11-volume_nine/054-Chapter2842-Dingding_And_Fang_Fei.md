# Chapter 2842 Dingding and Fang Fei

He laid out the basic requirements: candidates could be heroes themselves or the heroes' comrades. The hard criteria were that the model figures must have received at least one First-Class Merit Medal, or one First-Class Valor plus several other medals. Speakers must be fluent in New Speech and eloquent. Model figures' backgrounds should balance all social strata and relevant groups: local natives, new migrants, old migrants, northern migrants, Jiangsu-Zhejiang migrants, Fujian-Guangdong migrants... Additionally, there should be dedicated slots for locally enlisted and volunteered Li and Miao people, as well as Japanese and Korean National Army soldiers. In short, treat everyone equally—no group should appear particularly favored or particularly martial.

After screening, relevant deeds would be forwarded to the Propaganda sector for writing promotional materials. Wei Aiwen had originally planned to add some dedicated writers to the Political Department staff, but the Senate controlled military headquarters staffing very tightly, especially "non-military positions." The basic approach was outsourcing.

Fortunately, the collaboration with Cultural Propaganda had been long-established. They understood this "client's" needs if not intimately, at least "thoroughly." Of course, for each such piece he would either personally write or review the relevant "writing guidelines" to ensure the "contractor" stayed on track.

Wei Aiwen rattled off assignments in one breath, then asked about the review of the storytelling version of *Rising Wind in Lianyang*. *Rising Wind in Lianyang* was set against the bandit suppression and pacification of the Lianzhou-Lianshan-Yangshan region, a novel written by the region's director, Huang Chao.

Though a novel, eighty percent of the content was based on real people and events. Add Director Huang's masterful pen, and it was written with flesh and blood, receiving great acclaim upon publication. It became Cultural Propaganda's next major adaptation target. The "Night Raid on Daliang Market" chapter was currently being adapted by the Puppet Drama Troupe as a major production.

Because it involved military subject matter, Wei Aiwen took it very seriously. He'd spoken to Wang Tao—Wang Tao would take the lead in adapting it into a long-form storytelling piece. However, since it contained extensive military content, it needed Political Department review per regulations.

The work was written by Huang Chao, so naturally it somewhat beautified the protagonist—Wei Aiwen privately grumbled. But since he'd written it, this small privilege was understandable. Just that the emotional arc between Bida and Zhenhuan needed further deepening. After all, the current writing was too bland.

How to strengthen it? Wei Aiwen wasn't a literary person. Racking his brains, all he could think of were plots from various web novels he'd read back in school—and he didn't like reading romance novels, so his reserves in that area were really too thin.

"Isn't there a single novelist among us Senators?" Wei Aiwen thought, deciding to leave it to Wang Tao to figure out. After all, he had adaptation experience.

He wrote several revision suggestions for the storytelling adaptation, then revised the "memos" on military propaganda matters he'd worked on all night. Truth be told, the naturalized-citizen officers in the General Staff Political Department were among the most educated in Fubo Army, yet he still couldn't let his guard down.

He tossed the memo to the female orderly outside, then finally closed the office door, intending to catch up on sleep on the camp bed. But once lying down, Wei Aiwen couldn't sleep. He couldn't help pondering the speaking tour.

The speaking tour was Wei Aiwen's most urgent project. Though the task sounded huge, it actually had the most solid foundation among all projects. Before the war, he'd already arranged "embedded reporter" work. Wei Aiwen had wanted to run military newspapers and magazines, but the Senate didn't approve. Even military publications fell under Cultural Propaganda. So there was no question of having his own reporters. He could only ask the Propaganda Department to select a batch of reporters as "embedded reporters," and also had each company clerk take on a "news correspondent" role. Good writing or not aside, as long as they could record the relevant stories.

Now the "embedded reporters" had mostly returned, and the "correspondents" had come back with their units. Plus reports sent back earlier via military mail—sifting through carefully, it was easy to pick out some good material, then do supplementary interviews to select the first batch of representative figures.

He remembered as a child being organized by school to attend "Old Mountain Combat Heroes Speaking Sessions." What he'd most liked hearing wasn't actually the combat process, but life in the cat-ear bunkers... Suddenly he sat bolt upright and wrote in his notebook: "Every propaganda draft must go through my review"—reminding himself that when subordinates submitted their plans, he must pass on this latest instruction.

Dingding stared at the tortuous Gantt chart in his notebook. The thrill of power had been drowned by the tidal wave of work. They said power and status were the best aphrodisiac, but even taking pills constantly, doing it seven times nightly every day was too much.

The laptop screen before him displayed the Mainland Cultural Strategy project plan. The entire project had been subdivided into seven sub-project plans due to its complexity. Scheduled tasks already numbered over two thousand, many of which were also interconnected, requiring consolidation and coordination. Dingding felt his brain insufficient, which was why he'd retrieved his laptop from Gaoshan Ridge and had IT Senators help install Project.

"...The Shandong Region Folk Doctor Training Class has tentatively selected Qimu Island as its site. Instructors will be provided by the Shandong Detachment's Medical Unit. Requesting Command to coordinate student organization and conduct necessary decontamination and literacy preparation. Starting date to be coordinated by Command based on preparation progress..."

"...Machinery General Factory plans to dispatch a flour equipment exhibition team to Hangzhou for on-site demonstration. Requesting Command to coordinate with local merchants, transport ships, and Hangzhou Station to provide security..."

The female secretary read off over a dozen "requests" in one breath. Dingding stared at the screen without typing a single character—actually not listening either. A voice kept repeating in his head: "What do these idiots take me for? Things they could coordinate themselves, they all run to me."

"Darling, should I continue? The rest are all similar—requests to coordinate resources." Panpan, who was in the office preparing to discuss work with him, flipped through the reports. "I think you need an assistant to help handle this. This work can't be done well just by working overtime. Why not go home early today."

If Dingding hadn't been staring blankly at the screen, he might have noticed Panpan's gaze. These past few years, though the couple had significant philosophical differences, after their work content was adjusted, their relationship had actually mellowed. Overall, Dingding focused on running his "two periodicals and one newspaper," handling propaganda; Panpan managed the rest—mainly media and publishing.

Panpan had made media and publishing flourish these past few years. Though she rather disliked the Truth Office's revisions, considering they still needed to conceal their true identities as time-travelers, she could accept this censorship.

As business grew, Panpan's original ideals had somewhat shifted. A media mogul's interests and an ordinary reporter's interests obviously couldn't sit in the same chair. Her views on Dingding the "Propaganda Minister" had become less sharp.

Shifts in mindset naturally affected emotions. So in recent years, the two had been "harmonious as harp and lute." Recently Dingding had been absorbed in "Cultural Strategy," inevitably neglecting his wife.

Just as Dingding hadn't yet grasped his wife's meaning, an untimely knock came at the door. Fang Fei pushed open the door holding a box of files, saw Panpan, and froze momentarily, keenly realizing his timing was "inappropriate." He could only squeeze out a smile in greeting. Panpan found an excuse and withdrew first, leaving the two. Fang Fei watched her leave, thinking Dingding would probably be spending the night on the balcony again.

"Old Fang, if you're here to ask me to coordinate with other departments, hold off. My head's already big enough." Dingding collapsed against the chair back, looking more exhausted than ever. He turned the screen toward Fang Fei, pointing at the forest-like Gantt chart. Fang Fei knew that when Dingding called him "Old Fang," it meant he was really in a bad mood, needing an old friend to help share his burdens. Otherwise Dingding would call him "Department Head Fang" or "Director Fang."

Fang Fei listened to Dingding's half-hour grievance session—half about how hard he himself had it, half about how shameless the various departments' demands were. Taking the files from Dingding's desk, Fang Fei roughly grasped Dingding's troubles. It was like having your son ask you to help with a math homework problem—you expect addition and subtraction, but he hands you a Fourier transform.

While Fang Fei reviewed the documents, Dingding went out to wash his face and clear his head, then had the secretary pour two iced coffees. He put them on the coffee table by the sofa, drinking while continuing to expound to Fang Fei. In Dingding's view, some of these requests were clearly sabotage—like troublemaker subordinates he'd seen in the old timeline, escalating problems that shouldn't be reported up, calling it "seeking help" but really embarrassing superiors. If management didn't understand the situation or technology, making decisions for them meant digging your own grave—you'd take the blame if things went wrong. Doing nothing became the subordinate's excuse for delays. The right answer was to roar "What are you good for then?" Only Dingding wasn't on home turf—he neither dared nor could.

"Who exactly does Jeju Island fall under?"

"What?" Just as Dingding was spraying spittle everywhere, Fang Fei asked this seemingly unrelated question. For a moment he couldn't understand what Fang Fei was getting at.

"I mean Jeju Island and Kaohsiung—these three places, excluding garrisons, who does the local administration report to?" Fang Fei pushed aside the files and laptop, also moving to the sofa. He picked up the coffee and took a sip before continuing: "Feng Zongze and Wei Bachi, these two overseas officials—who should they be reporting to?"
