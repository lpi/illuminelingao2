# Chapter 2823 Peony House

The source of the tantalizing aroma was a row of open sales windows facing Baihui Street. The lower half of the windows was a row of waist-high counters. The counter's overall frame was wooden, but large glass panels were installed on the street-facing side, allowing passersby to effortlessly see the goods displayed inside. The clerks behind the counter wore yellow-top, red-bottom short outfits, with the same M-shaped arch logo as the rooftop pinned to their tops. Some clerks were male, some female, but all wore the same strange red-and-yellow cap.

The cap was overall like the common "yitong liuhe" cap seen locally, but with a forward-projecting brim, looking somewhat incongruous. Zahra noticed one clerk inside the counter holding a long-handled basket-like container made of thick iron wire, filled with clusters of golden long strips. The clerk poured the strips into a rectangular iron pan while evenly sprinkling some white seasoning mixed with a small amount of black powder. With his movements, the earlier fragrance became even richer. Roiling in several other oil pans were fluffy sheet-like items coated in golden batter.

The clerk kept stirring the pan, using a special slotted spoon to portion the fried goods into bags made of newspaper, then displayed them in the case before him. Another clerk kept calling out: "Fresh out of the oven Australian Fries! Two cents for a large serving—guaranteed you'll want more!" "Fish and chips, special deal at five cents!" Before Zahra could react, the adventurous Sonya had already paid and grabbed two portions.

The selling clerk was a sharp-eyed naturalized young man who knew these two strangely dressed foreign girls were most likely Senators' life secretaries. He quickly directed the girls upstairs to the premium seating area to enjoy at leisure. The two entered through the door beside the sales counter. Facing them was a wood-carved panel embedded in the wall, depicting scenes of life in some medieval city. If Senator Xu had come, he would have recognized it as part of *Along the River During the Qingming Festival*. For the girls, the lines just seemed detailed and interesting.

One side of the passage leading upstairs was the dine-in area. The walls were the uncommon white brick, looking quite clean and simple. On the walls hung pictures introducing dishes and propaganda posters mass-printed by the Propaganda Department. Since this was a restaurant, themes were basically about food hygiene and safety—adding considerable interest to the otherwise monotone walls. The floor used tiles commonly seen in Senator bathrooms, only in alternating white and brown, quite decorative. The tables and chairs scattered in groups of threes and fives were also IKEA-style; the girls just thought they looked like the Australian furniture at home.

The other side of the passage was a style the girls had never seen. Above the half-height white wall were large dividing glass panels. From screen windows at the top came food aromas mixed with heat. Through the glass, one could see rows of stove openings set in the wall spewing flames, wooden prep boards laden with various ingredients before the stoves, and staff in red-yellow uniforms with white aprons bustling around ingredients and stoves.

This scene was quite shocking. In this timeline, not only had Mencius said "the gentleman stays far from the kitchen," but kitchens worldwide were unsightly places kept secret from the public. Displaying one so openly to the public was unheard of. Yet this somewhat crowded, chaotic-looking place had an odd, compact, and uniform Australian quality.

The observant Zahra particularly noticed a row of circular mechanical devices hanging above the stoves. Each time a chef used a long-handled spatula to push a round dough covered with various toppings into the stove, he would specifically give this thing a twist. From time to time it emitted a crisp ring, at which point the chef would shovel out the finished product—emitting an enticing aroma—and immediately plate it for serving.

The girls didn't know that what they were seeing was actually a standardized fast-food kitchen far ahead of its time. Emulating modern restaurant enterprises from another timeline, Peony House employed the unbeatable weapons of chain dining: central kitchen, cold-chain delivery, standard operations, and uniform brand image.

Every day before dawn, cargo coaches using special cold-chain transport boxes—filled with ice and lined with diatomite—delivered uniformly pre-processed semi-finished ingredients from the central kitchen on East Gate Market's outskirts to each branch.

Branches with conditions stored them in their own gas-powered cold storage; those without used old-fashioned iceboxes with ice inside. Subsequent operations were strictly standardized, with prescribed methods, steps, and even specific temperatures and times for finishing. This method, invincible in the old timeline, proved equally effective in the new. Even if it couldn't guarantee fresh, perfect flavor, it provided uniform quality and reliable food standards. The steadily rising sales since branch openings proved the point.

Naturally, limited by cold-chain conditions, Peony House's cold-chain delivery could currently only reach as far as Hong Kong and Guangzhou—beyond that was unfeasible. In fact, even across all of Hainan, very few areas could accept cold-chain delivery.

Of course, these methods were also easier said than done. Setting aside everything else, just the standardized kitchenware custom-made for this kind of kitchen had given the responsible Senators headaches. For example, the circular devices Sonya noticed were simple mechanical timers specially requested from the Technology Department. The circular dial had several marks representing different times; turn the circle to the corresponding position, and after different intervals, a bell would trigger—greatly standardizing baking times. Additionally, similar custom items like gas ovens, frying equipment needed for fries and corresponding specialized thermometers—all took considerable effort.

But the girls were just curious. Sonya was already carrying the still-warm fries and leading the way upstairs. The upstairs layout was basically the same as downstairs, just without the kitchen area and with a row of street-facing floor-to-ceiling windows. Additionally, on the ceiling ran a power shaft through the entire building, driving several ceiling fans spinning leisurely. Together with linen tablecloths and napkins on the tables, compared to the casual section downstairs, the class level was greatly elevated.

It was still early; upstairs had few customers, just a few girls in Australian-style plaid skirts chattering away. The two went straight over and picked a spot facing the street center. The young waitress serving upstairs came over to help lower the bamboo sun blinds. Zahra noticed her uniform was somewhat different—though bearing the same logo as downstairs, it was mainly pink in color and in a dress style, somewhat similar to the maid school's uniform.

The waitress then handed over two booklets. The bamboo covers bore the Peony House logo and "Menu" in large characters. The girls opened them to find each page listing mains, snacks, and drinks by category—all clearly priced, with the main ingredients labeled under each food item. Like all foreign language learners, the multitude of ingredient names made the girls dizzy. They simply took out the discount coupon the popsicle boy had given and handed it to the waitress.

The waitress was clearly very familiar with this. Without even looking, she announced: "Then one medium Seafood Supreme Flatbread. Would you ladies also like our house-special Crispy Honey-Glazed Chicken Wings, paired with a large bottle of chilled Australian Kvass—only forty-five cents total." Zahra did a quick mental calculation, felt it was within budget, and nodded to confirm the order. Sonya specifically kept a menu, saying she wanted to look at it more.

While waiting for their order, Sonya opened the warm paper packet in her hands. The packet was made from *Lingao Times*, just stamped with Peony House's logo in wood. Inside were steaming fries and fish fillets in batter.

This kind of thing wasn't rare in Lingao; it had been around for several years. But since it required large amounts of cooking oil, it only appeared sporadically on Senators' tables. Peony House was pioneering the popularization of fried foods.

This naturally owed to the abundant results of years of Senate promotion of oil palm cultivation in Vietnam, southern Hainan, and elsewhere. Though oil palm cultivation faced many difficulties, the shortage of cooking oil had always been a sore point for the Senators. Thus, the Agriculture Committee had made tremendous efforts to solve the problem of large-scale production of oil crops.

The two began imitating others' eating methods, trying their first-ever fish and chips. Since they had already identified on the menu that fries' main ingredients were "Australian potato, salt, and black pepper seasoning," the girls' expectations had actually lowered considerably. After all, potatoes were already a common item on the Senator menu. Whether spicy stir-fried potato shreds or beef with potatoes, neither was novel anymore. As for the fried fish's main ingredient, "deep-sea fish fillet," that was the most common food in the Senate cafeteria.

But the fries in their mouths tasted unexpectedly different. Salt grains with a hint of black pepper flavor, paired with crispy fried coating, with soft, slightly sweet flesh inside. How could this possibly be the usual potatoes! From this moment on, Zahra became a die-hard fan of fries. She even tried frying them at home multiple times, but just couldn't replicate Peony House's flavor.

Fries were never a simple task suitable for home cooks. Taking the old-timeline Mickey D's as an example: setting aside needing specially cultivated potato varieties, at the factory there was careful selection and cutting, the oil needed infamous trans fats added to extend shelf life—and just temperature control during frying alone would defeat most home cooks.
