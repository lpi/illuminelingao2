# Chapter 2856: Chance Encounter

Guo Xi’er watched as He Xiaoyue laughed for a long time, tears squeezing out of her eyes. The shop assistant beside them looked terrified, thinking a lunatic had arrived, and felt incredibly awkward. Taking advantage of the moment when He Xiaoyue finally ran out of breath and squatted on the ground clutching her stomach, the assistant quickly pulled her up, her face full of disgust: "What kind of fit are you throwing?"

"Sheep-horn fit!" He Xiaoyue, though weak all over, couldn't resist joking.

"Stop it." Guo Xi’er hurriedly covered her mouth and waved her hand at the bewildered assistant: "It's nothing, it's nothing, we'll just browse by ourselves."

He Xiaoyue had regained some strength by now. Resting her hand on Guo Xi’er’s arm, she slowly stood up: "Sorry, sorry, I really couldn't help it." With that, she opened the magazine again, looking at it over and over. She poked and pointed at the page, as if wishing she could swallow the picture whole. The two of them looked for a while, then laughed for a while, making the shop assistant’s hair stand on end—had two madwomen arrived? Though they looked quite respectable!

"Now, we've made it!" He Xiaoyue said. "Promotion and a raise are right in front of us..."

He Xiaoyue was the lead designer for the "Drizzle on Duckweed" outfit, and Guo Xi’er was considered the secondary author. After all, designing and making an outfit entirely by one person was a bit strenuous. They were essentially a freelance design team. Of course, He Xiaoyue played the main role, and Guo Xi’er was well aware of this.

With "Drizzle on Duckweed" winning an award, He Xiaoyue would certainly soar to great heights, but she, Guo Xi’er, would also benefit somewhat—much like what Prefect Liu had said about a fly on a horse's tail.

Seeing her new sister rising rapidly, it was inevitable to feel a little sourness in her heart. However, she was not a scheming person. Coupled with the fact that she felt she had her sister to fall back on, who had promised she would "return to the Senator's side in the future," her desire to fight for fame and profit was much weaker. Moreover, as the "friendship" between the two deepened these days, Guo Xi’er, who had never had much of a mind of her own, increasingly regarded He Xiaoyue as her "backbone."

While He Xiaoyue was the biggest beneficiary of this success, it was no small help to Guo Xi’er either. At least in front of her sister, she was no longer a useless blunderer; she had achieved something, after all.

"Let's go have a big meal!" Guo Xi’er proposed.

Originally, Guo Xi’er’s behavior was just subconscious and hadn't been carefully thought out. But her sister had intended for them to deepen their "sisterly affection" and had intentionally or unintentionally told Guo Xi’er to "treat Xiaoyue well."

How to treat her well? Interactions between young girls mostly involved shopping and eating. Although Guo Xi’er’s salary wasn't high, she had her sister as a backer, so she was very well-off financially.

"Okay, okay." He Xiaoyue nodded repeatedly. "Where to?"

"Apricot Blossom Tower, of course!"

He Xiaoyue clicked her tongue. The predecessor of Apricot Blossom Tower was the Commercial Hall Restaurant. Before the Longhaowan Hotel opened, it was the most luxurious and high-end restaurant under the Senate's rule. Senators mostly chose this place to banquet important guests; it was a place only "people of status" went.

"Too, too expensive."

"What are you afraid of!" Guo Xi’er said. "I have the supplementary card my sister gave me."

"Is that okay?" He Xiaoyue was still somewhat hesitant. This "supplementary card" was needless to say sent by Senator Liu Xiang, the Prefect of Guangzhou.

She was a cadre from Guangzhou, so naturally she knew about the affair between Liu Xiang and Guo Xi’er. The problem was that Guo Xi’er no longer had the status of a Life Secretary. Using this thing to pay was somewhat unjustifiable.

"Nothing wrong with it; it's my sister's," Guo Xi’er said carelessly.

"In that case, I'll sponge off the rich!" He Xiaoyue knew Guo Xi’er had no guile, so there was no need to be too calculating in their interactions.

The two were in a great mood and turned to another rack to look at other clothes, not noticing a young man looking at them from not far away.

The man lingered for a long time, seeming to make up his mind. He walked over with light steps, bowed slightly and politely, and said, "Ladies..."

Both were startled. Although the social atmosphere in Lingao was "ahead of the world" and most open, strangers striking up conversations on the street was still somewhat abrupt.

He Xiaoyue was bolder after all, not as flustered as Guo Xi’er. She immediately swept him with her eyes. The man opposite was only about twenty years old. Not exactly handsome, but he had regular features. His wheat-colored skin, short hair, and "cadre suit" all indicated he was a naturalized employee. Moreover, the texture and style of his clothes, shirt collar, and shoes suggested the comer was a "cadre" engaged in office work. The temperament he exuded also contained a certain "Chief" quality—he likely had a relatively deep relationship with a Senator...

Her mood toward the man before her instantly softened a lot. She smiled and asked, "What is it?"

"If I'm not mistaken, you two must be the designers of 'Drizzle on Duckweed' featured in this issue of *Lingao Spring*, right?" The young man spoke New Speech with a slight Cantonese accent.

"How did you know she is He Xiaoyue?" Guo Xi’er widened her eyes and blurted out.

"Although I haven't met you, both ladies are carrying Wanzi Pavilion bags, and your dress and temperament are unlike those of seamstresses or shop assistants. The way you look at clothes in the store is also different from ordinary people..." The young man spoke calmly, without the nervous unease young men often had when meeting the opposite sex. "As far as I know, there are only two young female designers like this at Wanzi Pavilion."

He Xiaoyue couldn't help but look at her own attire. This young man's powers of observation were truly impressive!

"You guessed exactly right!" He Xiaoyue felt there was no need to hide it at this point and admitted it openly. "What do you need from us?"

"Let me introduce myself first. My name is Chen Shixin. I work in the Mass Arts Division of the Propaganda Department, and I am currently interning at the Coconut Grove Photo Studio on rotation." Chen Shixin said, "Although it's a bit presumptuous, I have two requests. I wonder if you ladies could agree?"

Seeing that he was polite, well-featured, and a naturalized cadre, Guo Xi’er already had a favorable impression of him. She said, "Just say it!"

He Xiaoyue smiled helplessly and said, "As long as we can do it..."

"First, I'd like to ask you to give me an autograph..."

Guo Xi’er happily agreed after learning his intention and pulled He Xiaoyue to sign one quickly as well.

"...The second request is a bit abrupt," Chen Shixin said. "I'm interning at the photo studio and want to take a few portrait photos for window display. Both of you are very photogenic and will look great in photos." As he spoke, he took out a Propaganda Department work ID. The work unit column indeed read "Internship at Coconut Grove Photo Studio."

Although photography was a novelty that had only gradually appeared in recent years, it wasn't rare to them. The fashion industry itself had a close relationship with painting and photography, so it wasn't strange to them.

"Taking photos is no problem, but putting them in the window..." Guo Xi’er hesitated. "My sister probably won't agree. She says I might still..."

Here, her foot was stepped on by He Xiaoyue, and she quickly swallowed her words.

"I don't mind." He Xiaoyue was quite open about these "public appearances."

"That's great!" Chen Shixin nodded in thanks. "Photography and photo studios are new things; people don't understand the principles behind them yet. With your assistance, everyone will accept this new thing faster."

"It's a pity photos are black and white. If only they could be colored like paintings," Guo Xi’er said regretfully. "Like that 'Drizzle on Duckweed' outfit—such beautiful color matching, but the magazine doesn't show it at all."

"Indeed, my master says the same. He says for photography to catch up with painting, it will take another hundred years! But the Chief says it won't take too long..."

"Your master is probably a Senator, right?" He Xiaoyue probed.

"That's not it." Chen Shixin laughed. "He is an Italian, Master Trini."

"So it's him!" Both girls knew of this Italian. Master Trini was probably the most famous European in all of Lingao. Starting from doing renovations for the Senate, he had become the big boss of Lingao's largest art training class. Not only had he paid off the huge debt he owed from being tricked by Lando back then, but he had also made a fortune. Now he only accepted commissions from Senators and the wealthiest people in Lingao.

"You are his apprentice?!" He Xiaoyue looked him up and down in disbelief. "Really?"

"Of course it's true." Chen Shixin nodded. "Senator Hong recommended me to study there back then."

"Hong Huangnan!" Guo Xi’er suddenly cried out.

This surprised Chen Shixin a little. This Senator Hong didn't have high visibility outside, and he had been in Guangdong for the past few years, rarely returning to Lingao.

He Xiaoyue seemed to be thinking about something and asked, "So, you are also a painter!"

Chen Shixin nodded slightly: "Barely counting as one. I can't compare with my master and senior fellow apprentices."

"Oh, oh, oh, don't be so modest." Guo Xi’er laughed even more happily, though it was unclear what exactly she was happy about.

"We agree to the photo shoot," He Xiaoyue suddenly spoke more fluently, "but I also have a request."

Now it was Chen Shixin's turn to be stunned: "What?"

"Can you give us some pointers on painting techniques?"

This wasn't a whim of He Xiaoyue's. Since becoming a fashion designer, she had gradually felt that the painting skills she learned in the "Garment Craft Training Class" were too shallow. Currently, when she drew fashion design renderings, she could only draw on pre-printed figure templates. She couldn't sketch the human body and clothes casually like some Senators did to show various wearing effects.

Chen Shixin hesitated slightly: "Painting? It's not impossible..." Probably feeling his attitude seemed like an evasion, he quickly explained: "It's just that painting is a long-term endeavor, not something that can be explained clearly in a few words..."

"Of course, of course." He Xiaoyue nodded busily. "How about this: since you want us to be models, and we want to ask for your pointers, why don't you join us for dinner, and we can chat at the table?"

Guo Xi’er didn't have much interest in painting, but she had a good impression of him and wanted to hear about photography and painting. So she chimed in agreement.

"Isn't that too abrupt?" Chen Shixin hesitated.

"It doesn't matter." He Xiaoyue knew her invitation was quite bold. But if he wasn't boasting and was really Trini's disciple, then her boldness today would bring her new, perhaps very rich, returns.
