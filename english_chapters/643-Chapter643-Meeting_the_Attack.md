# Chapter 643 Meeting the Attack

"Commander-in-Chief, the Hair Bandits have established their camp with the sea at their backs; they are already in a desperate position!" Chang Qingyun said. "They dare to do so only relying on their navy's cover. If our army sends the Water Mine Militia from Xiaoyingchang tonight under the cover of darkness to release *Hun Jiang Long* (Muddy River Dragons), we can destroy their warships..."

He Rubin had indeed recruited and organized a Water Mine Militia of three hundred men before the war and manufactured five hundred *Hun Jiang Long* water mines. Because they were prepared for use when establishing the siege of Bopu, most water mines and sampans for releasing mines were not transported from Baishashui Fortress; only one hundred were brought with the army.

"Without sampans, how to release them?" A private secretary raised a doubt.

Chang Qingyun said confidently: "It doesn't matter. Just send people to lower the water mines at Xiaoyingchang and release them with the current—Student sees Xiaoyingchang protrudes into the sea; releasing water mines will surely be no problem..."

Tang Yunwen finally couldn't help but say: "Mr. Chang! The current in Qiongzhou Strait flows from west to east in these months."

Every summer, the Qiongzhou Strait blew a southwest monsoon, and the ocean current followed the wind direction. Water mines released at Xiaoyingchang, east of the Hair Bandit camp, couldn't possibly drift over; they might drift to Qiongshan County instead.

"Oh," Chang Qingyun was slightly embarrassed, but immediately said, "It doesn't matter if the current direction isn't right. The militia are mostly Tanka people, skilled in swimming. They can enter the water at night and push the water mines to the Hair Bandit warships."

He Rubin, however, wasn't interested in this suggestion. The enemy gunships merely covered the flank and rear of the Hair Bandit Grand Camp. As long as the enemy camp could be broken tomorrow, those gunships floating on the sea would be useless. Back then, the Dutchmen had so many cannons on their large planked ships, but they could only watch helplessly as the Great Ming army besieged their fortress on Penghu Island without being able to help a bit. As long as his own men and horses didn't foolishly run to the seaside.

He instructed his subordinate generals to let the soldiers rest well today and prepare for battle tomorrow, and ordered each camp to pay attention to keeping watch to prevent enemy night raids. When descending the gate tower, he saw the enem camp was already brightly lit, with sounds of military drums and bugles echoing each other. It could be seen that the defense was extremely strict, and discipline in the camp was also very good. He couldn't help but harbor great doubts about whether the enemy was a "disorderly mob."

Just as the sky brightened the next day, the reveille in the Fubo Army Grand Camp blew loudly. He Ming got up very early to prepare for battle. After finishing breakfast, the last reinforcement unit arrived from Lingao: the "Sniper Team" composed of Senators. It gathered all Senators skilled in shooting, including gun enthusiasts from the North American Branch and former shooting athletes who had been in the shooting training team before. Although they couldn't charge into battle directly, their skill in precision shooting was unmatched by anyone in this space-time.

The weapons used by these dozen people were varied, but almost all were bolt-action rifles brought by the North American Branch. The Mosin-Nagant, cheap and plentiful in North America, occupied half the territory, while Qian Shui-ting distinctively carried a Swiss-made K31 straight-pull rifle, a high-precision bolt-action rifle. Zhou Weisen carried a Remington 700 rifle. All sniper rifles were equipped with 6x scopes. Along with the Sniper Team came the cameramen of the Propaganda Department, preparing to film a documentary to publicize the Fubo Army's illustrious military achievements.

The captains of the Special Reconnaissance Team invariably had digital DVs, but they were all home-grade machines. This time Dingding and others brought semi-professional digital video cameras with professional-grade telephoto lenses.

He Ming instructed to disperse the Sniper Team to various towers, and some were placed in the cannon emplacements on the earthen rampart—a sniper's power wouldn't be lower than a cannon. In addition, three cadets were assigned to each Senator as observers and guards. Unless there were instructions, they could freely choose fire targets—generals and officers were the primary targets.

Although Dingding repeatedly requested to go to the front line for filming, He Ming still didn't send him up the earthen rampart, but arranged for him to set up filming tracks on the command platform where he was.

"I'm not afraid of danger. To shoot this kind of documentary film, one must rush to the front line."

"You'll be in the way at the front." He Ming said unceremoniously. "Also, you just film later, no talking allowed."

"When cleaning the battlefield, I want to go to the front line..."

"I'll arrange for you to go then."

After distributing snipers and cameramen, He Ming gathered all chief officers at the battalion level for a pre-war meeting. The meeting briefed on the movement that the Ming army had occupied Xiaoyingchang last night. Of course, this had no impact on the impending battle.

As the meeting was about to end, he looked at the Senator officers assembled in the headquarters: dark circles around many people's eyes; obviously, they hadn't slept well. It was natural for people going onto the battlefield for the first time.

"Comrades, the battle is about to begin immediately." He said briefly to everyone. "For this day, everyone has trained bitterly with recruits on the drill ground for two years. Now is the time to embody your training results." He swept a glance at everyone, "Execute according to the pre-set plan! Dismissed!"

All officers saluted together.

He Ming stood at attention and returned the salute, finally saying: "Go fight, comrades!"

On the ramparts, two infantry battalions had already been brought behind the breastworks, and each company was assigned a combat position. The order to the company commanders was very simple:

"Fight here to the end!"

Everyone received 200 rounds of ammunition. Five hundred reserve Minié rifles had been sent from the rear a few days ago, in case the battle was too intense and too many guns were damaged leaving no guns available. Soldiers were seizing the last moments to wipe their guns and check ammunition. Officers walked back and forth checking fortifications and soldiers' gear.

Wei Aiwen patrolled the dike with his guard, chatting with soldiers occasionally, using a serene and calm attitude to soothe the soldiers' emotions. Actually, he was also very nervous inside. But he tried his best to appear calm and composed.

Two Battalion Army Flags were erected on two bastions respectively: Infantry 3rd Battalion Commander You Laohu and Infantry 5th Battalion Commander Fu Sansi. They commanded troops directly on two key bastions. Both men wore brand new uniforms, wearing symbols of all honors they had ever won. You Laohu sat on a chair, hands resting on the Frontier Army Long Saber given by President Wen. Fu Sansi smoked thoughtfully, an SKS with bayonet already unfolded placed by his hand.

All cannons, whether from artillery companies or reserve cannons, had been pulled onto the earthen dike without a single one left yesterday, placed in cannon emplacements. Ten "Typewriters" sponsored by the Navy were also placed in some key positions. Several of them were mounted on wheelbarrows for mobile defense. Sailors wearing blue uniforms stood at their positions, a blue and white Navy flag fluttering.

The Field Army's flag fluttered in the center of the camp. He Ming and staff officers had already ascended the high platform in the center of the camp. Wired telephones, walkie-talkies, and telegraphs connected him with all troops.

The 6th Infantry Battalion, acting as the army reserve, formed a square formation under the high platform.

"All sit down!" Zhu Quanxing ordered loudly, then he sat on the ground himself, waiting for the order to enter combat.

Company after company, army flag after army flag, 1,800 infantrymen wearing gray uniforms tightly gripped bayoneted rifles in their hands. Behind them were 2,000 militia, all holding spears, ready to join the final slaughter at any time.

It was quiet all around. The entire Field Army camp had quieted down completely. No drums or bugles, no human noise. Except for the occasional messenger hurrying past and sounds of orders, only the flapping sound of army flags was heard.

Yang Zeng stood on the earthen dike, holding a command saber in his hand. Although the weather wasn't good, he could still clearly see government soldiers constantly pouring out from various camps and lining up in the distance. After men and horses assembled, with a signal cannon sound, the whole army marched towards the seaside. Whether from the perspective of Senators or native officers, the Ming army's array was hard to call orderly, but the momentum was astonishing. A black mass pressing towards here.

The Ming army advanced for a few *li*. With a long horn sound, the marching column stopped three *li* from the Grand Camp. Archers and firearms troops walked to the front row; one row kneeling, one row standing, ready to release arrows and fire guns at any time. Behind were rows of spearmen, with swordsmen on both wings ready to fight.

*They are as many as black clouds!* Yang Zeng thought, involuntarily tightening his grip on the command saber. *There will be a fierce battle today!*

The civil and military officials under He Rubin standing on the Chengmai County seat wall also had this premonition. Soldiers filled the Hair Bandit camp's earthen dike, but not a single sound of clamor came over. The other side was extremely quiet, seeming to wait in full battle array to deal a head-on blow to the attacking government army. This feeling made many people unhappy.

Qian Taichong squeezed among the crowd of private secretaries, craning his neck to look at the distant Hair Bandit camp. He was surprised that a band of sea pirates could build such a large-scale and orderly military camp. He had never seen such a camp construction method—piling earth into a dike no more than a man's height, with many large sharp angles protruding all around. How could such a camp be defended? *Just overseas barbarians after all!* He thought so, but in his mind, he was deliberating on the "Six Chapters on Aftermath" prepared to be presented to Lord Zhao after the war. This article was written by him taking time every night in the last few days. He sorted out various methods of soothing people and aftermath management after military chaos that he read from books and heard from others, then selected and organized them according to the situation in Lingao he heard from Gou Chengxuan, finally listing them into this lengthy discourse. Divided into six chapters: "Soothing the People," "Relief," "Opening Wasteland," "Recruiting Merchants," "Arresting Culprits," and "Comforting the Loyal." Qian Taichong read his article again and again, occasionally praising the exquisite sentences he wrote.

In the South Gate camp, Chiliarch Song Ming was ready to sortie. Tong Yizhen gave him one hundred cavalry. He knew in a while his cavalry would lead the vanguard to probe the enemy camp. This was an extremely dangerous mission because he heard the enemy firearms were very powerful—Chiliarch He's disastrous defeat yesterday proved the rumors were not empty. This probe very likely would be a one-way trip.

The hundred cavalry had lined up outside the trench. Each cavalryman carried a bow and arrows, preparing to release arrows to harass the enemy after approaching the camp wall, probing the enemy's defense strength and finding weaknesses in the camp. If enemy cavalry responded, they would retreat immediately.

Three signal cannon shots rang out. He saw a red flag already hung on the city wall. Immediately raising his long spear, he shouted: "Kill!" He spurred his horse out first. Behind were one hundred cavalrymen. The standard-bearer and a dozen personal soldiers followed him closely.

Instantly hoofbeats shook the ground, killing shouts shook the sky. Men and horses in the camped battalions shouted and beat drums to cheer. The momentum was astonishing. A slight commotion arose on the earthen dike.

"Steady! Steady!" Officers on the earthen dike drew command sabers and roared. He Ming ordered: "Artillery hold fire; let them get close and use rifles!"

Song Ming's cavalry rushed to the front of the earthen dike in an instant. The enemy didn't send cavalry or infantry to meet the attack, and didn't even fire firearms—if it were the Great Ming's army, firearms troops would be firing wildly when the enemy was still a hundred *zhang* from the stockade wall. Secretly wondering, because he heard Chiliarch He say yesterday that enemy firearms had very long range, he dared not rush too close, preparing to fire a round of arrows quickly after getting slightly closer to the dike and then retreat.

Just as he spurred his horse past two bastions and turned to unslung his bow, gunshots rang in his ears.

Bullets fired from one side of each of the two bastions swept across the entire cavalry team from the left and right flanks simultaneously. More than twenty riders fell in the galloping cavalry instantly. Seven or eight of Song Ming's personal soldiers fell, and the big flag was also pierced with countless holes. He dared not delay, added a whip to the horse's rump, and rushed out immediately.

He Rubin saw clearly. The enemy Grand Camp was defended very tightly. To attack, troops must break into the space between two protruding angles. Attacking the side of any protruding angle would suffer flanking fire from the adjacent angle. If attacking the front of a protruding angle alone, the front was too narrow to deploy troops at all.

*So the protruding angle fort has such a use!* He Rubin knew the Dutch built forts like this and heard people talk about the benefits of such forts. But he always had some doubts in his heart. Now seeing is believing. When the opponent was an army equipped with superior firearms, the advantage of this kind of fortress was simply too obvious!

Now the Hair Bandit cannons hadn't fired yet; just a volley of bird guns showed such power. He Rubin worried secretly. But he didn't reveal any worried expression, still maintaining a cold, solemn, and fearless appearance of a great general. He called Tong Yizhen over:

"General Tong, the time for you to serve the Imperial Court has arrived. Take the whole army to attack the Hair Bandit South Gate!"

Tong Yizhen received the general order and returned to his camp from the gate tower. Song Ming's men and horses had just returned, having lost nearly thirty riders, and many of the remaining ones were injured.

Seeing him come, Song Ming hurriedly came over to clasp hands and salute.

"No need for ceremony. You take the brothers to rest a moment first; there will be more service for the Court in a while!"

Tong Yizhen knew Song Ming was a brave general who extremely didn't fear death. He was always the first in every charge, often acting recklessly regardless of all danger, nicknamed "General Sending-Life" (*Songming*). Seeing him escape with his life after being cross-fired upon in such a dangerous situation, he couldn't help wondering at this person's luck being so big.

"Yes! Your Excellency!" Song Ming said, "Hair Bandit firearms are extremely fierce..."

"This General knows!" Tong Yizhen didn't say much. Wearing iron armor and an iron helmet, he immediately mounted his horse. Shouting: "Lance!"

A personal soldier immediately handed him a long lance. He looked at the distant camp, raised the lance with a loud roar, and spurred his horse, charging out straight for the South Gate of the Grand Camp. his subordinate Chaozhou soldiers surged forward, while Leilian Lieutenant Colonel Zhao Qiansi led two thousand men and horses charging out from the east of the county seat at the same time, attacking the Hair Bandit Grand Camp from two routes.

For a time drums shook the earth, killing shouts filled the sky. Large and small flags covered the mountains and plains, fluttering in the wind under dark clouds. In the blink of an eye, they had rushed out nearly several hundred meters.

He Ming picked up the telephone: "Artillery fire!"

Zhang Berlin had been waiting for this order. Hearing this order, he immediately commanded: "Fire!"

All cannons had long marked the firing range and loaded ammunition. With one order, battery commanders stood up simultaneously gripping firing lanyards, pulling hard to the rear side.

More than ten cannons facing the enemy's charge direction sprayed long plumes of white smoke. Red cannonballs whistled and flew towards the dense crowd. 12-pounder solid shots flew towards enemies 1000 meters away at an initial velocity of 457 meters per second. Balls of black shadows smashed into the crowd with whistling sounds. Instantly flesh and blood flew. Cannonballs landing on the ground were bounced up by the earth, jumping and rolling backward, ploughing bloody channels in the formation.

The Ming army wasn't stopped by the artillery fire. Soldiers surged forward like a tide. Generals shouted on horseback, galloping back and forth in the ranks to urge soldiers to attack fiercely. The second round of cannonballs flew over again. Rows of soldiers had their heads knocked off, bodies torn open, arms and legs severed by bouncing cannonballs. Blood flew everywhere; broken corpses and screaming wounded were everywhere. Sometimes a cannonball seemed slow enough to be stopped by stepping on it, but it would still mercilessly tear a calf off a person's body.

The recoil of the 12-pounder cannon after firing was shockingly large; a cannon recoiled fully six or seven meters. To save the artillerymen's physical strength and avoid exhaustion slowing down the rate of fire later, each cannon was prepared with three "cannon-pushing groups" composed of auxiliary transport soldiers to help take turns pushing the cannon back to position. As soon as the cannon stopped, these people immediately rushed up to push with shoulders and pull with arms to reset the cannon.

Number 1 gunner holding the sponge immediately inserted the end with the spiral metal rod for cleaning into the bore, stirred forcefully a few times, and hooked out a few pieces of charred and tattered cotton cloth. The cotton cloth wrapping the propellant had been soaked in fuming nitric acid beforehand; theoretically, it should burn away with the propellant when firing, but there was always some residue every time. After clearing the bore, Number 1 gunner reversed the sponge, dipped it in the water bucket, inserted it into the barrel, and began to pump repeatedly to wash the bore.

"Bore clearing complete!"

"Load one solid shot, target distance 940 meters!"
