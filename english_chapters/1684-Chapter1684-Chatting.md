# Chapter 1684 - Chatting

Everyone was attracted by his few words. Yun Suji paused, then drawled:

"Offend the secretary, can't live; offend the team leader, do heavy work; offend the accountant, get poked by the pen; offend the storekeeper, get cheated by the sliding weight; offend the manure digger, three scoops recorded as two!"

As soon as his voice fell, everyone laughed heartily. These farmers didn't know what "secretary" or "team leader" were, but they could taste the flavor inside just the same. Yun Suji knew: there is nothing new under the sun.

Now, everyone's distance was pulled closer. Yun Suji asked about everyone's production situation and whether there was enough grain to eat. Everyone scrambled to speak:

"Grain is enough to eat. Farming here is more than ten times better than back home!" Someone said, "Things grow in the fields all year round. Even families who aren't doing well are full just eating pumpkins."

"It's really thanks to the Chiefs bringing us to this paradise! There's land to farm, enough to eat, and it doesn't freeze in winter."

"It's just that we don't really know how to farm paddy fields. Tiandihui's agricultural technicians come too rarely, and they don't come to the fields of us small households! They only run to the fields of a few big grain households!"

...

"There is too much corvée labor. Planting rice was originally more tiring than planting dry land. Busy for a year, and not allowed to rest in winter!"

Yun Suji had heard villagers talk about the burden of corvée labor more than once and had seen quite a bit with his own eyes, so he asked: "You all say there is too much corvée labor. What kind of labor is it?"

"Everything," Old Yang said. "Building dams, digging canals, leveling land, paving roads... everything. Even when materials for the brick and tile factory arrive at the dock, they call us to unload! When building houses runs out of sand, they call us to dig. When rafts on the Nandu River arrive at the destination, we also have to transport them."

"Building reservoirs and water canals is a good thing," Yun Suji didn't understand. "It all becomes irrigated land, what's bad about it? Bitter first, sweet later."

"Chief, what you said is correct, but the reservoirs and water canals built by the county in these past few years have nothing to do with our village. The water doesn't flow to our fields. Bitter for ourselves, sweet for others! Our village's irrigated land was achieved by the village organizing villagers to work and provide materials to build a canal."

"It was fine in the refugee camp back then; couldn't eat the Chiefs' grain for free. But now that everyone has a family business, how can we farm with so much corvée labor along with it."

"Corvée labor is also unfair. Last time we did corvée labor for the army to transport grain and fodder, the big and small grain households with carts and animals didn't do labor, but called us to push with wheelbarrows!"

"Some households have many laborers, only one goes; some households have only one laborer, yet they still assign you forced labor!"

"Even without corvée labor, there are many levies. Last month, we were assigned to make military shoes. Goodness, regardless of whether there are women in your family, assigned by head count, two pairs per person! Who do I, a bachelor, find to make them?" A young man complained.

...

Yun Suji smoked a cigarette and listened to the myriad of complaints in his ear. Rural affairs were really not ordinarily complicated! He was certainly clear about the various doings of village cadres at the grassroots level; there were bound to be all kinds of evil deeds. Just based on the opinion relatively concentrated among villagers before him: unfair distribution of corvée labor, this point alone was enough to prove that village cadres had economic problems. Not to mention the rude style and beating/scolding of villagers he saw with his own eyes. According to the theory of the Law Society: this was all breaking the law.

However, the village administration he saw all the way here: roads, houses, sanitation, and water canals, were all built by the village organizing the villagers. There were also resolute reforms in changing customs like banning foot-binding. In this regard, the title of model village was well-deserved. Let alone the 17th century, even in the Chinese countryside of the 21st century, Village Head Fan would be a capable and responsible grassroots cadre.

He felt the biggest problem was the "corvée labor" reflected by the villagers. Now it seemed that asking villagers to perform free labor had become a common practice. Villagers were called to do everything. If engaging in farmland water conservancy in winter was a matter of course, calling villagers to do things like unloading cargo and digging sand on ordinary days was inevitably treating the villagers' labor force as too worthless. Arbitrarily occupying labor force also affected agricultural production.

He pondered and asked: "How many grain households do you have here?"

Old Yang said: "Not many, just four or five families."

When refugees were settled, all those settled in standard villages on both banks of the Nandu River were allocated wasteland according to the standard of thirty standard mu per laborer. Tiandihui's tractor team helped to clear the land. Refugee families with more labor naturally received more land.

Although the Senate did not intend to cultivate a class of small owner-peasants with extremely low risk-resistance capability, the material level mastered by the Lingao regime at that time was not enough to convert all refugees into agricultural workers of intensive farms, so they had to adopt this method of distributing land to refugees for production self-help.

Now it seemed this method was quite successful. From statistical data and observations along the way, most refugees in standard villages could support themselves and serve the Senate's cause. Not to mention the surplus agricultural products they provided, the amount of corvée labor every year alone was great wealth.

However, Yun Suji knew well the economic fragility of small owner-peasants. The current good days of small owner-peasants were based on several factors: the Senate's squeeze on agriculture was relatively light; the tension between people and land in Hainan was not acute, and floods and droughts were much fewer than on the mainland; plus a series of agricultural technology promotions by Tiandihui, only then could such a comfortably-off situation be achieved.

In the long run, individual small owner-peasants could not last long. Yun Suji was eager to know the real situation of the "grain households" starting to appear among the immigrants. He knew that new big farming households had popped up in every village—villagers called them grain households. How did these grain households make their fortune? What was their specific production and operation situation? There was still no clear investigation report.

He was just about to ask about the situation of the grain households when he suddenly saw Village Head Fan running over along the ridge of the field.

The village accountant had already organized the group heads of each Jia to come to the village office to meet the Chief, but they couldn't find him anywhere. Finding Old Kong's house, his wife said he followed Old Kong to the fields, so he rushed over.

Although he knew Chief Yun took a look from afar in Old Kong's field, he didn't see an idle person.

Searching from the east end to the west end, and from the west end back to the east end, he finally found him. As soon as he walked over, everyone stopped talking.

He said to Yun Suji: "Chief, let's go back to the village office."

Yun Suji said: "Okay, you go back first, I still want to talk to them."

Village Head Fan said: "What can be discussed with people like them? Let's go back to the office! The group heads of each Jia have all arrived, waiting for the Chief to lecture."

Seeing that he looked down on everyone, Yun Suji wanted to rebuke him, so he spoke half-softly and half-hardly: "talking to them is my job. You go first, I'll come in a while."

Seeing his tone was wrong again, Village Head Fan didn't dare to insist, but wanted to hear what they were talking about, so he was unwilling to walk away and stood outside the circle. Everyone seeing him not leaving, no one opened their mouth, like the Eighteen Arhat statues in a temple, all becoming mutes.

Seeing that everyone dared not speak because he didn't leave, Yun Suji guessed that everyone was afraid of his oppression and wanted to drive him away, so he asked him: 

"Who are you still waiting for?"

He mumbled: "Not waiting for anyone." Saying this, he slipped away.

Yun Suji originally wanted to further dampen his prestige, but thinking that doing so would instead undermine grassroots work, he didn't say more. Speaking of the grain households' situation, everyone said these were "capable people": either because the family had many laborers, and the head of the house knew how to manage or made a fortune by trading local products outside—with surplus money, they hired Tiandihui's tractor team to clear new wasteland, and all expanded their land—the one with the most already had four hundred standard mu of land.

"With so much land, who farms it?"

"Tether animals, buy machines. A set of machines equals several people. If still short of people, hire workers." Old Yang said, "There are always families who are doing poorly."

"Then who does the corvée labor?" Yun Suji felt strange. "If hired workers are assigned corvée labor, doesn't the employer lose out? Crops wait for no one."

"Once you become a hired worker, you don't need to do corvée labor." Old Yang smiled meaningfully. People around laughed. Some young men also joked: "I'll go be a hired worker next year too, won't do corvée labor."

The villagers' talk made Yun Suji believe even more that the new landlords in Borang Village had a relationship of interest with the village head.

Yun Suji took the guards back to the village office and saw Village Head Fan and a dozen "group heads" waiting in the yard. According to the Senate's "Standard Village Organization Method," every ten households in the village were organized into a Jia, with a "group head," similar to the local constable or head of the Baojia system.

Seeing the Chief arrive, Village Head Fan hurriedly led the group heads to bow and salute the Chief. Yun Suji waved his hand and said: "Don't be polite. I came down to the countryside this time to see the situation and listen to everyone's opinions." Saying this, he asked Village Head Fan to bring some long benches over so everyone could sit in the yard. Everyone said: "We dare not." Only after repeated urging did they sit on the benches. Yun Suji also pulled a long bench and sat down.

Seeing everyone was still somewhat reserved, he smiled and said: "Don't be restrained, everyone. I didn't come here as the Blue Sky Grand Master on a private investigation, nor did I come to 'guide' work. I came here to listen to everyone's thoughts and opinions. Say whatever you have. Don't have any reservations."

Although he said this, the group heads still hemmed and hawed, daring not speak. Those who spoke only said clichés like "Life is good in Hainan, all thanks to the Senate" and "Will never forget the Senate's great kindness." Seeing a few people looking at Fan Twelve, seemingly waiting for him to make a decision, Yun Suji said: "Old Fan, you speak first!"

Fan Twelve had a guilty conscience. He didn't know what Kong Xiaode had said to Chief Yun, nor what those villagers at the field head had said to the Chief just now. He was secretly suspicious when he suddenly heard Yun Suji call his name. He couldn't help but jump in fright and hurriedly stood up saying: "I, I didn't do anything!" Only after speaking did he realize he had let the cat out of the bag, and his face instantly turned beet red.

Yun Suji was secretly amused and said sternly: "You know clearly what you did! First tell me what problems exist in the village's work now."
