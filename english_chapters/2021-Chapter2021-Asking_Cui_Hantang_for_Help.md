# Chapter 2021 - Asking Cui Hantang for Help

For Fang Fei, organizing such an event in the 21st century would be easy: tell the partner the standard cost per guest, and the partner just submits a menu for review. but now Liu Xiang's instructions were vague, even telling him to contact Wang Jun and the others for the budget himself. It was truly a case of wanting the horse to run but not letting it graze.

A celebration without money is nothing more than seeking sponsorship. Now Mayor Liu had completely blocked the path of sponsorship—the twelve designated sponsors sounded like a lot, covering all industries, and were famous names in Guangzhou city. For them to scrape together such a sum wouldn't be difficult—once this "sponsorship" proposal went out, these twelve shops would undoubtedly scramble to send money, probably "giving all they had" to express their determination to "follow the dragon."

But Liu and Lin just had to be pretentious, saying things like "sponsorship amounts shouldn't be too large, precedents are easy to set but hard to retract," "these shops are in a high-growth stage, cash flow is tight, sponsorship should just be a gesture, don't affect their turnover"... These ambiguous words made things very difficult for Fang Fei: exactly how much money should he collect?

After thinking it over, he decided to discuss it with Wang and Du, since this wedding originated from them. See what opinions they had.

"The city government won't let us solicit sponsorship from wealthy households, but those wealthy households naturally won't let go of this great opportunity to 'build connections' with us. I think rather than letting them drill around outside, stuffing silver through dog holes, we might as well open a small hole ourselves..." Du Yibin said.

"Opening a hole ourselves is easy, but what about Mayor Liu?" Fang Fei wasn't afraid of Liu Xiang holding him accountable, but the specific principles were passed at the city government executive meeting. Openly creating a loophole would be tantamount to defying the leadership of Liu Xiang and the Guangzhou Municipal Government.

"Save the nation via a curve," Du Yibin squeezed out an idiom after a long pause. "Find Daoist Cui..."

"We're holding a wedding, not a funeral; why find him?" Fang Fei had a poor impression of Cui Hantang—because he had repeatedly criticized the mass activities and major ceremonies organized by Fang Fei in *Qiming Star* as "a chimera of the Third Reich and old Ivans," failing to "inherit and carry forward traditional Chinese culture," labeling them "foreign slave philosophy" and "dogmatism." Plus, in the old timeline, monks and Daoists were only seen performing rituals at funerals; they had nothing to do with this collective wedding.

"Though a wedding doesn't need a Daoist, don't forget the Executive Vice Chairman of the Guangzhou Wedding and Funeral Council is Daoist Cui." Du Yibin reminded him. "His participation in the wedding as the Executive Vice Chairman of the Wedding and Funeral Council is perfectly legitimate. Make the donation in the name of the Wedding and Funeral Council, nominally saying it's sponsored by Guangzhou's Buddhist, Daoist, and Catholic communities—naturally, where those three get their sponsorships from is none of our business."

"That's feasible." Fang Fei thought it wasn't a bad idea. Except for the New Daoism which had a hint of "official" color, the other groups had little to do with the Council of Elders. If they stepped forward to donate, using the name of the local Wedding and Funeral Council, all sides could be satisfied.

"I'll go talk to Fatty Cui!" Wang Jun volunteered—since he had plenty of leisure time, he often went into the city to Five Immortals Temple to shoot the breeze with Cui Hantang. Cui Hantang, intending to build the Five Immortals Temple into a base for New Daoism, ran quite a few projects of his own and often needed help from Wang Jun, a generalist who "knew a bit of everything" in mechanics, electrical, and electronics. Their relationship was good.

At nightfall, the small square in front of the Five Immortals Temple was as lively as an amusement park. Since Cui Hantang performed the Luotian Dajiao ritual for eighteen days after the public memorial ceremony, exhausting himself into losing fully three jin, Mayor Liu had taken quite good care of him. Not only did New Daoism benefit fully from Guangzhou's religious reforms, but it also received considerable secret support in construction. This small square in front of the Five Immortals Temple was widened for the temple after Mayor Liu "demolished illegal structures." Though not temple property, it was managed and used by the Five Immortals Temple.

Although the Five Immortals Temple was Guangzhou's largest Daoist temple with magnificent halls inside, its actual land area wasn't very large. Generations of construction had long exhausted the land within the temple; Cui Hantang couldn't find a place for outdoor mass activities inside—the largest outdoor open space belonged to the pond where the "Immortal's Footprint" was located.

As for expansion, the Five Immortals Temple was located in Guangzhou's busy market area, with no vacant land on any side. Let alone open space, even the streets were occupied by crowded dilapidated shacks, leaving only a path two or three meters wide. Thanks to Liu Xiang's demolition of illegal structures, the street's old appearance was restored, but expansion was still a no-go—expansion meant demolition and relocation. Cui Hantang dared not mention demolition for temple expansion, and Liu Xiang dared not approve it. Finally, using the fact that many buildings in front of the temple lacked deeds and were thus "illegal structures," they demolished them to clear an open space.

Cui Hantang spent money "compensating" the commoners whose houses were demolished, hired people to level and pave the ground, and fenced the square with wooden palisades—allegedly for "ease of management." He also built flower beds, planted trees, and arranged several benches. It truly cost money and effort, but finally secured this "missionary position."

Having this position, Cui Hantang naturally wanted to make full use of it. Mornings were for organizing Daoist students to practice Tai Chi, daytime open for public rest, and evenings for holding some "propaganda" activities.

These propaganda activities were essentially "proselytizing," but as the square was somewhat of a "public place" and anti-religious sentiment in the Council of Elders was still strong, New Daoism, despite being the Council's own "biological son," remained controversial. After experiencing the power of the Council's various trolls during the Liu Xiang affair previously, Cui Hantang could only keep a relatively low profile with his activities now.

Today's activity, however, was "Australian Shadow Play." Cui Hantang originally intended to present the shadow play as his "magic art," but on second thought, realized Lingao already had movie theaters, and many naturalized citizens had seen it; the deception would easily be exposed. So he dropped that idea. However, the films he chose were as close to the "Daoist" theme as possible.

News of the Australian shadow play had already spread through the streets and alleys. According to people who had seen it in Lingao and Zi Ming Lou, this shadow play was a rare Australian spectacle—much better looking than the "Australian slideshows" on the streets. Everyone wanted to see fresh novelties. Before dark, the square in front of the temple was packed with people. Nearby children rushed over, shouting, running, and jumping; the whole square was a din. Even the newly placed stone Kylins in front of the temple and the surrounding wooden palisades were covered with people. Some wealthy families even had their household servants occupy seats in advance before coming to watch in sedan chairs. Peddlers took the opportunity to sell food and tea, jamming the front of the Five Immortals Temple until not a drop of water could trickle through. There were fully several hundred people. Daoist students from the temple were all mobilized to maintain order on the street and square.

Two pillars were already erected on the square, with a white square cloth curtain with black borders suspended by ropes.

Outside was a tumult of voices eagerly awaiting the start, but inside the temple hall, Cui Hantang lay sprawled on a bamboo couch, chatting idly with Fu Meng—it was still early; films couldn't be shown until the sky was completely dark.

The chat naturally concerned the development of New Daoism in Guangzhou. Although New Daoism had gained much recently—from image to material goods—development still couldn't be called smooth. Occasional suppression by Guangzhou Elders and frequent hostility from the Council of Elders had caused Daoist Cui to lose another half jin.

Although relying on a set of "sleight of hand" tricks and glib tongue to build a "Realized Man" reputation in Guangzhou and approaching/winning over quite a few scholars and gentry, there was no major progress.

His work to develop believers among scholars, especially famous local scholars, wasn't successful. Cui Hantang painfully discovered that no matter how much "divine skill" he revealed or how many "shocking" theories he discussed, these scholars always maintained a barrier against him. Let alone "opening their hearts," even "reverence" was far off. Especially the few scholars he tried hard to win over, hoping for their conversion—almost every one had a tenacious will, not easily fooled by a few words.

Fortunately, activities among the common people and wealthy households were smoother. Many came to worship purely to "build connections" with the Australians. Cui Hantang fished quite a few "offerings" from the worshipping wealthy households, earning much praise from Daoist Zhang for "revenue generation."

"...Old Tang, your trick of showing movies is good, but the wear and tear is unsustainable. Not to mention the controlled projector bulbs, just your laptop—quite a few have broken in Lingao."

Cui Hantang curled his lip: "Those brats play games and watch porn all day; no wonder they break! My little notebook is very precious; I cherish it usually. Using it for another eight or ten years is no problem."

"So what film are we showing? Founding Ceremony or Military Parade?" Fu Meng asked.

"Che, that's why they say you science types have rusty brains! Is that something a Daoist temple can show? Just debug the machine and listen to me; I copied plenty of good stuff on this USB drive." Cui Hantang said haughtily, ignoring Fu Meng's awkward expression.

"No problem, right? Will it leak our origins?" Although Fu Meng was a bit annoyed with him, he still cared about this straightforward fellow villager. Compared to administrative officials full of schemes, he preferred chatting with this charlatan Daoist; it felt relaxed with no pressure at all.

"Don't worry, I've edited them all. Intro and credits removed, producers and studios removed too. Alright, let's go out, it's dark." Cui Hantang said nonchalantly, rising to usher him outside.
