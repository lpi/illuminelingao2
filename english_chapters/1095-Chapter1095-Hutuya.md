# Chapter 1095 - Hutuya

Lü Zeyang's Laizhou dialect dispelled a lot of Fan Twelve's wariness. Seeing that this Lü Family Village "Regiment Commander" was very "sensible" and had the calm composure of a general, Fan Twelve's mood improved slightly. Lü Zeyang knew he had few people and little strength, so he would inevitably need the help of this squad of able-bodied men for many things. Immediately he used some means to win him over. Fan Twelve was just a person mixing on the streets after all, without too much scheming. after a few interactions, the relationship between the two gradually became harmonious.

Fan Twelve said the able-bodied squad of the *Guanxiang* was stationed in several nearby ancestral halls and cemeteries. The government also issued some weapons, but the able-bodied squad hadn't undergone training, so having weapons was useless.

Lü Zeyang comforted him with a few more sentences and called for Acting Company Commander Qian Duo.

Qian Duo enlisted a batch later than Huang Ande. The two had carried guns and stood guard together. Qian Duo's performance in the troops wasn't considered outstanding. He experienced the baptism of the Chengmai Campaign and security warfare. Based on seniority, he also rose to Second Lieutenant. He was originally just a platoon leader. After the Northbound Detachment arrived in Shandong, because there was quite some attrition due to frostbite, the Company Commander of the 3rd Line Infantry Company stayed in Qimu Island due to frostbite on his feet making movement inconvenient. Qian Duo took over as Acting Company Commander.

Although Qian Duo wore a homespun cotton robe, the spirit and energy tempered by long-term military life could not be concealed by this attire.

He walked into the hall with a 75-centimeter step, snapped to attention and saluted: "Acting Company Commander of the 3rd Line Infantry Company, Second Lieutenant Qian Duo reporting to you! Chief, please instruct!"

"At ease!" Lü Zeyang ordered.

The movement of walking in and the crisp actions shocked Fan Twelve—this kid was really spirited!

Fan Twelve saw quite a few incoming village braves and local soldiers in the South *Guanxiang*. Most of them had a dispirited appearance. Rarely were there a few spirited ones.

Not only spirited, but a faint killing aura also emanated from his body—Fan Twelve opened a restaurant outside Laizhou City and had seen quite a few passing soldiers. Soldiers who had been on the battlefield and killed people had a killing aura on them, which was definitely not comparable to the courage of blood and qi of ordinary burly men.

"This is the local *Paijia* Master Fan. Just find him if there is any need!" Lü Zeyang introduced, "Master Fan is the old land god here. We still have to ask him to help more when stationed here."

Fan Twelve hurriedly accompanied with a smiling face: "Duty, duty."

Immediately Fan Twelve and Qian Duo went out to discuss matters of garrison, sentries, and building fortifications—Qian Duo would handle these things one by one. As a Second Lieutenant officer who had undergone three months of intensive 16/7 training in the Training Corps, his ability in this area would only be stronger than the half-assed Senator Lü. After arranging matters at hand, Lü Zeyang immediately took a few warriors of the Special Reconnaissance Team out of the *Guanxiang*, heading towards Haimiao Port in the west of the city, preparing to carry out some preliminary survey work.

His calculation was: if he merely assisted Sun Yuanhua in defending the city, he couldn't reflect his value at all. Only by making greater achievements in the Engine work could he effectively improve the status of himself and the Finance and Economics Department in the Senate. This was the time for him to exert "subjective initiative."

With the development of the war, it was estimated that the next move of both sides would definitely be a tug-of-war centered on Laizhou city defense. The center of rebel ravaging would also shift from near Dengzhou to Laizhou. This was already the generation of later Weifang and western Yantai. If collected refugees walked by land from here to Qimu Island again, it would be inevitably a bit far—the speed of refugees walking by land was too slow. So finding a suitable port near Laizhou as a transfer point became logical.

He planned to use Haimiao Port in the west of the city as a transfer point. This was a famous fishing port in Bohai Bay with superior conditions. In later generations, many Shandong commoners "Braving the Journey to the Northeast" (*Chuang Guandong*) and the Eighth Route Army advancing to the Northeast started from Haimiao. Especially since this place was only 10 kilometers from the prefectural city, land transportation with Laizhou was relatively convenient. Once the war started, there would definitely be a large number of refugees running into the prefectural city protected by city walls for refuge, bringing pressure to city defense work. It was estimated that Sun Yuanhua would vary much wish the Senate to transport these burdens consuming grain away.

"As long as a pier is built here at Haimiao Port, with Laizhou City as bait, won't the population come rolling in? Calculating like this, the credit is huge..." Senator Lü, wrapped in a thick military overcoat riding on a horse, couldn't help wiping his drool thinking of this.

But when he rushed to Haimiao Port to take a look, his heart cooled by half: the sea was frozen.

It served him right to lose Jingzhou due to carelessness. In later generations, Haimiao Port was often reported on CCTV news as a typical example of Bohai Bay winter freezing. In the Great Ming of this Little Ice Age, the freezing situation would only be more serious. Senator Lü only thought of the superiority of Haimiao Port in geographical location and unconsciously ignored this point. Now he had to scratch his ears and cheeks. What to do?

After tossing around Haimiao Port for a round, Senator Lü finally had no charter. Reduced to riding that Mongolian horse borrowed from the cavalry team, he went back resentfully.

On the way back, Lü Zeyang kept calculating how to save his plan. Now Manor Lord Lu in Huang County had sent armed work teams deep into various places of Jiaodong Peninsula, and the work of "picking up people" was in full swing. But his own action here just had the first stroke of the character "eight" (*just started*), yet was ruthlessly snapped by this ghost weather—inevitably leaving a bad impression of "exaggerating" among the big shots inside the Finance and Economics Department. Senator Lü now especially regretted the boast he made to Cheng Dong and Yi Fan at the wine banquet before departure. It seemed this field work was after all not accounting, and he still thought too simply.

Returning to the foothold in the South Pass of the county seat, Lü Zeyang stood in front of the large-scale map of Laizhou Prefecture, comparing the data from the field survey just now, and pondered again.

From the map, besides Haimiao Port, there were two other places in Laizhou that could go out to sea: Sanshandao in the north and Hutuya in the south. In Lü Zeyang's impression: Sanshandao was a port heavily developed by the local government later. He had also been there once or twice. Although the geographical location was closer to the north, it was ice-free in winter due to the influence of ocean currents. The disadvantage was that the straight-line distance to Laizhou prefectural city reached 25 kilometers. Refugees would take two or three days to walk there. The land route was too far, and the sea route was only 20 nautical miles from Qimu Island, which was too close for shipping, making building a temporary pier quite uneconomical. Senator Lü shook his head and swiped the needle of the ranging compass to another candidate location: Hutuya.

Compared to Haimiao Port, the position of Hutuya was more to the south. This was also the terminal point of shipping—along the entire Laizhou Bay coast, only the line from Qimu Island to Hutuya was a sandy and rocky coast suitable for ships to dock. Almost all areas west of Hutuya were mudflats unable to go out to sea. So from an economic perspective, transferring disaster victims from here was the point with maximum profit. However, the existing problem was similar to Haimiao Port: freezing.

"Freezing, freezing..." Lü Zeyang was very annoyed. Turning around, he still circled back to this unsolvable problem. Actually, according to his personal experience, the winter in Shandong Peninsula was not particularly cold. Laizhou rarely had temperatures dropping to minus 5 degrees. One year, to be a hero, he spent the winter without wearing long johns. Now it was already the first lunar month of the fifth year of Chongzhen. If optimistic, the sea might thaw within one or two months. For this period of time, the Senate still had patience.

The problem was that it was the Ming Dynasty now. Climate and hydrological data of Laizhou Bay did not exist. If the situation was the same as his estimate, utilizing this freezing time to build facilities near the port and do preliminary preparation work would be fine. Refugees could be temporarily accommodated in the city—if grain was not enough, ask Qimu Island to support Sun Yuanhua with a batch of grain. Wait until spring warms and flowers bloom, Laizhou City could explode population in large batches.

However, really doing so would involve the issue of refugees leaving the city. In the original historical space-time, the main force of rebel soldiers was stationed under Laizhou City, besieging the city for more than half a year. Although ancient siege battles rarely could truly surround to the point of "not letting water leak through," rebels couldn't possibly fail to see thousands or tens of thousands of people leaving the city to go to the seaside.

However, Lu Wenyuan had talked to him that he would try to solve this matter. As for how to solve it, Lü Zeyang could roughly guess: nine out of ten it was to reach some agreement with the rebel soldiers.

Fan Twelve was arranging people to send door planks to the Wang Family Cemetery to build bunks. Seeing this group of village braves working nimbly on their own things: assigning houses, building bunks, repairing fortifications... No one shirked work, nor did anyone gather together to gossip. Although people came and went constantly between courtyards, there was no extra noise, orderly.

Fan Twelve secretly admired: No wonder this Master Lü was so confident! How were these village braves? They were clearly first-class strong soldiers!

Walking into a courtyard, a strange two-wheeled cart inside was emitting blue smoke—Fan Twelve had seen many carts, but it was the first time seeing a cart with a chimney. He couldn't help but find it very rare. Getting closer to look, there was actually an iron stove on the cart, burning fire and boiling a pot of boiling water. Several cooks were busy aside. Beside the cart were piled many wooden boxes and Chinese cabbages, radishes, and grain bags just delivered.

There were also several baskets of seafood emitting the smell of seawater in the courtyard—probably just got them.

The able-bodied men who came with him to deliver bunk boards also felt it was rare and gathered over to watch the excitement—this stove installed on a cart was truly seen for the first time, too eye-opening.

Seeing them gather over, the cooks didn't stop them either, only not allowing them to get too close, and definitely not allowing them to get close to water buckets and operation tables. These few cooks were all wearing cloth aprons (*Bushen Youdan*), sleeves rolled up high, and there was a strange smell on their arms.

Fan Twelve was looking curiously when suddenly he saw Qian Duo walk in and beckon him over.

"Any orders? Vice Master Qian?"

"Chief, um, Master wants to eat sea intestines (*Urechis unicinctus*) and mackerel dumplings. Heard that you used to be a cook, can you make them?"

"Can, can, these are famous local side dishes," Fan Twelve thought so this Master Lü liked this—although this thing was delicious, few high officials and noble people asked for it—"Poor Man's Joy."
