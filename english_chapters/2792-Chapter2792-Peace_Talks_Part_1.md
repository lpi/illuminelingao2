# Chapter 2792: Peace Talks (Part 1)

Intelligence regarding the Imperial Court's suppression campaign in the Capital began to flow continuously into the Foreign Intelligence Bureau through commercial and foreign intelligence lines. Soon, through the Security Affairs Liaison Conference, most Senators also knew about this situation.

Regarding the Ming Court's suppression campaign, except for those in the military sector, most Senators laughed it off, even feeling it didn't have much to do with them. First, no one believed the Fubo Army would be defeated militarily; second, the current battle line had advanced to the Five Ridges. Let alone Senators in Hainan, even those in Guangzhou couldn't feel much threat from the Great Ming. Guangzhou was not only more prosperous than before but also went up a level in extravagant enjoyment due to the Australian new gadgets and the influx of large numbers of government agencies and enterprises, quite having the meaning of drunken paper and gold fans (luxury and dissipation).

But for the army and intelligence/security agencies (Qingzhi), duty-bound, naturally they couldn't laugh it off. They were about to enter "combat readiness" immediately.

Combat readiness of the army had thousands of threads and loose ends, but combat readiness of intelligence units was much simpler, nothing more than knowing "what" the Emperor planned to do and "how" to do it.

Judging from the sent intelligence, the Great Ming was indeed proceeding with preparations for an offensive. Its offensive intention could even be said to be undisguised. In this space-time, the concept of strategic deception was still very vague, and actual operation was also difficult to achieve watertight secrecy. So Jiang Shan believed this matter was nailed on the iron board (certain), without dispute.

The following "how to do it" was the key point. Strictly speaking, how the Great Ming would suppress was not the key work object of intelligence agencies. In the 17th century, the routes to attack Guangdong and Guangxi from the south were just those few. The Ming army also had no capability for amphibious landing or airborne operations. The General Staff didn't need to spend much effort to analyze the Ming army's possible marching routes and combat plans. The things intelligence agencies needed to do were limited.

What really interested intelligence agencies was that among the information coming from various channels, some special information was mixed in. That was, did the Great Ming really want to "go south," or rather, what was the true purpose of the Great Ming going south?

As long as they were not Ming officials who spoke lies with eyes open, everyone knew the winning rate of going south to punish Kun was not higher than recovering Shenyang and eliminating Manchus. It could even be said that eliminating Manchus could still be strived for somewhat after all; Hong Taiji and his pillaging group also had a hard time. Fighting a war of attrition and delay was beneficial to the Great Ming. But to drive away Australians, it was already an impossible thing.

Rashly launching a punitive expedition with almost no chance of winning was very unfavorable to the Great Ming from a strategic level.

Senators could see it; could the people of insight in the Great Ming not see it? Did they have any secret weapons?

"Secret weapons naturally don't exist, but generally speaking, the drinker's heart is not in the cup (ulterior motive)." Xu Ke said.

He was not in the conference room of the Foreign Intelligence Bureau at this moment, but in a conference room of the Internal Security Affairs Bureau. The weekly Internal Security Conference was being held here.

Since the establishment of the Foreign Intelligence Bureau, under Jiang Shan's suggestion, all intelligence/security agencies under the Senate would hold such a meeting every week to exchange intelligence and communicate. In order to analyze and utilize intelligence effectively, and also be able to borrow resources from other departments at any time.

Because this system operated effectively, it had continued down.

At this moment, the conference room was full of people. The "Four Great Guardians"—Foreign Intelligence Bureau, Reconnaissance General Bureau, Political Security Bureau, and National Police—were all there, plus the General Guard Bureau established not long ago. according to custom, someone from the commercial department also attended the meeting.

"Where does it lie then?"

"Lies in the face of the Imperial Court." Wang Ding laughed. "Punishing Kun is Chongzhen's behavior to maintain face. We have analyzed this problem at the beginning. The Imperial Court cannot turn a blind eye to our action of capturing Guangdong and Guangxi. Great Ming has two Capitals and thirteen Administration Commissioners; we took away two easily. The Court's face is swept to the ground (disgraced). If there is no action, will anyone take this Court seriously? Even if it will fail, this battle must be fought—this is an attitude problem."

"Wouldn't failing lose more face?"

"Can fight a lost battle, but cannot admit defeat." Li Yan said, "Everyone understands this logic."

Jiang Shan smiled and said: "Things are not that simple." He cleared his throat, "integrating intelligence from all aspects, we believe the Great Ming Court is preparing for peace talks."

A slight ripple rose in the conference room. Those present were all staff of intelligence/security units, all too familiar with mutual deception, honey dripping from mouth but sword in belly, making a feint to the east but attacking in the west... these routines. But the word "peace talks" still aroused their great interest.

Were peace talks good? Good. Both the Ming Court and the Senate had the intention of peace talks. One wanted to use it to gain a breathing spell to concentrate strength on dealing with Later Jin and peasant armies; the other naturally was practicing the strategy of "build walls high, accumulate grain widely," easing the external environment to strive for development space, and could also conduct infiltration through trade. The purposes of both sides were to strive for more combat preparation time.

But international relations in East Asia in the 17th century were the suzerain-vassal tributary system. The Central Plains regime of China became the unified center, and various tributary states acknowledged this central status, constituting the outer vassals of the central regime. What suzerain-vassal relations contained was not just international relations; the foundation of this relationship was the Hua-Yi (Chinese-Barbarian) Order. Regarding China as "Hua" (Civilized), and surrounding countries as "Yi" (Barbarian).

The nominal issue became an insurmountable obstacle.

Letting the Senate acknowledge the Ming Dynasty as suzerain, this was impossible.

Letting the Ming Dynasty accept the Senate having equal status with it, the Ming Dynasty couldn't accept it either.

The situation of the Portuguese in Macau was special. Strictly speaking, Macau was just them Borrowing residence as guests; the Ming government office had always existed.

In the eyes of the Emperor and ministers, they could accept the claim that Kun Thieves were descendants of Huaxia, but at the same time, in their view, Kun Thieves had lived overseas for a long time, not knowing the etiquette of the Celestial Dynasty, and were already no different from overseas barbarians. To let Ming Dynasty sit as equals with this political entity heavily violated the political correctness of the Ming Dynasty.

Of course, it wasn't completely hopeless. After all, the Senate was still different from the Manchus. Since 1618, the Manchus had battled for nearly twenty years, with hundreds of thousands of Ming troops dead and injured, and Liaodong people massacred counting in millions. Several entries into the Pass for pillage caused even greater destruction, with countless military and civilian casualties near the Capital.

While the Kun Thieves just occupied Guangdong and Guangxi. The Ming troops eliminated on the battlefield were only tens of thousands. They didn't manufacture sensational massacres, nor did they pillage and sweep near the Capital.

Besides, they claimed to be descendants of the Song Dynasty; emotionally it was easier to accept.

But how to operate specifically, using what excuse to negotiate peace, this was a big difficult problem.

Especially Great Ming, which always "ceded no land, paid no indemnities, made no marriage alliances," even if the Emperor was captured, they would continue to fight against it. let alone the Court hadn't reached the time of critical survival yet.

So as soon as Jiang Shan's conclusion came out, everyone was somewhat skeptical more or less.

"First say why we judge so," Jiang Shan picked up a report in his hand, "This is our judgment report on the court situation in the Capital in the recent half year. Content is a lot, I won't list one by one. Everyone can read slowly after going back. Just mentioning a few important places."

"First is Yang Sichang's memorials and records of answering questions (Zhao Dui). The original text excerpts and related translations have appendices in the report. Generally speaking, his 'pacification' train of thought is exactly the same as in history. All take peasant armies as the main strike target, that is, 'to resist foreign aggression, one must first settle internal stability' is the guiding ideology of this future Minister of War. His thinking, whether in history or now, is fully approved by Chongzhen. If you look carefully, Yang Sichang said quite a few good words for us in the records of answering questions. And the Emperor seemed to approve quite a bit.

"Secondly, it's the collection of Guangdong Provisions (Yue Xiang)." Jiang Shan said, "This matter fully illustrates the current mentality of the Court. Yue Xiang is like Liao Xiang (Liaodong Provisions), collected to deal with external enemies. Theoretically, funds are earmarked for specific purposes—at least Liao Xiang is like this. But everyone can see the relevant memorials of the Ministry of Revenue: the quota of Yue Xiang is 2.1 million. Before collecting it, 1 million is already reserved for 'suppressing bandits.' Fu Zonglong has a high probability of not getting even one-third of the remaining 1.1 million taels—yet the Court wants him to 'train troops and make weapons'."

"Third, Fu Zonglong's comeback, the obtained position is Governor of Southern Jiangxi (Nan-Gan). Although also a high ranking regional military and political official, compared to corresponding high officials in Liaodong and the interior with added titles of Premier, Viceroy, Strategy-Manager, Fu Zonglong is merely a Governor. It's hard to imagine how he should coordinate various armies to launch a large-scale southern punitive expedition."

"You mean punishing Kun is just a cover?" Ran Yao questioned, "But this can't prove Great Ming will negotiate peace with us."

"Perhaps more to give an excuse for peace talks..."

"Negotiate peace after fighting a lost battle? Great Ming is not like this. Even when the Emperor was captured at Tumu Crisis, they didn't negotiate peace."

"I'm afraid this is very possible." Xu Ke said, "According to my harvest from this trip to the Capital, peace talks in the court are already undercurrents surging. This is actually very attractive to the Emperor. The benefits peace talks can bring to Great Ming are obvious..."

"Since there are benefits, why not negotiate peace? The initiative is in their hands!"

"This is the Court's face mentioned earlier." Xu Ke continued, "Perhaps it should be said Chongzhen's face. Everyone has listened to Teacher Yu's lecture, probably having a certain understanding of this person Chongzhen's character and conduct. He very much hopes to become a wise ruler and sage, unwilling to have any flaw. So for him to open this opening of peace talks, high probability it won't work."

Those at the meeting nodded together. They had all heard Yu E'shui talk about the "Chen Xinjia Incident."

"So he hopes someone in the court takes the lead to propose this suggestion. For this matter, he actually has hinted to Wen Tiren for several months, but Wen Tiren just doesn't take his hint."

"Right, Chen Xinjia being unclear (muddled) doesn't mean Wen Tiren is unclear." Someone laughed.

"Whether he is unclear or not, we have no way to know. But our view is, Wen Tiren didn't take this matter to heart. His entire mind now is placed on overthrowing Qian Qianyi and bring down the Restoration Society."
 
Wen Tiren being "unclear" didn't mean others were "unclear." After all, the "Chen Xinjia Incident" hadn't appeared yet, and officials hadn't lost trust in the Emperor yet. So people who wanted to take the opportunity to cater to the Sacred Will were already itching to try.
