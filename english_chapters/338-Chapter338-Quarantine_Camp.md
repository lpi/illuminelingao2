# Chapter 338 - Quarantine Camp

Xiao Zishan also promised that he and the General Office staff would come to teach when they had free time. At the same time, he had another matter that was urgent but not too urgent.

"What do you think should be done about the Children's Primary School?" Xiao Zishan asked.

The so-called Children's Primary School referred to the education problem of the minor children brought by the transmigrators. Currently, there were not many minor children of the transmigrators themselves, only three or four, basically all under ten years old. They hadn't received any school education for more than half a year, playing freely in the vast world every day. Moreover, every child's parents were very busy and could hardly supervise their studies and life.

Although the matter was small and didn't involve a large scope, it was after all within the responsibility of the General Office. Xiao Zishan felt this matter was tricky: the young age of the children required dedicated personnel to care for and educate them. Their number was too small to set up a separate educational institution like the Yuhong School for them. After all, most transmigrators didn't even have wives, and the first baby boom hadn't arrived yet. To run such a school would be a matter for at least eight or ten years later.

He told these considerations to Hu Qingbai and Bai Yu: "How can we satisfy everyone?"

"In the long run, institutions like Yuhong School must be established. At least a nursery level will be needed within two or three years." Hu Qingbai said, "For now, just set up a dedicated class in the Education Park temporarily." Hu Qingbai thought for a moment, "A general subject class. I'll teach it myself. However, it's best to allocate a female teacher to me. The children are generally young; a female teacher has more affinity."

"Let Fang Yijing do it. She has worked in a kindergarten."

"That's best." Hu Qingbai stated his idea: "We'll have classes for half a day every day, adopting multi-grade education. I'll also select a few indigenous children with gentle personalities and good Mandarin to be study companions."

"This plan is good." Xiao Zishan said, "I originally wanted to do this too, but felt there were too few children in the class."

"Indigenous children are not bad either; there are many smart and lively ones."

"Let me look over these children first when the time comes." Xiao Zishan thought for a moment, "It's best to ask the Ministry of Health to give them a thorough physical examination beforehand. Must be completely healthy. By the way, appearance should also be relatively good."

"Fine, no problem." Hu Qingbai secretly laughed at how trivial the matters this Director managed were.

After seeing off the "Imperial Envoy," Hu Qingbai said to Bai Yu: "Go find Wu De, inform him about the recruitment for the Simplified Normal School, and ask him to help coordinate—after all, the natives are all under his management; he knows best who is suitable and who is not."

Bai Yu nodded: "This is naturally expected."

Bai Yu found Wu De and repeated the request to him. Wu De nodded: "Simplified Normal School is a good method, but finding so many school-age girls might be difficult."

Wu De introduced the current refugee intake situation. By May 1629, they had taken in over six thousand refugees through the Guangzhou Station channel. Among them, more than four thousand had been transported to Lingao and settled in the Bairen Commune. Five hundred were settled in Leizhou, and over a thousand were still kept in Guangzhou.

Wu De said: "Many people have been transported, but the ages of those taken in are uneven. You ask for three hundred and fifty girls aged fifteen to twenty in one breath; where am I supposed to find them for you?"

"I thought there were many women..." Bai Yu muttered, "Didn't ancients consider girls as money-losing goods?"

"But they were also keen on snatching and buying women. These refugees wandered all the way to Guangzhou; the possibility of young girls being sold or snatched on the road is too high."

"Just give however many you can."

"One hundred and twenty, at most. Still have to give forty to the Ministry of Health." Wu De checked the computer and said.

"The Ministry of Health wants so many?!"

"In my opinion, getting forty is still too few for the Ministry of Health. Right now there aren't enough people dispensing disinfectant in the camps." Wu De sent Bai Yu away.

"Humph, all coming to me to ask for girls; don't think I don't know what you are thinking!" Wu De whispered. Then he called out: "Chu Yu!"

"Coming!" Chu Yu had changed her attire now; her hair was cut short, and her clothes changed to modern ones. Plus having "first tasted the rain and dew" (lost virginity/become a woman), her figure and face had filled out, looking very different from that little servant girl of the past.

"Call Dugu Qiuhun, notify him to go to the Quarantine Camp together."

Wu De, the People's Commissar for Civil Affairs, sat high in the first tier of the Executive Committee's power system for no other reason than his work being the heaviest and most crucial. No matter how brilliant the technology and industry, or how much money, nothing could be done without people to work. And Wu De controlled the entire human resources of the Transmigration Group.

Dugu Qiuhun appeared in his office wearing an old-style iron-grey shirt of the Model 99 police uniform, with East German People's Army summer service breeches on his lower body, and wearing high boots—the SS M32 uniform replica he brought could not be worn in Lingao no matter what, so he had to settle for second best. After all, this outfit looked "Iron and Blood" enough.

"Let's go, let's go inspect the Quarantine Camp."

This was a daily routine. No matter how busy his work was, Wu De would go inspect the Quarantine Camp with supervisors from the force department and the health department. There were about a thousand people gathered in the camp at all times; a mass incident or a plague outbreak would be no joke.

When the car arrived at Bopu, He Ma (Hippo), sent by the Ministry of Health, also arrived. The three came to the heavily guarded Quarantine Camp. An infantry company trained in riot control was stationed here; besides rifles and grenades, they were also equipped with rattan armor, rattan shields, wooden sticks, and tear gas.

Currently, except for a few group fights over eating and bathing issues, no major disturbances had occurred. To prevent bringing regional conflicts, host-guest conflicts, and clan conflicts into Lingao during the immigration process, Wu De explicitly raised several key points in the guide telegraphed to Guangzhou for taking in refugees: only take in orphans, single men and women, and single-household small families. Those migrating and wandering as clans or large families were rejected without exception—before the Transmigration Group cultivated enough reliable administrative cadres and a powerful violent machine, the Executive Committee didn't want to consume too much energy solving civil disputes. After all, the local clan problems in Lingao were already severe enough. Introducing foreign large clans would simply be asking for trouble.

Once refugees were taken in, they had to sign a contract to become indentured servants, losing personal freedom. Since their status was servants, they were the master's property. Legally, their relationship with their original families was severed. After being "purified" locally and settled in the quarantine camp, they became slaves with neither past nor personal freedom. Even things to recall didn't exist anymore. They were left to the Transmigration Group to transform into the human resources needed.

Surrounded by a squad of people, Wu De walked into this quarantine camp. Somehow, every time he walked into this camp area, he remembered *Escape from Sobibor* he watched back then. Although this association was extremely inappropriate, the long strip barracks, the surrounding barbed wire, the tall watchtowers, the sentries with live ammunition, and the fearful expressions on the refugees' faces when seeing their group walk past, were all very similar.

The refugees in the camp had been drilled very well by the Army. Whether it was "Attention!" when entering, "Dismissed!" when leaving, or the neatly folded quilts and clean straw mats in the barracks—even in the women's camp, it was no inferior—reflected the Army's super strong ability in this aspect.

When Dugu Qiuhun walked past, his black high boots and breeches caused many to show expressions of fear—he was practically the symbol of terror in the quarantine camp. Many refugees couldn't forget his appearance every time he came to the camp to judge troublemakers who violated discipline: a young man looking like a pale-faced scholar, with a serene smile at the corner of his mouth, a small gesture would cause some unlucky guy to be dragged onto the rack at the main gate and beaten until his flesh tore open.

Wu De adopted a "Grace and Power" approach towards the collected refugees. Letting them eat their fill, have clothes to wear, have diseases treated, and families reunited. But "Power" also had to be sufficient, letting the immigrants truly realize who the master here was. Purely bestowing favors would instead make people indulgent. Strict disciplinary control was implemented here. People who followed rules wouldn't suffer; conversely, they would be fixed miserably. What awaited repeat offenders was hard labor.

This policy was very effective. According to feedback from various economic departments accepting immigrant workers, the immigrants' performance was commendable: obedient, working hard, with strong organization and discipline.

This also made the specific executor, Dugu Qiuhun, quite isolated within the Transmigration Group. Although most people in the Transmigration Group were pragmatists, quite a few also held "universal values" ideas. Plus Dugu Qiuhun's usually quite ostentatious attire inevitably incurred dislike; some even questioned on the BBS whether Dugu Qiuhun's conduct in the quarantine camp was suspected of fascism.

Under such an awkward and subtle situation, Dugu Qiuhun fulfilled his responsibilities. To avoid letting him continue roasting on the fire pit, Wu De removed his concurrent post as Quarantine Camp Commander and replaced him with Yang He.

Yang He belonged to the Otaku crowd with extremely firm stances but no expertise other than online games. Being the commander of this quarantine camp was just right. He had been a guild leader or high-ranking cadre in several small guilds in online games and had some insights into managing groups. More importantly, he executed all of Wu De's instructions without question. This way, Dugu Qiuhun's purge activities inside the camp were still unimpeded.

"How are the emotional trends today?" Wu De asked Yang He.

"Very stable, Blue Mood Standard."

"Blue every day; don't treat it as just coping with a chore." Wu De knew Yang He hadn't graduated from university long ago and lacked social experience, which was what he was relatively worried about.
