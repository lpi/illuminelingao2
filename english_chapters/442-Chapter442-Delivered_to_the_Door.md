# Chapter 442 Delivered to the Door

Finally, it was proven that it used the *Thousand Character Classic* as a substitution code. Each character corresponded to a common Chinese character. Gou Er must have carried a special version of the *Thousand Character Classic* with him as a decoding book.

"Can you decipher it?"

"Of course I can," Zhang Xingpei said with certainty. "But there are several prerequisites. We need someone proficient in Ming dynasty Chinese to know the linguistic habits of people at that time, so we can calculate character frequency in a ciphertext. We also need enough ciphertext for reference. The more ciphertext, the easier it is to cross-reference character usage frequency..."

"All the ciphertext right now is just these names," Mu Min said. "I'm afraid it will be very difficult."

"In that case, it is indeed very difficult." Zhang Xingpei's attitude suddenly became pessimistic. With only names and no coherent sentences, there was no way to verify the accuracy of the decryption through context.

"I'll try again," Zhang Xingpei said. "But I can't say when there will be results."

"Alright. Just get as many names as you can." Lin Baiguang was helpless; this was the only way.

However, based on the known names and information deduced from the file contents, they mastered a batch of names in Lingao and successfully learned what they had done in collusion with Gou Da and Gou Er. This information greatly spirited Lin Baiguang—it added weight to their "Ming Skin, Australian Heart" plan scheduled to start in the autumn.

The so-called "Ming Skin, Australian Heart" meant taking advantage of the upcoming autumn tax collection to infiltrate the county yamen. They would purge lower-level clerks and replace them with their own people, thereby controlling specific county administration and completely sidelining Wu Mingjin and others.

After gaining actual control of the county yamen, they would use the big signboard of the county yamen to implement the Crossing Group's policies ostentatiously. Cao Cao "held the Emperor hostage to command the feudal lords"; the Crossing Group would "hold the Magistrate hostage to command the county people." The scale was different, but the logic was the same. This was the Executive Committee's wishful thinking.

The appeasement of the county yamen staff and the winning over of local intellectuals were precisely to pave the way for this plan, serving to paralyze local resistance and reduce groups that might cause confrontation.

But these were just carrots; the necessary stick also had to be prepared. Gathering "black materials" was the most effective stick. It could not only knock people dizzy but also ruin their reputations. In an ancient society that still relatively "knew shame," this effect was much more effective than in the modern space-time.

The Social Work Department of the Political Security Bureau had been collecting black materials for several months. The sources were diverse: collected from locals by social survey work teams, learned from interrogating prisoners, and naturally, many anonymous whistleblowing materials secretly sent in—many people placed their hopes for personal revenge on the Crossing Group.

There were also non-anonymous ones. For example, Zhang Youfu, that down-and-out household, was simply an expert at gathering black materials. It could be said that besides the Gou brothers, his ass was the dirtiest in the whole county, but he was extremely specialized in snitching. During the consultative conference, he had secretly sent Xi Yazhou several pieces of black material on Liu Dalin. These materials were transferred by Xi Yazhou to the Political Security Bureau. Ran Yao looked at them; they were almost entirely Liu Dalin's cursing remarks against the Crossing Group and his past deeds of actively scheming to attack the Crossing Group.

Then he provided a list of gentry who had participated in the attack on the Crossing Group, along with their remarks and deeds. Although Ran Yao despised the person after reading it, he had to admit this man was a "talent." So Zhang Youfu became one of the guest agents of the Security Bureau.

After several months, the black materials collected were truly numerous. From major things like colluding with bandits and pirates, driving tenant farmers to death, and raping bondmaids, to minor things like secretly slaughtering draft cattle, incest with daughters-in-law, and seducing widows. There were all sorts of things categorized. Ran Yao filed them all by name regardless of truthfulness.

The reason Lin Baiguang was so interested in the seized black ledgers of Gou Er was that besides wanting to know the Gou family's network in Qiongzhou Prefecture, increasing the weight of black materials was also his goal—the limelight couldn't just be hogged by the Social Work Department.

Lin Baiguang reported the materials in hand to Ran Yao. The next day, Xiong Buyou received an instruction: go to the county yamen immediately to handle a matter.

Xiong Buyou went to see Wang Zhaomin as per routine. To get things done with the Magistrate, seeing his private secretary was the fastest and most effective way. Because officials had many things they couldn't say outright, making specific bargaining difficult, it was more convenient for the private secretary to handle it.

Wang Zhaomin could refuse to see others, but "Master Xiong" had to be seen. He hurriedly ordered someone to invite him in. He muttered to himself: *The monthly stipend was just delivered. Master Xiong visiting suddenly, I wonder what for.*

The matter wasn't big. It was requesting the county yamen to issue an official document: declaring that Gou Da and Gou Er colluded with pirates and that the former "sea bandits fought among themselves, killing everyone in the manor." This wasn't difficult. Although the county yamen hadn't formally issued a document, it had been handled internally this way. Wang Zhaomin thought, *These Bandit Chiefs also understand some reason now. They know "if names are not correct, language is not in accordance with the truth," and want to use the Great Ming's legal authority to legitimize themselves.*

Thinking of this, he couldn't help but secretly rejoice. *As long as you acknowledge the authority of the Great Ming government and want to use the two signboards of Lingao County Yamen and Wu Mingjin, we can discuss terms.* He still didn't know the Crossing Group's idea of replacing them.

Second was requesting the county yamen to write to the Guangdong Education Commissioner to revoke Gou Er's son Gou Chengxuan's *shengyuan* degree on the same charges. At the same time, issue sea arrest warrants in the county to pursuit and capture Gou Er and his son.

Wang Zhaomin pondered for a moment. These three things weren't hard to say. Except for writing to the Guangdong Education Commissioner being slightly troublesome—and just slightly troublesome; the Commissioner certainly wouldn't refuse. The other two matters were effortless. He just had to think carefully about what medicine the Australians were selling in their gourd.

A few days ago, he had heard that the Australians suddenly went to Gou Er's residence and made a big commotion. Afterward, when the runners went to reseal the door, they found the well in the backyard had been pumped dry—did Gou Er hide something in the well? Otherwise, why would the Australians pump the well dry?

Wang Zhaomin couldn't guess. For the Crossing Group, they were almost transparent in one direction: the Australians knew whatever happened in the county, but he was completely in the dark about what the Australians were doing. Let alone guessing their specific intentions. Wang Zhaomin came from a "secretary" background; he had miscellaneous learning in his belly and was proficient in officialdom knowledge. But the Australians' knowledge system was completely different from his, and even their thinking was widely divergent, making it hard for him to speculate.

"This is easy." Wang Zhaomin agreed very readily. There was one thing he had figured out clearly: the Australians liked to be direct. Just mention requests directly; they hated insinuating hints the most. "Issuing a proclamation is done. But for the Guangdong Education Commissioner's side, customarily there needs to be some embellishment."

"This is easy." Xiong Buyou laughed inwardly seeing him open his mouth to talk money. "Approximately how much?"

"Fifty taels is enough." Wang Zhaomin knew this matter actually had little to do with the Commissioner himself; it was handled by the Commissioner's private secretary. Plus fees for the clerks below, forty taels of silver was sufficient. Ten taels would count as his own benefit.

Of course, these ten taels weren't taken for free. Revoking a *xiucai* degree was absolutely no small matter in the Ming and Qing eras, even more serious than expelling someone from the Party today. But it wasn't impossible to do—Ming and Qing could be considered a "procedurally legal" society. Regardless of whether it was reasonable, the key was that it had to withstand scrutiny in official matters. The official document had to be written flawlessly. Spending some silver on top of that, naturally, it would be done. Wang Zhaomin was somewhat self-satisfied—in this moment, he had already drafted the manuscript in his belly.

"The necessary expenses will be presented together another day." Xiong Buyou nodded. Saying this, he was about to rise and take his leave.

"Wait," Wang Zhaomin stopped him. "Master Xiong, please stay. I have a matter to inquire about."

"Yes." Xiong Buyou stopped to see what he had to say.

Wang Zhaomin hesitated. He had discussed this matter with Wu Mingjin for a long time. After much thought, there was no other way, but it was hard to say if the other party had this interest.

"I heard the Noble Group is reclaiming wasteland and farming in Meitai Yang..."

"True, that is happening." Xiong Buyou admitted openly.

"Meitai Yang is extremely difficult to farm," Wang Zhaomin said. "Presumably the Noble Group has Australian secret methods available. Bountiful harvests shouldn't be difficult."

Xiong Buyou smiled reservedly. The Crossing Group's agricultural level was known to all in Lingao and was also their most attractive skill.

"...It's just that Meitai Yang also has autumn taxes for other farmlands. We ask the Noble Group to pay the full amount." Wang Zhaomin finally revealed his true intention.

Xiong Buyou suddenly realized. So they were aiming at the autumn grain tax.

This calculation was really shrewd. Indeed, officials only pretended to be confused; there were no truly confused ones. Of course, Wu Mingjin and Wang Zhaomin being so interested in the Crossing Group's land was also somewhat out of necessity—originally, they didn't want to deal with this group of Australians, but the situation they faced left them no choice.

Collecting "Imperial grain and national tax" was the most critical matter for ancient grassroots government departments, the priority among priorities. In terms of Lingao's tax burden, it was hard to say it was unbearably heavy. Summer grain was negligible. The main event, autumn grain, was only 7,686 *shi*, 7 *sheng*, and 9 *he*. Even with Lingao's currently low productivity level, it was affordable.

The biggest problem lay in the surcharges (*jiapai*). Liao Supplies had already been surcharged three times, levying 9 *li* per *mu*. Of course, at this time, neither Wu Mingjin nor Wang Zhaomin knew that next year—the third year of Chongzhen—there would be another surcharge, becoming 1 *qian* 2 *li* per *mu*.

This figure wasn't difficult for relatively affluent areas with wide silver circulation—like the Southern Zhili area. But for a remote small county like Lingao where the natural economy dominated, it appeared difficult.
