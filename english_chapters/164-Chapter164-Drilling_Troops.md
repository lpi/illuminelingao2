# Chapter 164: Drilling Troops

Military-Political School cadet squad's days resembled quarantine—regimented. Rising 5am with Training Battalion soldiers for running. Training Battalion did 5km cross-country; they circled the training grounds ten times.

Mornings were study—continuing quarantine camp learning: literacy and arithmetic. Unlike quarantine where Salt Village "fake baldies" taught—now "real baldies" instructed. Children learned others' term for Australian masters: "Chiefs."

"Chiefs'" classes were more interesting than simple literacy and arithmetic. Someone taught reading a shiny small disc with Arabic numerals from arithmetic class and two constantly-ticking moving needles. Per the instructor "Chief," this was a "clock"—for timekeeping. Just looking told exact time. Far more convenient and accurate than incense clocks, water clocks, sundials.

"This must be treasure—even our village's Huang Master doesn't have one! He's the county's top gentry!"

"What's your Huang Master?" The instructing "Chief" dismissively pursed his lips. "Even Beijing's Imperial Palace has none."

"Then it's priceless treasure? Tribute to Emperor—Chiefs could become high officials!"

Xiao Zishan smiled helplessly. Commoners' words reflected simplest understanding: good things belonged to the Emperor. Centuries of Chinese dynasties plundered the best things from ruled subjects for one surname's enjoyment. Anything labelled "tribute" guaranteed quality.

"Clocks' purpose is precise time control." Xiao Zishan redirected. "Before, people only knew approximate time from sun position, night watches, drum towers, noon cannons. With clocks—know exact time anytime. Know how much time any task took."

"What's the use?" Someone asked. "When I herded landlord's cattle—went all day. Left at dawn, returned before dark. That's it."

"Just learn clock-reading for now. Uses—you'll naturally understand later."

Xiao Zishan knew explaining to 400-year-ago youth was difficult. Except astronomical and calendar specialists, traditional agriculture rarely needed precise time. Precise timing was modern science's requirement.

This phase was "general education." Rather than complex advanced science, quickly adapting newcomers to transmigrator units, terminology, and habits was more important. Only barrier-free communication enabled effective command.

Afternoons were drill—like recruits. Main focus: formation training. With 40 days' quarantine Mandarin, they understood instructor commands. Though some still confused left and right, being pulled out for beatings for incomprehension was rarer.

Evenings like recruits—political education, repeated indoctrination, plus extra knowledge.

Compared to regular recruits, their classes were heavier—recruits only had evening and bad-weather literacy and arithmetic. Ma Qianzhu had high expectations—but decided against excessive special treatment for now. Let them temper in Training Battalion's collective—observe who'd become future backbone.

Tian Liang struggled. Already not clever—quarantine beatings for bad grades. Now even harder. Final specialty exams—landed in infantry track. The Ruan brothers' excellent grades got them into artillery track. One day a blue-uniformed "Chief" came—upon learning the Ruan brothers were fishermen's sons, they became "Navy"—roughly "water forces."

Afterwards—branches split. The Ruan brothers now studied artillery firing tables and various shooting methods, every morning pushing cannons around, drilling gun operations endlessly. Funniest: learning to harness limbers. Cannons and limbers attached via specialized leather straps to draft horses. Small guns needed one horse; the largest needed eight. For horse familiarity, artillerymen periodically visited the Farm for stable duty. Afternoons: slide rules, compasses, surveying equipment.

Tian Liang practiced shouldering wood guns, donning rattan armor for bayonet drill, squad formation changes, trench digging, earthwork building, wall construction.

Every few days, instructors led field marches—constantly training against hypothetical targets. Sometimes short-distance charges—running fast while stabbing enemies upon reaching positions.

Worst: forced marches. Everyone carrying dozens of kilograms—small trotting 15km on mountain paths or paddy dikes—arriving within time limits, immediately fortifying, then splitting into opposing teams. Combat drills included shooting—using wood guns. These weren't weighted sticks anymore—iron-weighted training rifles. Everything except shooting: barrels, touch holes, bayonet mounts—complete. Simulated shooting required full muzzle-loader procedures: bite cartridge, load, cap—nothing skipped. Instructors criticized non-standard movements. After shooting—bayonet and hand-to-hand combat. Combat continued until one side expelled the other. Losers handled bivouac construction and cooking. Sometimes training became real fighting—bloody noses, cracked skulls, broken bones common.

Then field-medic trainee nurses proved useful—casualties became their practice specimens. Those "Technical School" girls all became Medical Group nursing students. Shi Niaoren planned training some as qualified doctors—secretly teaching several clever girls a strange language: Latin.

These trainee nurses had little equipment or medication. Their regulation Red Cross med kits—though 400-year-future latest models—were basically empty. Besides alcohol, cotton, splints, suture needles, and simple Chinese medicines—nothing useful. All modern drugs were personally controlled by Medical Group doctors. Fortunately, survivors to teenage years were Darwinian victors. Decent constitution. Simple treatment plus rest recovered.

One exercise—Tian Liang spotted Guo Fu. She wore the same clothing—but hair was growing out, wearing a brimless soft cap. Armband with strange embroidery: blue snake coiled on stick—every "nurse's" insignia.

That exercise—Tian Liang fought especially hard, hoping for a minor wound to see Guo Fu and chat. But his exceptional valor sent opponents to the infirmary—himself unharmed. Could only frustratedly watch Guo Fu from a distance.

Once adapted to training, instructors added night-assembly tricks. Deep sleep suddenly interrupted—emergency assembly—ten minutes without full equipment meant ten-lap penalty. That was manageable. Worst: night marches. Everyone with white cloth strip on back—single-file night marching.

Ancient armies rarely night-fought. First: ancient communications couldn't control night-marching directions—let alone combat. Second: without proper maps, even daytime navigation was problematic without guides—nighttime impossible.

Precisely because ancient armies avoided night combat, transmigrators trained for it. For the numerically inferior but training-superior New Army, night fighting effectively negated enemy numbers.

Night training wasn't just marching. Squad-level tactical movement in darkness—coordinating entirely via whistles, fifes, bugles. Necessary cases used signal rockets. Red Army and Eighth Route had no walkie-talkies—still dominated night battles.

Then wilderness survival. Bei Wei's training syllabus originally covered tropical/subtropical through snowy north. But considering no northeast development for 2–3 years, focus was local and South China. Slide projectors proved invaluable—especially plant and animal identification. First pictures, then field observation. Then: compass use, wilderness direction-finding, weather prediction, shelter construction, first aid... Finally soldiers in squad units were sent into mountains for 10 days—completing various tasks. Each could bring: one dagger, one-*jin* raw rice, some salt. To prevent trainees harassing civilians during wilderness training, Bei Wei's special team monitored—simultaneously training themselves.
