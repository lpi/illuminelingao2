# Chapter 164: Drilling Troops

The days of the Military-Political School's cadet squad resembled their time in quarantine—they were highly regimented. They rose at 5 a.m. along with the Training Battalion soldiers for running. While the Training Battalion did a 5km cross-country run, the cadets circled the training grounds ten times.

Mornings were for study, continuing the learning from the quarantine camp: literacy and arithmetic. Unlike the quarantine camp, where the Salt Village "fake baldies" taught, now the "real baldies" instructed them. The children learned the term others used for the Australian masters: "Chiefs."

The "Chiefs'" classes were more interesting than simple literacy and arithmetic. Someone taught them to read a shiny small disc featuring the Arabic numerals from arithmetic class and two constantly ticking moving needles. According to the instructor "Chief," this was a "clock" used for timekeeping. Just looking at it told the exact time. It was far more convenient and accurate than incense clocks, water clocks, and sundials.

"This must be a treasure—even our village's Master Huang doesn't have one! He's the county's top gentry!"

"What's your Master Huang?" The instructing "Chief" dismissively pursed his lips. "Even Beijing's Imperial Palace has nothing like it."

"Then it's a priceless treasure? A tribute to the Emperor—Chiefs could become high officials!"

Xiao Zishan smiled helplessly. The commoners' words reflected the simplest understanding: good things belonged to the Emperor. Centuries of Chinese dynasties had plundered the best things from their subjects for one surname's enjoyment. Anything labeled "tribute" was guaranteed to be of high quality.

"The clock's purpose is precise time control," Xiao Zishan redirected. "Before, people only knew the approximate time from the sun's position, night watches, drum towers, or noon cannons. With clocks, you know the exact time at any moment. You know how much time any task took."

"What's the use?" someone asked. "When I herded the landlord's cattle, I went all day. I left at dawn and returned before dark. That's it."

"Just learn clock-reading for now. As for its uses—you'll naturally understand later."

Xiao Zishan knew that explaining this to youths from 400 years ago was difficult. With the exception of astronomical and calendar specialists, traditional agriculture rarely needed precise time. Precise timing was a requirement of modern science.

This phase was "general education." Rather than teaching complex advanced science, quickly adapting the newcomers to the transmigrator units' terminology and habits was more important. Only barrier-free communication could enable effective command.

Afternoons were for drill—just like the recruits. The main focus was formation training. With forty days of quarantine Mandarin, they understood the instructor's commands. Though some were still confused about left and right, being pulled out and beaten for incomprehension was rare.

Evenings were like the recruits'—political education, repeated indoctrination, plus extra knowledge.

Compared to regular recruits, their classes were heavier—recruits only had literacy and arithmetic in the evening or during bad weather. Ma Qianzhu had high expectations but decided against excessive special treatment for now. He would let them temper in the Training Battalion's collective to observe who would become the future backbone.

Tian Liang struggled. Already not clever, he had received beatings in quarantine for bad grades. Now things were even harder. The final specialty exams landed him in the infantry track. The Ruan brothers' excellent grades got them into the artillery track. One day, a blue-uniformed "Chief" came. Upon learning the Ruan brothers were fishermen's sons, they were assigned to the "Navy"—roughly translated as "water forces."

Afterwards, the branches split. The Ruan brothers now studied artillery firing tables and various shooting methods, spending every morning pushing cannons around and drilling gun operations endlessly. The funniest part was learning to harness limbers. Cannons and limbers were attached via specialized leather straps to draft horses. Small guns needed one horse; the largest needed eight. To get familiar with horses, the artillerymen periodically visited the Farm for stable duty. Afternoons were spent with slide rules, compasses, and surveying equipment.

Tian Liang practiced shouldering wooden guns, donning rattan armor for bayonet drill, squad formation changes, trench digging, earthwork building, and wall construction.

Every few days, instructors led field marches, constantly training against hypothetical targets. Sometimes they did short-distance charges—running fast while stabbing enemies upon reaching positions.

The worst were the forced marches. Everyone carried dozens of kilograms, trotting 15km on mountain paths or paddy dikes, arriving within time limits, immediately fortifying, and then splitting into opposing teams. Combat drills included shooting using wooden guns. These weren't just weighted sticks anymore—they were iron-weighted training rifles. Everything except shooting was complete: barrels, touch holes, and bayonet mounts. Simulated shooting required full muzzle-loader procedures: bite the cartridge, load, cap—nothing skipped. Instructors criticized non-standard movements. After shooting came bayonet and hand-to-hand combat. Combat continued until one side expelled the other. The losers handled bivouac construction and cooking. Sometimes training became real fighting—bloody noses, cracked skulls, and broken bones were common.

Then, the medical trainee nurses proved useful—casualties became their practice specimens. Those "Technical School" girls all became Medical Group nursing students. Shi Niaoren planned to train some as qualified doctors, secretly teaching several clever girls a strange language: Latin.

These trainee nurses had little equipment or medication. Their regulation Red Cross med kits—despite being the latest models from 400 years in the future—were basically empty. Besides alcohol, cotton, splints, suture needles, and simple Chinese medicines, there was nothing useful. All modern drugs were personally controlled by the Medical Group doctors. Fortunately, survivors to teenage years were Darwinian victors with decent constitutions. Simple treatment plus rest allowed them to recover.

During one exercise, Tian Liang spotted Guo Fu. She wore the same clothing—but her hair was growing out, and she wore a brimless soft cap. She wore an armband with strange embroidery: a blue snake coiled around a stick—the insignia of every "nurse."

During that exercise, Tian Liang fought especially hard, hoping for a minor wound so he could see Guo Fu and chat. But his exceptional valor sent his opponents to the infirmary while he remained unharmed. He could only frustratedly watch Guo Fu from a distance.

Once adapted to training, instructors added night assembly tricks. Deep sleep would be suddenly interrupted by an emergency assembly. Failure to assemble with full equipment within ten minutes meant a ten-lap penalty. That was manageable. The worst were the night marches. Everyone wore a white cloth strip on their back for single-file night marching.

Ancient armies rarely fought at night. First, ancient communications couldn't control night marching directions, let alone combat. Second, without proper maps, even daytime navigation was problematic without guides—nighttime was impossible.

Precisely because ancient armies avoided night combat, the transmigrators trained for it. For the numerically inferior but training-superior New Army, night fighting effectively negated enemy numbers.

Night training wasn't just marching. It involved squad-level tactical movement in darkness, coordinating entirely via whistles, fifes, and bugles. Necessary cases used signal rockets. The Red Army and Eighth Route Army had no walkie-talkies, yet they still dominated night battles.

Then came wilderness survival. Bei Wei's training syllabus originally covered tropical/subtropical through snowy north. But considering there would be no development in the Northeast for 2–3 years, the focus was on local areas and South China. Slide projectors proved invaluable—especially for plant and animal identification. First pictures, then field observation. Then: compass use, wilderness direction-finding, weather prediction, shelter construction, first aid... Finally, soldiers in squad units were sent into the mountains for ten days to complete various tasks. Each could bring one dagger, one *jin* of raw rice, and some salt. To prevent trainees from harassing civilians during wilderness training, Bei Wei's special team monitored them—simultaneously training themselves.
