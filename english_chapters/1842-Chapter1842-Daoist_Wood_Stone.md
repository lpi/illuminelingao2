# Chapter 1842 - Daoist Wood-Stone

The confession Lian Nishang obtained in Fangchun Court soon reached Mu Min's desk. Mu Min ordered a copy to be made immediately and forwarded to Wu Mu. Liang Cunhou was already on the Political Security Bureau's "observation list," and any material involving him or his family would be copied and put into the newly established file.

The reconnaissance work on Liang Cunhou was the Political Security Bureau's affair; Mu Min wouldn't interfere. But she vaguely felt there was some connection between Fangchun Court and the Mao Family Inn case. This was an intuition forged by long-term police work. She sent Lian Nishang a warrant, ordering her to "dig up the roots and grab typical examples" in Fangchun Court, specifically to investigate the persecution of prostitutes in the brothel.

Mu Min revealed this matter at the internal briefing, which indeed immediately aroused the strong interest of various parties in Fangchun Court. Rectifying the sex industry was one of the Senate's important administrative outlines in Guangzhou. It not only involved positive factors like "transforming social atmosphere," "social reform," and "women's liberation," but for the local government, it also had benefits in both "rectifying public security" and "tax revenue." Therefore, relevant departments requested to be deeply involved in this event, using it as a "typical example."

Wen Desi, who presided over the meeting, immediately waved his big pen and announced that various departments would form a joint working group in Fangchun Court to carry out "on-site office work."

Once this order was issued, the Propaganda Department beat everyone to it. Dingding first sent people to do special reports, closely followed by Mayor Liu sending people to station there, and then the naturalized cadres from the Commerce Bureau and Purple Lightning Tower Entertainment Co., Ltd. also went... The entrance of Fangchun Court was busy with traffic and people coming and going. Everyone on Music Workshop Street knew: Fangchun Court was finished.

Mu Min was naturally happy to have everyone help. Moreover, her intention was mainly to use this to beat Liang Cunhou, forcing him to make a move.

As long as he moved, there would be flaws.

Mu Min thought, the next one to clean up would be the Guan Di Temple group. This abscess was also time to burst.

"Old Immortal, how should we take this next step?"

Still in the adobe house in the small courtyard in a humble alley of Guangzhou city, a layman and a Daoist were talking by the window.

"Is Yuewan's side safe?"

"Although Fangchun Court is already a pot of boiling water, her side is still calm. The hair-thieves haven't come to bother. Entry and exit are neither prohibited nor questioned." Manager Hu said, "Calculating this search, the Young Master is truly blessed by heaven!"

"This is all merit accumulated by your master treating subordinates well usually," the Daoist stroked his beard. "It's just a pity that Fangchun Court is ruined."

"Whatever Old Immortal says is right. It's just that Miss Suiyun suffered quite a bit." Manager Hu sighed, "My Young Master also wants to ask the Old Immortal for an idea. Can he go to Yuewan's side or not?"

The Daoist nodded: "Naturally, he cannot. The hair-thieves searching Yuewan's courtyard means they inevitably became suspicious of your master, this is one; secondly, the hair-thieves are raising a big prison in Fangchun Court. I heard Han Qiaojie, Muyun, and others all suffered severe torture, fearing they have confessed everything. Thirdly, now that hair-thieves are gathered in Fangchun Court, with the sound of beating shaking the sky, which rich young master would rush eagerly to enjoy such scenery? Abnormality signifies demons; how could the hair-thieves not think of this point?"

Manager Hu nodded in agreement, then said: "Han Qiaojie's side doesn't matter; presumably, they don't have anything important to say..."

The Daoist slowly shook his head and didn't continue. He was the Daoist Wood-Stone mentioned by Han Qiaojie. Although his face looked old and haggard, he was actually still in his prime. This was both the trace of years of wandering, sleeping in the wind and eating dew, and toiling on the road, and also his intentional doing.

Although he showed himself as a wandering Daoist, he actually served in the Jin Yi Wei (Imperial Guard) originally. Using geomancy, ghost catching, exorcism, and medical treatment as a cover, he went deep into various places to investigate public sentiment and monitor officials. After the Chongzhen Emperor ascended the throne and abolished the Jin Yi Wei's practice of monitoring officials, he lost his job and was recruited by the court boss "Stone Old Man" (Shi Weng) to work for him.

Since the hair-thieves arrived in Qiongzhou eight years ago, he had been running around for his master on this matter all these years. However, several plots failed at the last moment. This time he came to Guangzhou not only to use sorcery against the hair-thieves but also to shoulder an important mission from his master.

"Not that I'm paranoid, but I'm afraid the hair-thieves have already laid a dragnet around Music Workshop Street, just waiting for us to drill in." Daoist Wood-Stone said slowly, "Looking for a child from Fangchun Court was truly a major miscalculation!" Saying this, he couldn't help but sigh with regret.

Because the wind outside was very tight, the Guan Di Temple group dared not involve themselves in child trafficking anymore. Human traffickers also dared not buy and sell children of unknown origin at will. For a time, they couldn't find a suitable one, which was why the idea of looking for a suitable candidate among the *pipazai* through Yuewan's relationship arose.

Actually, Mingnu's horoscope was also barely acceptable, just the closest among the girls they could lay hands on. Wuzhiqí had warned several times that the days for performing magic were passing. If a suitable child wasn't found, the formation would be completely ruined. Only then did Daoist Wood-Stone think of using *pipazai*. Many *pipazai* were abducted by "flower-patters" (kidnappers), their origins unknown. No one would care if they disappeared. And because this Mingnu was bought secretly and didn't even report for a temporary residence permit at the police station, she was even "cleaner."

Unexpectedly, the hair-thief police were so serious, turning Guangzhou city upside down to search for a little girl, finally not hesitating to force their way into a gentry's outer residence! Neither Daoist Wood-Stone nor others involved in this expected this. Thinking of this, Daoist Wood-Stone couldn't help but be secretly annoyed.

Originally he didn't show the mountain or dew (kept a low profile), sitting firmly on the fishing boat. In this way, he was considered "exposed" to the hair-thieves. Not only that, but the Liang family was also implicated.

If following past experience, slipping away was the best choice once exposed. However, this time it wouldn't work. It could be said that none of the missions he shouldered were completed. Spending a large amount of money, he instead lost many lives—although those caught were hired with money, in case the hair-thieves opened a breach from them and took the opportunity to raise a big prison... leaving aside others, once the Liang family was implicated, his family had many relatives, tongnian (graduates of the same year), teachers, and friends in the capital. If they sent an army to blame, Stone Old Man's days would be very difficult!

He thought for a moment and said slowly: "The things at Yuewan's place must be destroyed as soon as possible—don't transfer them elsewhere anymore. If caught, it will be irrefutable evidence! Moreover, the hair-thieves don't care about gentry dignity; it's hard to guarantee they won't search again!"

Manager Hu said: "This lowly one understands."

"As for Miss Yuewan herself, there is no need to worry too much. The hair-thieves won't punish her for a while," Daoist Wood-Stone said. "The hair-thieves still cherish the incense sentiment (connection/favor) of your master's help back then. And their foothold in Guangdong is not stable yet; without sufficient reason, they won't touch the Tai Sui's head (offend powerful people). It's just that the hair-thieves are violent and eccentric by nature; simply don't touch their reverse scales for trivial matters. Today is not like the past."

Manager Hu said: "What the Daoist says is true."

Daoist Wood-Stone sighed: "You and I have been acquaintances for many years. There is a sentence I must say, insufficient for outsiders' ears."

Manager Hu said: "Old Immortal speaks heavily. Please speak."

Daoist Wood-Stone said slowly: "I thought Wuzhiqí's magic power was extremely high and could definitely stir up big waves in the city. Unexpectedly, his Daoist magic was broken—perhaps the Great Ming's luck involves ended..."

Manager Hu showed a fearful expression. The court's luck was low, and the Emperor Star was dim—Daoist Wood-Stone had mentioned this several times when visiting Guangzhou. This time they made such a magic formation, but in the end, it was a total defeat. could it be that the Mandate of Heaven was really on the hair-thieves' side?

Thinking that in the first month of this year, the rogue bandits broke Fengyang, burned the imperial mausoleum... this Great Ming's luck was truly bad to the extreme. Could it be that these hair-thieves were also born in response to the calamity, and the Great Ming was really going to perish?

Thinking of this, he couldn't help but feel a chill on his back.

The Daoist continued: "I will abandon this place soon. You must never come here again. When I find a new place, I will contact you."

"Yes, then I will wait quietly for the Daoist's news."

"Please tell your master to retract his claws and teeth temporarily and hibernate. As long as the green hills remain, there's no fear of running out of firewood. Although Governor Xiong has retreated into Guangxi, the Emperor has not blamed him. Now various Wolf Troops and Tusi in Guangxi are being transferred to assist in the fight. I heard the White Rod Army will also be summoned."

"So, the Court has a plan to recover Guangzhou?" Manager Hu showed an excited look.

"Exactly."

After Manager Hu left, Daoist Wood-Stone called his accompanying young apprentice and whispered a few instructions.

"Go contact Master Mo and tell him to pass a message to Gao Tianshi: The offering is gone. No matter what means he uses, get another offering quickly."

Daoist Wood-Stone vaguely felt in his heart that he should perhaps kill this demon Daoist immediately and then leave this place of right and wrong, Guangzhou. But he couldn't fail to give an explanation to his master. Whether this Daoist Wu's magic worked or not, just like a drowning person, there must be a life-saving straw to grab.

He silently poured out the tea in Manager Hu's cup and washed the tea cup clean. He had already put poison in the tea—this poison was obtained from the East Bureau (Dong Chang). According to the dosage, it was divided into one-day onset, two-day onset, three-day onset, up to a maximum of seven-day onset. In the past, the East Bureau often used this to secretly execute anyone the Emperor and the East Bureau felt "annoyed" with. Manager Hu wouldn't live past tomorrow night after returning—even if a doctor was called, he would probably only be diagnosed with an attack of colic (绞肠痧).

Liang Cunhou couldn't do this, but he could.

Speaking of poisoning Manager Hu, he was actually a bit sad. Manager Hu was a subordinate *fanzi* (agent) under him in the early years. Ordered to come to Guangzhou to monitor Liang Cunhou's grandfather, the former Zhejiang Right Administration Commissioner Liang Younian, during the Tianqi era, he had been a servant in the Liang Residence for more than ten years now. He was a capable officer under him. However, he had met and contacted him many times, knowing too much and being too big a target. Once arrested, he would inevitably implicate the Liang family. The consequences would be unimaginable. It was better to remove him quickly and cleanly.

Fortunately, besides this Daoist magic, he still had a backup plan. Just didn't know if there was enough time. If only the Great Ming also had the "telegraph" that could transmit news instantly like the hair-thieves. Daoist Wood-Stone couldn't help thinking.
