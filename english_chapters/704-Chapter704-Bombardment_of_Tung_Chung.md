# Chapter 704 - Bombardment of Tung Chung

Chen Haiyang demanded that within three days, all pirate observation posts be eliminated to completely cut off their intelligence sources. This was somewhat difficult for the Special Recon Team. Lantau Island was large and almost entirely mountainous, with hiding spots for observation posts everywhere. However, Chen Sigen quickly discovered the pirates had no concept of operational security. During the day, they cooked on the mountaintops; at night, they lit bonfires. The smoke and firelight made it easy for the recon team members to mark all post locations on their maps, then eliminate them one by one.

The post-clearing operations went smoothly. Each post had at least five or six men, but the pirates had no experience defending against stealth attacks. When suddenly assaulted, they appeared genuinely shocked. Chen Sigen's interrogations revealed the pirates simply didn't believe the enemy would go through the trouble of climbing mountains to attack them.

Overall, from what the pirates said, Chen Sigen learned that Guangdong's government troops were extremely "lazy"—they basically never took any intelligence measures.

By comparison, the pirates at least had some awareness in this regard, knowing to position lookouts at key transportation points. No wonder the ancients, when describing a decadent army, often used the term "arrogant and lazy."

From this post, the recon team members retrieved an iron pot, rice, various pickled vegetables, plus wooden buckets for carrying and storing water and other daily necessities. It seemed they had planned to stay here long-term.

"Looks like they were quite comfortable here, eating hot meals every day," Chen Sigen joked to his men.

"All they got was hot meals. How does that compare to us eating meat and fish at every meal?" one team member said. "Cold, sure—but the food's great!"

The Special Recon Team's rations were first-class supply standard: high in protein and calories. Each "Southern Seas" type field ration could provide 4,500 kilocalories. It even included items reserved for transmigrators only—like beef jerky and egg-butter crackers.

"After the battle, we'll go back to base for a proper feast—I hear there are wild boars on this island."

Another team member said: "Not just boars—there are roe deer and wild goats too."

"After the battle, we'll go hunting and treat ourselves." After saying this, Chen Sigen ordered the observation post destroyed, all equipment smashed—this location didn't meet their requirements. The Special Recon Team needed to establish observation posts where they could monitor Tung Chung.

The Special Recon Team's other mission was to find routes for transporting supplies from Lantau's eastern coast to the western mountaintops overlooking Tung Chung.

The entire island of Lantau had virtually no roads. Hardly anyone ventured into the mountainous interior; aside from gathering firewood and felling trees near the settlements, the island's small population rarely penetrated inland.

The Special Recon Team's task was to find paths through the roadless mountains that troops could traverse—paths capable of supporting the transport of equipment of a certain weight. They had been marking these routes for several days already. Some marines had already successfully reached the mountaintops around Tung Chung along the marked paths.

Shi Zhiqi was currently on the summit of Shangling Ridge. A camp had already been secretly established here. Marines and sailors made multiple daily round trips between here and Lantau's eastern coast. The 12-pounder mountain howitzers, disassembled and carried by manpower, along with the Hale rockets—also transported by hand—were being moved to the camp piece by piece.

Among these weapons, the 12-pounder mountain howitzers had limited range and moderate killing effect; they weren't the primary weapons. The Hale rockets were Shi Zhiqi's trump card. But the Hale rockets launched so quickly—without sufficient stockpiles, dozens of rockets would be expended in moments, failing to provide sustained suppression of the enemy.

"One hundred rockets have now been transported to Shangling Ridge," Shi Zhiqi reported to Chen Haiyang over the radio. "The transport rate can't go any faster! There are simply no roads here. A single round trip takes soldiers three to four hours. After dark, the paths become dangerous, so transport must stop."

"I'll assign additional sailors to you. The stockpile must be sufficient by the tenth."

"I understand. I'll complete the mission. Additionally, I request some blankets be allocated—it's very cold at night, and the soldiers are camping in the open without being able to light large fires."

"I'll instruct the logistics staff officer. Over."

By September 9th, the Special Recon Team had established observation posts on the mountains around Tung Chung, monitoring the harbor's pirate ship movements around the clock. Marines and a temporary landing force composed of shipboard sailors had also taken their positions under cover of darkness, landing on Lantau's eastern coast and moving into position. Artillery and Hale rockets were prepared on the mountaintops. This Pearl River Estuary campaign had been equipped with large quantities of rockets for conducting extensive harassing operations. Now was the perfect opportunity to expend some of them.

At a single command, the rockets launched from Liujiao Mountain and Shangling Ridge toward Tung Chung would be sufficient to throw the entire pirate fleet into extreme chaos. It was said even the Danish fleet couldn't withstand the British Navy's rocket bombardment; a pirate fleet certainly couldn't maintain calm action under dense rocket fire.

While attack preparations proceeded intensively, Zheng Bao was also preparing to attack. Wang You's failure to achieve anything had actually pleased Zheng Bao—he had no desire to put some "leader" above himself.

At noon on September 10th, Chen Haiyang boarded his own *Lint Special 11* and ordered all vessels except *Dajing* and the garrison fleet to weigh anchor. Two patrol boat squadrons and seven special-service boat squadrons—36 warships in all—sailed northwest, rounding the Ma Wan Channel toward Lantau's Tung Chung.

At dawn's first light, all warships advanced in single file. Each ship maintained a set interval from the next, sailing briskly through wind and waves. Chen Haiyang stood on the stern castle, periodically observing the fleet's navigation status.

---

Eight single-masted triangular-sailed patrol boats sailed close-hauled on both wings of the fleet, constantly patrolling the sea surface. On Chen Haiyang's orders, patrol boats sank any stray vessels they encountered, to prevent warning messages from reaching the enemy.

"Fleet speed?"

"2.5 knots!" a staff officer reported.

"Any word from the observation posts?"

"Report fifteen minutes ago: no anomalies at Tung Chung."

"Have the marines and sailor landing force reached their staging positions?"

"The artillery is still moving heavy weapons and ammunition. Squad Leader Shi says they can be in position in another ninety minutes."

"Good. Tell the observation posts to monitor enemy movements closely." Chen Haiyang's greatest concern was the artillery. Lantau was mountainous; the peaks had no roads, and everything had to be carried up by human labor. Delays were all too easy.

Chen Haiyang sat in his high-backed chair. At this speed, reaching battle positions would take another three-plus hours. They would arrive around 3 PM—sun beginning its western descent. He would lead his fleet into battle with the sun at their backs, while the pirates would have to fight facing the sun. This small advantage was quite useful in the age of sail.

At 3:30 PM, under Chen Haiyang's unified command, the sailor landing force launched Hale rockets from Liujiao Mountain and Shangling Ridge as the signal to begin the general assault. The expeditionary fleet entered combat.

Most rockets launched from the various mountaintops around Tung Chung were aimed at the pirate ships in the harbor. Some were also directed at the residential areas near the harbor mouth—Chen Haiyang believed these might be pirate encampments.

Following the rockets, the mountain howitzers opened fire—they fired explosive shells whose effect was limited, primarily intended to increase the chaos at Tung Chung.

When the first rocket, trailing thick smoke, landed in the harbor waters, the pirates swarmed onto their decks to watch this rare spectacle. When they saw more and more rockets appear in the sky, all plummeting toward their heads, the entire Tung Chung harbor erupted in chaos.

Six rockets per minute fell upon the waters and land of Tung Chung. Ships and buildings continuously caught fire, smoke billowing skyward. One rocket struck a ship; after the explosion, fierce flames instantly engulfed the entire vessel, and the gunpowder aboard detonated, hurling debris into the air. Some rockets landed directly among crowds, turning bodies into balls of fire rolling frantically across the ground.

Dense clusters of sampans and long-dragons moored at the jetties were hit by over a dozen rockets. The small boats caught fire one after another, immediately engulfing the jetty in flames and thick smoke that blotted out the sun.

The pirates and village residents were dumbstruck by this sudden, heaven-sent attack. But when the second wave of rockets rose from the mountaintops in a terrifying yet spectacular display, the pirates panicked completely. All these Hale rockets were fitted with whistles that shrieked as they flew and fell. The shrill screaming came closer and closer, seeming to plunge directly toward their heads.

Amid the jumble of screams and rocket shrieks, people trampled one another. Many rushed toward the ships, desperate to weigh anchor and sail, to escape this hell ruled by the screaming gods of death.

Wang You forced himself to remain calm. Since returning to Tung Chung, he hadn't accomplished any concrete subversion work, but he knew which chiefs harbored longstanding resentment toward Zheng Bao. Seeing the chaos around him, he quickly sent word to summon several trustworthy men, preparing to seize the moment to clarify the situation and act together.

Zheng Bao had originally been drinking and reveling in a small village at Tung Chung—he'd had several women from nearby villages brought to him for entertainment. After the negotiations failed and subversion proved hopeless, Wang You had greatly displeased him. Zheng Bao had decided that regardless of the Australians' attitude, he would lead his forces into the Pearl River for some major action. What came after could wait. After all, Liu Xiang leaving the Pearl River Estuary was a rare opportunity. Not seizing the chance would be a waste.

Just as he entertained himself while planning which villages and towns to raid, a commotion erupted outside, followed by chaotic shrieking and explosions. Zheng Bao's pleasant wine-buzz vanished instantly. He hurriedly pushed the woman aside and rose from the bamboo couch.

"What's happening? What's all the commotion outside?" he shouted. It didn't look like government troops attacking—if so, the lookouts he'd posted on the surrounding mountains should have sent warnings long ago.
