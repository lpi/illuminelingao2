# Chapter 1251 - Naval Battle (Part 2)

The tension multiplied. On the *Chedian*, Monde had locked the fire director firmly onto the leading European-style large ship, waiting only for the order to fire from the bridge.

The distance narrowed to 2500 meters. Monde heard a low roar ahead and looked up to see *Lichun* firing its first shot, the flag for engaging to starboard rising. He shouted, "HE shell fire!"

The shells, poised and ready, thundered out of the barrels. The following warships fired in sequence. Black smoke clouds and multicolored water columns instantly rose within Zheng Lian's fleet formation. The battle had begun.

The Zheng warships returned fire immediately. The Red Barbarian Cannons on every ship opened fire regardless of range. Red cannonballs trailing black smoke tumbled through the air, flying toward the First Squadron. Most fell into the sea without getting close; only a few flew near the fleet, but the distance to the warships was still too great. The splashes didn't even wet the decks of the First Squadron's warships.

"Not good enough," Le Lin stood on the bridge of *Yufeng*, holding American Navy binoculars against his chest and wearing a high-imitation American Navy white summer uniform. Looking at the distant enemy shell impacts, he shook his head, full of ambition, recalling patrolling in a fishing boat back in the day, feeling a myriad of emotions.

On *Lichun*, Gunnery Chief Ruan Xiaowu lay nervously on the bow angle board sight, aiming at the splash raised by the first shell's fall. One hand held a Zhong-brand stopwatch as big as an alarm clock hanging on his chest, calculating the distance—after three months of study, he had just been promoted to this post. Although no longer a captain, being a department head on such a big black ship was much better than being captain of a special service boat. Everyone in the Navy knew that officers and NCOs selected to serve on steam black ships, even ordinary sailors, had great future prospects.

Since optical rangefinders were high-tech and usable products couldn't be produced immediately, what was installed on the warships was an artillery rangefinder direction board system: an angle board with a sight was installed at both the bow and stern. Using the sight to aim at the target, the distance between the warship and the target was calculated based on the difference in angles shown at the bow and stern.

The gunnery officer added a certain distance to this reading for the first shot, then fired the second based on the reading, and finally subtracted a certain distance from the reading for the third shot. The three shots had identical range intervals and close timing, allowing for rapid trajectory correction based on impact points.

Although this ranging method was backward with large data errors, compared to the general standard of this spacetime where ranging basically relied on estimation, it was already Zenith Star technology.

"2350 meters!" he shouted. Subsequently, the fire direction center began calculating firing data and adjusting gun elevation. Simultaneously, firing parameters were conveyed to each ship via light signals.

The 4 gunboats followed *Lichun* in firing sequentially. Almost all shells flew toward the European-style ship leading Zheng Lian's fleet. This three-masted large ship displacing 700 tons was almost immediately submerged by water columns. Suddenly, a flash of fire appeared amidst the spray. A 130mm HE shell hit the hull, tearing the hard ship planks like tearing a piece of paper. Hull fragments flew everywhere, slicing off the heads and arms of seven or eight sailors on deck. A large fire started immediately.

Next, the First Squadron's fire became increasingly accurate. Within 4 minutes of the first hit, this ship was hit 2 times by 130mm shells. Masts and rigging were totally destroyed, the whole ship engulfed in fire, paralyzed on the sea surface turning into a giant torch.

Zheng Lian realized in an instant he had absolutely no possibility of winning a gun duel against the opponent. He roared, ordering the fire ships to ignite and charge. However, the next fatal blow arrived just then. A 130mm HE shell exploded on the flagship's outer hull, several inches of thick oak. It instantly tore a huge hole; a massive hull plank was flipped into the air, then smashed heavily onto the deck, killing several sailors on spot. Gunpowder in open jars on the gun deck was ignited and detonated. The 80 sailors loading and firing on the gun deck were killed almost instantly. Fierce fire sprayed out from the gratings on the deck.

"Quick, come about!" Zheng Lian shouted from the poop deck. This shell had completely woken him up: what talk of victory or defeat now, escaping with life was what mattered!

However, escaping under the First Squadron's fire wasn't easy. Although the 130mm guns had a slow rate of fire and limited hits, 75mm shells hit the hull and deck one after another. Fragments flew, fierce fires raged. The helmsman turned the wheel desperately; the warship swung 180 degrees to port. The wind brought more air to the transverse ship deck, white-hot tongues of fire spreading everywhere. The already opened gunpowder jars on deck began exploding one by one.

Seeing the magazine explosion was inevitable, Zheng Lian disregarded the height of the poop deck and jumped into the sea. Just the moment he jumped, tongues of fire rushed into the magazine. Bright red flames rose from the deck, followed by a low explosion sound. Charred fragments danced in the air, then the whole ship suffered a violent explosion. The deck tore and flipped upward, masts twisted and fell inward, sails instantly swallowed by fire snakes. Sky-reaching smoke and fire enveloped this thousand-ton large ship; black smoke lingered for a long time.

The flagship catching fire and exploding caused the other warships to lose all will to fight. Three-masted gunships and other Fujian and Guangdong ships turned around one after another attempting to flee. But they had come with favorable wind and tide; changing direction now was extremely difficult. Compared to the First Squadron operating entirely on steam engines, it was tantamount to dancing naked in front of the enemy. Each ship seized the opportunity to fire fiercely while shortening the distance.

Turbines spun wildly, boilers emitted terrifying roars. White spray kicked up by the bow was immediately cut and crushed by the hull. Blue and white Morning Star flags shook straight on the masts. Cannons on every warship fired at maximum rate, pouring maximum ammunition onto the enemy using this briefly advantageous position. Shells trailing red traces rained down on Zheng Lian's fleet, occasionally raising a ball of black-red flame, scorching fragments dancing in the air.

130mm and 75mm HE shells displayed terrifying power on wooden ships. Hardwood hulls several inches thick, originally capable of withstanding solid shot, became incredibly fragile under HE attack, torn and burned like paper. Although many shells failed to explode due to fuse issues, the higher muzzle velocity of conical shells fired by rifled guns allowed them to easily penetrate hulls, achieving certain destructive effects.

Dense smoke after cannon firing occasionally covered the decks. Sea breeze blew the smoke away in gusts. Lookouts constantly reported hit status to the bridge.

The battle had actually turned into a one-sided shooting performance. After five capital ships were successively heavily damaged and sunk, the Zheng fleet had lost combat effectiveness; the remaining ships were just trying to escape. But ignoring naval tactics like turning before the enemy made them the best targets. Gunners did their utmost to display their gunnery levels; ship after ship was hit, caught fire, and sank.

Observations showed over 14 ships hit, 10 of which caught fire, and another 5 had disappeared from the sea surface: likely sunk or withdrawn from battle.

The 20-plus fire ships entering the battlefield ignited together in the chaos and began to charge. Fire ships had favorable wind and tide, very advantageous, but their position was furthest from the First Squadron. When hastily launching the attack, there was still a distance of nearly 3000 meters. Even advancing at 6 knots, they were easily evaded by the First Squadron.

"Fuck!" A leader saw the Hair Rebel ships actually running fast against the wind, simply disbelieving his eyes. What kind of battle was this? Let alone chasing, his own ship struggled even to turn; how could he talk about ramming?

Once evaded, chasing steam warships of the First Squadron sailing against wind and current was simply an impossible task for fire ships relying on wind for sprint power.

Under the strong blowing of the sea breeze, sailors not only found it difficult to control the ship's turn, but the fire already ignited was blown larger and larger. Scorching air made it hard for sailors to survive, forcing them to abandon ship one after another. Out-of-control burning fire ships drifted aimlessly pushed by the wind.

At 10:40, Ming Qiu ordered the First Squadron to cease fire and begin turning. Part of the Zheng fleet ships lay paralyzed on the water burning furiously, part had sunk to the bottom. Except for a few Fujian and Guangdong ships lagging behind that were quick to seize the opportunity and turned rudder to escape in time, not one in ten of Zheng Lian's fleet remained.

Subsequent fire ships didn't know the battle situation ahead. Keeping entering the battlefield, they only saw black smoke rushing to the sky, burning wreckage everywhere on the sea, and dense cannon smoke making the sea surface dim. Fire ship sailors were at a loss—they had received orders beforehand to launch attacks according to flagship flag signals, but now the flagship couldn't be found, and where the enemy was couldn't be seen clearly either.

While hesitating, a gust of sea breeze blew, clearing part of the smoke shrouding the sea. Fire ship sailors suddenly saw a terrifying scene: their own biggest warships were burning on the sea surface; Zheng Lian's flagship had burned to the waterline. In the distance, five black ships spewing black smoke were making a huge turn, waves rolling, like sea monsters gathering momentum to rush over for a killing strike.

Without much hesitation, the moment a 130mm shell whistled over and fell into the water, ships turned their bows one after another, fleeing in all directions: sailors worked on fire ships to fight for rations and pay, for high silver rewards, not to die for nothing.
