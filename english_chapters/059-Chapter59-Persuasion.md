# Chapter 59: Persuasion

Both sides sat in silence. Ran Yao studied the man carefully. Suddenly, he noticed something—an inconspicuous red trace on the man's cuff. He grabbed the arm abruptly. Guo Yi flinched, about to struggle, but was pinned down by those beside him.

Ran Yao scraped the mark with his fingernail, raised it to his nose, and sniffed. A strange smile spread across his face:

"There's a woman." It was lipstick residue.

He ordered his men: "Report to the Committee—stowaways on the ship. One in custody; at least one female still aboard!" He added: "They may be armed!"

"Yes, sir!"

"Notify He Ming and Zhao De. Full sweep of the camp and ships! Check everyone's ID cards. Anyone without a card—detain on the *Fengcheng* for identification."

The comprehensive search quickly resolved matters. The Military Group searched the *Fengcheng* cabin by cabin. The carpet sweep found two ATF agents in a storage compartment near the bottom hold. Having gone a day without food, the agents—facing gleaming SKS bayonets—chose cooperation over heroics and surrendered peacefully.

The two ATF agents were quite cooperative, quickly explaining how they'd tracked the North American Branch's gun purchases and shipments all the way to China. Xue Ziliang tried bargaining with Ran Yao, offering a large reward if he could help them contact the American consulate or find another way out.

Ran Yao smiled and shook his head: "Good offer, but nobody can collect."

"Afraid?" Xue Ziliang shrugged. "The US government can protect you..."

"I believe in the US government's capabilities. Problem is, they don't exist right now."

Xue Ziliang whistled: "Alright, alright, I know this is Chinese government territory." He smiled slyly. "Or maybe it isn't."

"Do you know today's date?"

"20XX, X month, X day."

"Wrong. Today is 1628 AD—the first day of the ninth month in the Chinese calendar." Ran Yao shook his head. "You've arrived in another timespace."

The two Americans stared at him like he was insane, then broke into mysterious smiles.

"I knew it." Ran Yao muttered to himself. This reaction was entirely expected.

In the *Fengcheng*'s Committee conference room, items confiscated from the three stowaways covered the table—passports, credentials, documents, pistols... scattered everywhere. The two ATF agents had even more—two full backpacks—but no food. They apparently hadn't expected to stay long.

"So this is the legendary X Department." Wen Desi picked up Guo Yi's credentials and flipped through them.

"This Guo Yi won't say anything—very disciplined." Ran Yao couldn't help praising him.

"And the Americans?"

"They talked. They came tracking the North American Branch, and that's how they ended up with Xiao Guo."

"Their purpose is irrelevant now—they can't go back anyway." Xiao Zishan said. "Let's discuss what to do with them."

"When you say 'deal with,' it sounds a bit like 'eliminate.' Chilling."

Dr. Zhong was quite relaxed: "What comes, stays. These are useful talents. We can absorb them into our team."

"Xiao Guo is manageable—an educable comrade. What about the Americans?"

"Isn't one Chinese-American?"

"An ABC. Doesn't identify with you at all."

"Here? Who can he identify with—17th-century English or Dutch? Only we represent advanced civilization. He'll have to accept that whether he wants to or not." Wang Luobin was fairly optimistic.

"True. Isn't New York still a village right now?"

"The Dutch only acquired Manhattan Island two years ago. It's called New Amsterdam now." Yu Eshui said.

Ma Qianzhu said: "Personal opinion: we can absorb them. All three are trained law-enforcement personnel with knowledge and weapons experience—very useful to strengthen our security team. Having Military Group handle policing leaves them too busy."

Ran Yao nodded repeatedly, indicating support. Then he made a suggestion: among the accidentally transported family, the daughter-in-law was also police—a detective. He requested she also be assigned to the Security Group.

"You're all talking excitedly." Xiao Zishan said. "They still think I'm a mental patient. Who wants to work for lunatics?"

"We need proof this is real... phones have no signal?" Wang Luobin said.

"There are always places without signal."

"GPS has no signal."

"You're jamming it."

"The beacon tower."

"An ancient monument. Or a fake antique."

"Ming-era furniture."

"Modern reproductions exist."

Wang Luobin blinked, unable to think of anything new.

"I've said all this. Useless—totally useless." Xiao Zishan spread his hands helplessly.

Then Yu Eshui spoke: "Just release them."

"Release?!" All eyes turned to him.

"Yes, release them. Let them see for themselves." Yu Eshui said. "They don't believe this is 1628 Hainan? Seeing is believing. When Director Wen first showed us the wormhole, we only believed after seeing it ourselves. This is too far beyond normal—I wouldn't believe it either. Let them walk around and look. Let facts speak."

"What if they run off and something happens on the road? Old and young, none vaccinated."

"Can't be helped. Revolution requires sacrifices. If they won't be fellow transmigrators, their fate is their own..." Yu Eshui's small eyes gleamed. Everyone felt a clench.

"We could release all seven together." Zhao De chuckled. "They'll definitely stick together. After traveling a while and finding things wrong, they'll start fighting..."

Zhong Lishi objected: "According to interrogation records, all seven have excellent backgrounds and abilities—any could be a protagonist in a transmigration novel. Together, they might form a second transmigration faction in Hainan! Even without our technological base, they could ally with the Ming!"

Zhao De smiled: "Impossible. Setting aside whether the Ming would accept them—look at how complex this group of seven is: ordinary civilians, People's Police, American agents—four women among them. We came together with a common goal after over a year of team-building. What shared goal do they have? At the first setback, they'll definitely turn on each other."

"After they've fought it out, they'll understand and come back." Zhao De said slowly. "Taking them in then beats Zishan's current thankless pleading that only earns curses."

"What if Ming people capture them, or just kill them? It's not impossible."

"Why would they kill such strangely dressed special individuals? Ming people aren't savages. They'll certainly keep them alive. Letting them suffer a bit before rescuing them would be even better." Zhao De said. "If they're truly unlucky and die—can't be helped."

Xiao Zishan nodded: "Fine then. I suggest we inspect their belongings, keep what we need, and give them basic rations and tools..."

"No," Zhao De interrupted. "Since we're releasing them, be generous. Return everything. Fully demonstrate our come-and-go-as-you-please policy. Even if we lose it all, so what? It's all extra stuff—don't begrudge it."

"If Ming local officials capture them, won't they reveal us?"

"So what?" Zhao De countered. "They think we're insane; Ming officials will consider them crazy too. Whether they'll even understand each other's language is questionable."

Guo Yi didn't face the torture he'd imagined. He even received some mantou and pickled vegetables. After eating, he was taken to a cabin. On the table sat a stainless-steel pot and some half-empty dishes. Xue Ziliang was wolfing down mantou, slurping congee noisily. This 100kg hulk's eating manner was quite ugly. Salina looked haggard—a day without food had sunken her eyes, her blue eyes listless. She held a half-eaten mantou, seemingly unable to swallow.

Even as an ABC, apparently, she still had a Chinese stomach. The pure Western horse clearly suffered from culture shock.

"Guo, what did they ask you?" Xue Ziliang swallowed the last mantou and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.

"They asked. I didn't talk."

"Sorry, Guo—we told them everything..." Xue Ziliang said innocently.

"I know, I know—your capture policies, very humane, very humane..." Guo Yi had lost interest in this topic. What concerned him was how these bandits would handle them.

No more interrogation—maybe they were satisfied with Xue Ziliang's confession, or maybe they considered them useless now... Guo Yi's hair stood on end. Looking at the well-fed Xue Ziliang—he truly was carefree.

"Guo, are you scared?" Xue Ziliang leaned closer.

Guo Yi wanted to maintain Chinese courage, but his reply betrayed him: "A little... What do you think of this group?"

Xue Ziliang fished a cigarette from his undershirt pocket. His lighter had been confiscated; he could only sniff it. "I think they mean no harm."

"?"

"There's something very strange." Xue Ziliang's joking expression disappeared. "The person who interrogated us kept trying to make us believe..." He lowered his voice. "...that it's currently 1628."

"What?!" Guo Yi couldn't believe his ears. How could anyone say something so absurd?

"Bizarre, right? At first I thought he was crazy. But Salina says he's not—absolutely mentally normal." For emphasis: "Salina has a master's in psychology. She can tell if someone's insane."

"That's not certain. Take pyramid schemes..." Guo Yi realized this example wouldn't work—Americans couldn't understand China's characteristic MLM industry. "Take cults. Psychiatrically speaking, they're not mad either..."

Xue Ziliang nodded: "Exactly. I think this organization has a cultish flavor."

Cults weren't Xiao Guo's department, but being in the same agency, he had basic knowledge.

"But they lack cult characteristics... like a leader, or totemic symbols."

"Ever heard of an underground organization called the Survival Church?"

"Survival Church?"

"Right. An organization of obscure origin. They stockpile massive supplies, build fortifications to survive nuclear war or other civilization-ending catastrophes... Their leader is supposedly named Wenster. Preaches doomsday theories, urging survivalists to prepare."

"Preaching the apocalypse is also a cult characteristic." Xiao Guo recalled.

"Remember the cargo manifest we saw? Those goods—too many and too varied for trade. But for rebuilding civilization?"

"You mean?!"

"Yes. I suspect this is an enormous con." Xue Ziliang said word by word. "Someone has fabricated a new world."
