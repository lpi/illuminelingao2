Chapter 59 Persuasion

Both sides were silent. Ran Yao looked at this person carefully. Suddenly he discovered a trace of inconspicuous red mark on this person's cuff. He pulled the arm up fiercely. Guo Yi was startled. Just as he wanted to struggle, he was pressed down by people around him.

Ran Yao scraped the mark with his fingernail, brought it to his nose and smelled it. A strange smile appeared on his face:

"There is also a woman." This was a smudge of lipstick.

He ordered his subordinate, "Report to the Executive Committee. There are stowaways on the ship. One has been captured. There is at least one female on the ship!" He added a sentence, "The opponent may possess weapons!"

"Yes!"

"Notify He Ming and Zhao De to conduct a comprehensive check in the camp and on the ships! Check everyone's ID card. Anyone without a card will be detained to the Fengcheng for identification."

Things soon became clear with the large-scale investigation. The Military Group checked cabin by cabin on the Fengcheng. The result of the carpet search was that two ATF agents were dragged out from a utility cabin near the bottom hold - the agents who hadn't eaten for a day didn't intend to show their bravery under the shining SKS bayonets, but obediently surrendered.

The two ATF agents were quite cooperative. They soon told the whole story of tracking the North American Branch buying and transporting guns all the way to China. Xue Ziliang attempted to negotiate with Ran Yao, proposing that if he could help contact the US Consulate or find other ways to help them escape, he could pay him a large sum of money.

Ran Yao smiled and shook his head: "The price is very good, but no one has the ability to take it."

"You are afraid?" Xue Ziliang shrugged, "The US government can protect you..."

"I believe in the capability of the US government. The problem is there is no such thing right now."

Xue Ziliang whistled: "Okay okay, I know this is the territory of the Chinese government." He smiled slyly, "Maybe not."

"Do you know what date is today?"

"Year 20XX, Month X, Day X."

"Wrong. Today is October 1st, 1628 AD, the first day of the ninth lunar month." Ran Yao shook his head, "You came to another space-time."

The two Yanks looked at him as if looking at a mental patient, and then smiled mysteriously.

"I knew it." Ran Yao muttered to himself with resentment. This reaction was completely within his expectation.

In the Executive Committee conference room on the ship, the things searched from the three stowaways were spread on a table. Passports, IDs, documents, pistols... bits and pieces spread on a table. The two ATF agents had more things, two full backpacks, but no food - probably thinking they wouldn't stay on the ship for long.

"This is the legendary Department X." Wen Desi picked up Guo Yi's ID and flipped through it.

"This Guo Yi refuses to say anything, very disciplined." Ran Yao didn't forget to praise him.

"What about the two Yanks?"

"Said everything. Came to track that group of people from North America, and just got mixed up with Little Guo like this."

"What they came for is meaningless now. Anyway, they can't go back." Xiao Zishan said, "Let's talk about how to deal with them."

"When you say deal with, this word implies 'dispose of', very chilling."

Dr. Zhong was quite dashing: "Since they are here, let them stay. These are useful talents and can be absorbed into the team."

"Little Guo is easy to handle, belonging to comrades who can be educated well. What about the two Americans?"

"Isn't one Chinese descent?"

"An ABC. Doesn't identify with you at all."

"What place is this? Who does he want to find identification with? 17th century British or Dutch? Only we are the representatives of advanced civilization. He has to identify even if he doesn't." Wang Luobin was relatively optimistic about this.

"That's true. New York is still a village now, right?"

"The Dutch only acquired Manhattan Island two years ago. Now it's called New Amsterdam." Yu Eshu said.

Ma Qianzhu said: "Personal opinion: Can absorb them. These few are formal law enforcement officers, with knowledge and weapon usage experience. Very useful to enrich the law enforcement team. If the Military Group personnel always act as public security, they are too busy."

Ran Yao nodded repeatedly, indicating support for Commissioner Ma's opinion. Then he made a suggestion. Among the family accidentally involved, the daughter-in-law was also of police origin, and a criminal police officer. He applied to transfer her to the Public Security Team as well.

"You guys talk lively." Xiao Zishan said, "Until now people still think I am a mental patient. Is anyone willing to work for a group of mental patients?"

"Must have something to prove we are real... No mobile phone signal?" Wang Luobin said.

"There are always places with no signal in this world."

"No GPS signal."

"Blocked by you guys."

"Beacon tower."

"Historic site. Or fake ancient building."

"Ming Dynasty furniture."

"Modern times can also make it."

Wang Luobin blinked, couldn't think of any new tricks.

"I've said all these. Useless, useless." Xiao Zishan spread his hands helplessly.

Yu Eshu said: "Release them all."

"Release?!" Everyone's eyes focused on him.

"Yes, release. Let them see for themselves." Yu Eshu said, "Don't they disbelieve this is Hainan in 1628? Hearing is false, seeing is believing. Back then everyone believed Wen Desi's wormhole only after seeing it with their own eyes. The matter is too beyond common sense. I wouldn't believe it either if I were them. Let them go and see for themselves, let facts speak."

"What if they escape and something happens on the road? Old and young, not vaccinated."

"Can't help it. Revolution requires paying a price. Unwilling to be fellow travelers, life and death can only be at will..." Yu Eshu's small eyes shone brightly. Making everyone's chrysanthemums tighten.

"Can release these seven people together." Zhao De chuckled, "At this moment they will definitely stick together. After walking for a while, finding it wrong, they will quarrel..."

Zhong Lishi raised an objection: "According to the interrogation records, the background and ability of these seven people are very good. Putting them in a time travel novel as protagonists would be no problem. Together, hard to guarantee a second time travel force won't appear in Hainan! Even without our technological foundation, they might defect to the Great Ming!"

Zhao De smiled: "Impossible. Leaving aside whether the Great Ming will take them in. Just look how complicated this seven-person group is. Common people, People's Police, American spies - and four women. We came together for a goal, and experienced a run-in period of more than a year. What common goal do they have to struggle for? Encountering a little setback, it would be strange if they didn't fall out immediately."

"When the quarrel is over, they will naturally understand and come back." Zhao De said slowly, "Taking them in at that time is much better than Zishan persuading earnestly and getting scolded now."

"What if they are caught by Ming people, or simply killed? Not impossible."

"Why kill such special characters with strange clothes? Ming people are not savages. Will definitely keep them. Letting them suffer for a few days and then rescuing them is better." Zhao De said, "If luck is really bad and they die, can't help it."

Xiao Zishan nodded: "This is also good. I suggest checking their things, keep those needed, just issue some most basic rations and tools or something..."

"No," Zhao De interrupted him, "Since releasing people, be generous. Return everything to them. Fully reflect our policy of freedom to come and go. Even if all lost, it doesn't matter. These things are extra anyway, no need to feel heartache."

"If Ming local officials catch them, will they leak our bottom?"

"So what?" Zhao De asked back, "They treat us as mental patients. Great Ming officials will treat them as madmen too. Besides, whether language can communicate is hard to say."

Guo Yi didn't encounter the imagined torture to extort confession, and even got a few steamed buns and a little preserved vegetable. After eating, he was sent to a cabin. On the table was a stainless steel pot and several half-empty plates. Xue Ziliang was devouring steamed buns, drinking porridge with slurp sounds. This 100KG burly man's eating manner was ugly enough. Salina looked haggard. Not eating for a day, her eye sockets were deep. A pair of blue eyes became listless, holding a half-eaten steamed bun in hand, looking unable to eat.

It seems even for an ABC, there is still a Chinese stomach. The purebred foreign horse was obviously unaccustomed to the climate and food.

"Guo, what did they ask you?" Xue Ziliang swallowed the last mouthful of steamed bun and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.

"Asked, I didn't say."

"Sorry, Guo, we said everything..." Xue Ziliang said with an innocent face.

"I know, I know. Your captured policy is very humane, very humane..." Guo Yi was no longer interested in this issue. He cared about how these bandits would dispose of them.

Not interrogating him anymore, maybe because they were satisfied with Xue Ziliang's confession, or maybe they felt they were useless... Guo Yi's hair stood on end. Looking at the satisfied Xue Ziliang, he was really carefree.

"Guo, are you afraid?" Xue Ziliang leaned over and asked.

Guo Yi wanted to maintain the heroic spirit of the Chinese people, but once speaking, he revealed the bottom: "A little... What do you think of this group of people?"

Xue Ziliang fished out a cigarette from his inner pocket. The lighter was taken away. He could only smell it under his nose and said: "I think they have no malice."

"?"

"There is a very strange thing," Xue Ziliang put away his smiling expression, "The person who interrogated us just now kept trying to make us believe..." He lowered his voice, "Now is 1628."

"What?!" Guo Yi didn't believe his ears - saying such absurd words?

"Very strange, right. At first I thought he was crazy. But Salina said he wasn't crazy, absolutely mentally normal." To strengthen persuasion, "Salina has a master's degree in psychology. She can tell if a person is crazy."

"Not necessarily. For example, MLM..." Guo Yi realized this example was not good. Americans hardly understood MLM business with Chinese characteristics, "For example, cult organizations. Psychiatrically speaking, they are not crazy either..."

Xue Ziliang nodded: "Right. I feel this organization has a bit of a cult flavor."

Cult is not the scope of Little Guo's business, but being in the same institution, he still has this basic common sense.

"But they don't have cult characteristics... like a leader, or totem symbols and such things."

"Do you know there is an underground organization called the Survival Church?"

"Survival Church?"

"Yes, this is an underground organization of unknown origin. Reserving large amounts of materials, building fortifications to survive nuclear war or other catastrophes sufficient to destroy normal social order... By the way, their leader seems to be called Vincent. Always advocating doomsday theory, advocating survivalists to be prepared."

"Advocating the end of the world is also a characteristic of cults." Little Guo remembered.

"Remember the cargo list we saw? Those things, too many and complex for trade, but what if for the need of rebuilding civilization?"

"You mean?!"

"Hmm, I suspect there is a huge scam here." Xue Ziliang said word by word, "Someone fabricated a new world."
