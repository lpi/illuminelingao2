# Chapter 120 - East Gate Market

Led by Chu Yu, Wu De and his men quickly found this secret cabinet. It was inlaid behind the wainscoting, fitting seamlessly. Even looking closely, one couldn't spot any flaw. Chu Yu didn't know where the opening mechanism was, and the transmigrators were too lazy to find it. Wang Ruixiang found a fire axe and chopped away with crackling sounds, quickly hacking a gap in the paneling.

Unexpectedly, once the cabinet was opened, they surprisingly discovered the master of the Gou family—Gou Xunyi. He was hiding in the secret cabinet of this study. Behind this paneling was a staircase leading down to an underground secret room. Inside were five red sandalwood cabinets, all locked. There were also several vats of clear water and a lot of dry food in the room, seemingly enough to support him for ten days or half a month. Gou Xunyi's captured appearance was much better than Saddam's; although trembling all over, he wasn't too disheveled.

Gou Xunyi tried hard to be calm, but he was shaking so much he couldn't stand steadily. A local tyrant and evil gentry like him usually lorded it over his own turf. Except for showing slight courtesy to county officials and gentry, he was simply a local emperor, killing and arson without blinking an eye. Now captured alive and knowing his enemies had come, he immediately lost his spirit. He originally wanted to say a few words of pleading, but they were stuck in his throat and couldn't come out.

Several people originally thought this local tyrant who summoned wind and rain in the county and colluded with pirates was some heroic figure. Seeing him like this, they felt contempt. Wu De ordered people to drag him to the mass meeting and took a few meticulous people himself to smash open the locks on the red sandalwood cabinets one by one. Inside were indeed various account books, contracts, receipts, and the like, as well as many letters tied in bundles with fine strings. Everyone was not interested in these things but knew that since he hid them here so solemnly, they must be important items. This was not the place to organize them, so they decided to haul them back for experts to handle. There were several other large chests in the secret room, three of which contained Spanish silver dollars. Shiny white, totaling more than ten thousand taels. There were two other small chests containing valuables like gold and jewelry. One item caught Wu De's attention: a plastic compact mirror—wasn't this what President Wen sold in large quantities to this time and space back then—as for where Gou the Elder got this one, it was unknown.

Gou the Elder's fate had long been decided. At the meeting deciding to attack Gou Family Stockade, the Gou family's fate was "death penalty." Originally, the question of whether to kill the whole family caused a debate. Although the resolution to kill them all was passed reluctantly in the end, many people still muttered and felt disgusted. Now it was good; Gou the Elder's whole family was either dead or fled, leaving him a commander without an army, saving people from conscience qualms. As for killing Gou the Elder, no one would feel sad.

Gou Xunyi was escorted onto the stage. The crowd below let out angry shouts, "Kill him! Kill him!" Obviously, the atmosphere laid by the transmigrators earlier played a role. For a time, the crowd below was excited. Xi Yazhou winked at Gou Buli. This gentleman immediately understood, picked up soil clods and garbage, and threw them at Gou Xunyi. The power of example is infinite. Immediately following were countless bricks and stones smashing over like rain. The transmigrators had dodged long ago. How could Gou the Elder, tied like a zongzi (sticky rice dumpling), dodge? Just like this, amidst a noisy clamor, the once-rampant Gou Xunyi was smashed bloody and died on the spot. When his bloody and fleshy head was held high by Zhang Xingjiao, dancing wildly on the stage like an Indian, the masses fell into a frenzy of revenge and bloodlust. Many Gou family members who usually had public anger or grudges were dragged down from the stage and beaten to death alive with punches and kicks. The transmigrators surrounded the area, and many felt extremely uncomfortable.

Smarter people had vaguely guessed the meaning of the Executive Committee adopting this method of inciting the masses to engage in terror: this was the best petition of allegiance for the villagers of the past Gou Family Stockade, now Damei Village. From now on, they had no choice but to be firmly tied to the war chariot of the transmigrators.

While this cruel farce was being staged, Wu De had already left the scene. He needed to discuss the transportation and distribution of materials with Dai Xie, who was responsible for confiscating materials.

The Gou family residence in Damei Village would be completely demolished, and the dismantled bricks, tiles, and timber would be used as building materials. As for Damei Village, fifty households would be left to farm according to the land's carrying capacity. Other households and various craftsmen would all be moved to Bairen City to serve as a directly controlled population. The remaining common people would establish grassroots organizations like the village committee and militia following the model of Salt Field Village.

Dai Xie was busy as a bee here. Besides things to be transported back to Bairen City, some had to be appropriately left for relieving local villagers. As for a large amount of furniture, daily necessities, clothes, and such items, they were all taken out to distribute to the common people. He discussed with Xi Yazhou: some suggested letting the people take them themselves, but the result of doing so would be that only the bold and strong would benefit. The timid and weak, even if they grabbed things, would often have them snatched away by others, or even be injured by the strong. Therefore, this distribution was uniformly arranged and distributed by the Planning Committee.

After arranging everything, Wu De led the main force and materials to evacuate Damei Village first. Xi Yazhou remained there; he still had to help establish the grassroots regime locally. Zhang Xingjiao recommended several people close to him to be leaders: one was named Ma Bangping, a small peddler who was slightly literate; another was originally a tenant of the Gou family named Jin Changman, about forty years old. Both had some prestige in the village. Gou Buli also wanted to get a position in the newly established village committee, but Xi Yazhou knew this person was unreliable and sent him directly into the immigrant team.

The work of transporting Gou Family Stockade's property and moving personnel lasted for almost half a month. During this period, the engineering team organized manpower and machinery to open up the road from Bairen City to the county town. Even the observation post originally set on the hill outside the city was openly established—a three-story all-brick blockhouse was built on the hill in a grand manner. Standing on top of the blockhouse, one could use high-power binoculars to see the details of the master in the county office trying cases and spanking buttocks. Combined with the PHS phone, it could simply do a live broadcast.

Lingao County was completely playing deaf and dumb this time, letting them engage in massive construction across the Wenlan River. The residents of the county were already accustomed to these roaring steel monsters. Although no one dared to approach these engineering machines yet, every time the machines started, many people watched from a distance. Even some wealthy gentry simply sat on sedan chairs, bringing wives, concubines, children, and many servants, built sheds on small earth mounds far away, put a few rattan chairs, and drank tea while watching their construction, as if watching a peep show.

For the common people, the changes didn't stop there. More and more farmers came to the market outside Bairen City. The transmigrators' extremely vigorous appetite attracted a large number of nearby farmers. At first, it was just a chicken, a duck, a few jin of eggs, or a load of vegetables. Later, it was a few bolts of cloth woven by women themselves, and later a pig... The transmigrators cheated neither old nor young, and the prices given were slightly higher than the general market price. Moreover, the payments were all in good coins from before the Tianqi era. This made everyone flock to it like ducks, and more and more people came.

This was beside the couch of the short-hairs, and the short-hairs' power was known to all. Not to mention bandits and robbers from various places, even the government runners from the county dared not come casually. Without anyone causing trouble, the place was peaceful. Plus, this year's autumn harvest was passable, showing a slight scene of peace. With more people coming, some set up sheds and stoves in the market, selling vegetarian food and tea, and also providing accommodation at night. Sellers who made money also wanted to buy things back, so peddlers selling rouge, powder, household utensils, farm tools, and the like also gathered. Then came fortune tellers and letter writers. In the last few days, Wu Nanhai discovered several women with heavy makeup during his patrol—prostitutes also came. Wu Nanhai was overwhelmed with emotions for a moment and almost shed tears—our market has finally taken shape!

In less than a month, a large area of bamboo sheds magically rose on the originally empty ground outside the East Gate. Although in terms of scale and popularity, it couldn't compare with a market in a remote township in the 21st century, for the commercial department of the transmigrators, this was already a very good achievement.

On the edge of this large area of humble sheds, near the moat outside the East Gate, a two-story building entirely of red brick structure was built, standing out like a crane among chickens. This was the newly built Bairen City East Gate Market Management Office, and also the office location of the Executive Committee's commercial department. In front of the small building was a corridor for shade and shelter from rain. In the main hall at the entrance, a stone platform was set up, displaying three different weighing instruments. A set of mass weighing instruments: stone weights of one kilogram, fifty grams, and one gram; a one-meter-long ruler; and a water pot of one liter when filled.

Promoting new weights and measures was an important task for the commercial department. Although the practice of unifying weights and measures started from Qin Shi Huang, in reality, weights and measures were never truly unified in ancient society. Every industry and every region, although using the same weight and measure names, were different in substance, some even varying greatly. This not only caused many disputes and contradictions but also allowed officials and unscrupulous merchants of past dynasties to profit from it. The commercial department decided to start promoting the standard weights and measures system of modern society from the East Gate Market, which had not yet taken shape at this time and place. All purchases and sales by transmigrators in the East Gate Market were measured and priced according to this new set of weights and measures. As for transactions between natives, since they didn't have enough new weighing instruments to supply the market for the time being, no rigid regulations were made.
