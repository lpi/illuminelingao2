# Chapter 127 - Trip to Guangzhou (3)

Xiao Zishan instructed Sun Chang to prepare mule carts and sedan chairs to go to the wharf to pick up people. Others hurried to cook and clean, making the empty residence suddenly busy. Sun Chang said there was no need to labor over mules and carts; just go directly to Qiwei Escort Agency—because of the need for escorting goods, escort agencies generally set up mule and horse cart "outer counters" (tertiary industry), having everything ready-made.

While arranging to pick up people, he also ordered a sedan chair to be prepared to visit Gao Ju. On the way, he asked Sun Chang about the movements in various aspects over the past year. Sun Chang said that since they left, Gao Ju also often sent people to deliver some things, asking if there was any news of the Australian maritime merchants. The neighborhood was peaceful. Except for Liu Laoxiang making trouble at the Pearl River Estuary causing some disturbance in the market, there were no major events. He didn't know much about official circles, only that a big official in the palace fell in Beijing, and there were some changes in the official circles of Guangzhou City, but he couldn't explain the rest clearly.

Xiao Zishan knew this so-called big official in the palace was Wei Zhongxian. History did not change its trajectory in this time and space: the once-powerful Nine Thousand Years had committed suicide in an inn at the south gate of Fucheng County, Hebei, on the sixth day of the eleventh lunar month last year. From December of last year to the first half of this year, Emperor Chongzhen was thoroughly investigating the remnants of the Wei faction, so the shock in official circles was not surprising. To a certain extent, the transmigrators should thank this situation: with people in panic, no one had the heart to deal with a pirate invasion on Hainan Island.

Xiao Zishan's sudden visit surprised and delighted Gao Ju. Regarding the matter of building a living shrine for Wei Zhongxian, he had no good plan, so he used the "delay" tactic taught by Shopkeeper Wen. Initially, this shopkeeper clearly said there would be a big change that month. Sure enough: Eunuch Yang originally sat in Guangzhou, urging at the mansion almost every day. Gao Ju dared not delay too much, just prepared slowly, enduring for about twenty days. Suddenly, Little Eunuch Yang came to bid farewell, ordering to suspend the construction of the living shrine, and hurriedly returned to Beijing with various prepared Australian goods. This dumbfounded Gao Ju. After another ten days or so, he received a letter from Beijing, only then learning: On May 18th, the Emperor suddenly fell ill, and the situation was very serious. Now Gao Ju was not just surprised, but felt a chill on the back of his head and goosebumps.

"May 18th, changes in the capital, things can be delayed." This was what Shopkeeper Wen said when bidding farewell. Checking against the present, this group of already somewhat mysterious maritime merchants seemed even more unpredictable to him. He hurriedly sent people around to inquire, asking if anyone had seen strange large ocean-going ships? But there was no news. He had to give up hope, waiting wholeheartedly for the maritime merchants to come to him—after all, there was still a payment of two hundred thousand taels of silver here. Waiting left and right for more than a year without news, just when he felt hopeless, he heard some rumors in the last month: saying an unprecedented giant ship appeared in Qiongzhou. The sailors on the ship all had short hair and short clothes, very fierce. He couldn't help muttering in his heart: Could this be the ship of the Australian maritime merchants? He was pondering whether to send someone to inquire locally.

While ordering people to set up a banquet to welcome them, Gao Ju asked after their well-being. He brought the sales list of goods, telling him that fifty thousand taels of silver could be withdrawn right now, and the rest would be gathered in ten days or so.

"No hurry for silver; it can be deposited with Shopkeeper Gao first." The transmigrators didn't lack silver now; they lacked materials. Xiao Zishan didn't stand on ceremony too much, telling him the purpose of this trip was to purchase goods. Because the variety of goods was complex, he asked Shopkeeper Gao for much help. Gao Ju thought it was still the past porcelain, spices, and hardwoods, and agreed readily. When he opened the list to look, he was dumbfounded. The items listed were completely unexpected: pig iron, graphite, fluorite, chalcanthite, alum, copperas (green vitriol), saltpeter, mirabilite, soda ash, sulfur, arsenic, realgar, orpiment, cinnabar, borax, gypsum, tin, lead, copper, mercury...

Gao Ju didn't recognize most of these things himself. Some he knew were used in workshops, and some were simply medicinal materials. Saltpeter and sulfur were government-controlled items. Pig iron was asked for ten thousand shi at the start. This was easier to say, just running to more iron fields. But mercury was also asked for ten shi—even if all the mercury in Guangzhou City was collected, there probably wouldn't be one shi—what did they want these for? Did some emperor or noble die in Australia, needing mercury for preservation?

While thinking wildly, Xiao Zishan saw his face changing uncertainly and asked: "Are there difficulties with these?"

"Things can be found." Gao Ju put down the list, "Just, isn't the quantity a bit too much? Take this chalcanthite and mercury for example; having one shi in the whole city would be good, where to find so much."

"Then please trouble Master Gao. We want as much as there is." Xiao Zishan didn't know what these things were used for either, but since they were named items to buy, they must be crucial.

"Brother entrusts Brother (me) to handle things, naturally I will do my best," Gao Ju suddenly changed the address, lowering his voice, "However, there are many prohibited items inside. Not that Brother (I) can't handle it, just asking beforehand to easily grasp the propriety when handling things."

Xiao Zishan was stunned. He knew saltpeter and sulfur might be government-controlled items, but hadn't thought about others: "Don't know which are prohibited goods?"

"Iron, this item is forbidden for export. But this is still easy. It's copper, arsenic, saltpeter, and sulfur that have some difficulties, especially since Brother wants such a particularly large amount—"

"These are all raw materials for Australian goods." Xiao Zishan already knew from Sun Chang: Gao Ju made a fortune on Australian goods, becoming a "wealth myth" in Guangzhou City. Using raw materials for making Australian goods as a reason, he would definitely do his best. However, this was also the honest truth: the Ministry of Industry urgently needed these things to start modern manufacturing.

Sure enough, Gao Ju immediately fell silent, seeming to weigh something. After a moment, as if making up his mind, he said: "Since Brother wants them, Brother (I) will definitely help. It just takes time to prepare goods. How long can Brother wait?"

"Fifteen days."

"A bit tight. I'll ask subordinate shopkeepers to split up and purchase. Try our best to arrange! Don't know where the goods are to be transported? Is it still—"

"This matter, have to ask Brother for advice." Another purpose of Xiao Zishan's trip was to establish a transportation line from Guangzhou to Hainan. Large-scale purchasing would also be conducted in Guangzhou in the future, urgently needing a suitable transfer point. There were many people and eyes in the city, making large-scale entry and exit of goods very inconvenient. Therefore, a warehouse outside the city was needed as a place for goods transfer.

He told Gao Ju his request. Gao Ju said this was easy. He had his own warehouse and wharf on Youyuzhou at the Pearl River Estuary—that was the territory of fishermen specializing in smuggling, all semi-civilian and semi-bandit characters. Government runners in the city dared not enter easily; it was almost a world outside the law. The transmigrators' ship could dock there. He would allocate a separate warehouse for goods turnover.

"This is very good." Xiao Zishan was quite satisfied with this arrangement, then told Gao Ju that their acquisition of these goods was long-term. As long as they could be acquired, they wanted as much as available.

After the plan was settled, Gao Ju asked if any new Australian goods arrived in Guangzhou this time. Xiao Zishan just smiled slightly, "Those are just small gadgets. In a few months, Brother will naturally see and know."

These words gave Gao Ju infinite room for imagination but also left him with some fear. From a personal perspective, he was not afraid of this short-hair in front of him, but the vaguely powerful force behind the other party made him uneasy. This group of Australian maritime merchants was definitely not as simple as merchants.

The next person Xiao Zishan visited was Shopkeeper Sun Kecheng of Qiwei Escort Agency. The escort agency had the ability to transport bulk materials over long distances and was a good helper for establishing land transportation lines.

Along the way, Sun Wei had told the master the details of the escort agency thoroughly. This was an escort agency combined by family, fellow villager, and master-disciple relationships. From the chief escort Sun Kecheng down to the small clerks and grooms at the counter, they were either of the same clan, same village, or fellow disciples and brothers. The regional, blood, and patriarchal relationships between them were extremely close. They specialized in the route from Guangzhou to Nanchang, Jiangxi, and also did short-distance trips within the province. There were multiple outer counter branches along the way. It was considered medium-scale in Guangdong Province, having some connections in all aspects. Xiao Zishan calculated that if he could control this escort agency, it would be of great benefit to trade and intelligence activities in Guangdong.

Shopkeeper Sun was quite happy about his visit—Australian maritime merchants were indeed people who valued friendship. Xiao Zishan presented some gifts again, and both sides talked happily. Xiao Zishan took the opportunity to ask about the escort agency's business.

Sun Kecheng sighed repeatedly, and his face darkened a lot.

The escort business was not bad. It was just that the journey was becoming less and less peaceful. In the past, there were many bandits on the road, but they were figures with names in the Jianghu (underworld/martial arts world), more or less abiding by Jianghu rules. In the past two years, it became the world of wandering bandits and roving rebels. They were either desperate farmers or deserters who couldn't get paid. These two groups of people didn't care about your trade name or rules at all, robbing whatever they saw and killing whoever they met. Past bandits only wanted valuables, gold, and silver. The roving rebels encountered now simply wanted everything, goods and carts included.

With bandits running rampant, every village and town along the way built militia corps and set up stockades everywhere. Passing through villages and towns required interrogation and guarding everywhere. For an outside escort agency like them, if not for the master and disciples basically being of Jiangxi origin and having some human relations, it would be difficult even to find a place to stay and eat. They managed to make a few trips barely, although no goods were lost, a dozen brothers were killed or injured. Everyone in the escort agency felt the future was unpredictable.

When Xiao Zishan proposed to fund them by buying shares and opening new escort routes at the same time, Sun Kecheng's mouth opened wide—since the beginning of the escort business, escort agencies were never a money-making business. Several brothers could start a business by joining together and raising a flag, earning money by selling strength and risking lives. Making a decent living throughout the year was possible, but big dividends were absolutely non-existent. Therefore, no one ever invested money in shares for the escort agency business.

"No dividends." Xiao Zishan then proposed his idea, "Now we want to do business and open firms in the Great Ming. Transporting goods while sitting in the shop is indispensable. No one is more familiar with this land and water transportation than your line. With this money, first, we don't want dividends from the escort agency; second, we don't interfere with the internal affairs of the escort agency. It's just that wherever our business firms reach in the future, the escort routes of the escort agency must also reach there!"
