# Chapter 133: Ziming Tower

A good idea meant rolling wealth—everyone's eyes instantly showed more white than black.

"Regarding procurement—we still don't know what Guangzhou has. But as a major trade-hub, available goods must be plentiful. My thought: procure as many upgradable primary-products as possible in Guangzhou."

Zhang Xin's proposal was essentially: purchase primary-products, export finished-goods—the classic international-trade exploitation-method. Using Guangzhou as base, bulk-purchase baijiu, tobacco, pig-iron, cotton-cloth, raw-silk, crude-sugar, timber—these semi-processed goods. Process them in Lingao into high-grade industrial-products for export—earning scissors-differential. Much faster and more economical than building complete agricultural-and-industrial systems from scratch.

"Didn't Xiao Bailang say we have Zentraedi-level technology? Since our technology far exceeds theirs, we shouldn't focus on low-level manufacturing." Zhang Xin continued. "In my view—including the current lumber-yard—Lingao isn't timber-rich. But Guangdong-Fujian forestry remains thriving even in the 21st century. Why not procure timber here? With timber, we can mass-produce paper. Days ago, Guo Yi and I checked markets—writing-paper is expensive. Bulk-quantities move fast."

"There's a shipping-capacity issue." Xiao Zishan considered. "Diesel reserves are limited—must conserve. Shipbuilding lacks experience; dockyards need major infrastructure."

Zhang Xin smiled, shaking his head: "I don't mean to say Committee's disconnected from the masses—" Except for Guo Yi, everyone nodded. "Sometimes you're inflexible—determined to manufacture everything yourselves. Even toilet-paper you tried producing yourselves—result? You don't know men with wives and girlfriends are using dry leaves to conserve toilet-paper?"

"Such things are happening? Toilet-paper supply isn't problematic." Xiao Zishan, as Internal-Affairs commissioner, knew toilet-paper—seemingly trivial—greatly affected quality-of-life. Shortages could damage morale. Pre-transmigration stockpiling and post-D-Day distribution were tightly managed—calculated daily, distributed weekly. But self-production remained incomplete.

"Commissioner Xiao—having and having-enough are different." Zhang Xin shook his head helplessly. "Men with women nearby naturally sacrifice a bit." His view was simple: "Buy ships, don't build!"

"Buy ships? Guangdong sand-junks?"

"I don't know what sand-junks are—" Zhang Xin waved. "But Guangdong's timber resources are abundant, many maritime-merchants—shipbuilding must be developed. We can order ships here—solve immediate needs."

Indeed, *Deng Yingzhou's* tonnage was too small. As Qiong-Yue maritime-transport scaled up, capacity-expansion was imperative. Build or buy?—this question, like the old timespace, had sparked internal-Committee debate. Industrialists insisted on building—whether wooden, iron, or cement ships—accumulating experience, training workers. Commercial-Trade advocated buying—quickly expanding capacity.

Final result: purchasing *Deng Yingzhou*—buy-faction slightly prevailing. Reason: Industrialists also urgently needed mainland raw-materials. Self-building required months before launch, lacking many materials.

But *Deng Yingzhou's* commissioning hadn't eliminated fundamental-disagreements. Build-faction argued: after initial small-boat trade, once industrial-capacity increased, shipbuilding could begin—*Deng Yingzhou* was transitional. Buy-faction argued: short-term industrial-focus on shipbuilding was counterproductive—buying should continue and intensify.

How to reconcile these factions gave Xiao Zishan headaches. Personally, both made sense—buying and building were both urgent. But how to explain this?

Sudden inspiration: "Guangzhou Forward Station essentially equals a subsidiary. Production-capital like ships—subsidiaries can self-invest."

Rather than proposing "buy-don't-build" at Committee—triggering debate round-two—let Guangzhou Station solve it themselves.

"Decide ourselves?" Guo Yi couldn't believe his ears.

"Yes, you decide." Xiao Zishan graciously patted his shoulder. Guangzhou Station—isolated on mainland, bearing trade-and-intelligence responsibilities—had complex, numerous affairs. Committee shouldn't micromanage. Moreover, multiple departments were involved—remote-control meant unclear command-authority.

"Also—how to handle Gao Ju's interests?" Yan Maoda worried. "Previously, he was our distributor. Now we're opening direct-retail—he'll be unhappy."

"Didn't you say when discussing the jewelry-house—we'd operate non-overlapping lines? Glassware—let him handle."

"Problem is he'll request Committee let him distribute too? Merchants are greedy." Guo Yi worried.

"We're wholesalers—let him do retail. Retail is hard—needs local merchants." Zhang Xin said.

"Segment channels." Xiao Zishan pondered, explaining his thinking.

"Channel-segmentation?!" Zhang Xin and Yan Maoda understood—but had doubts. Channel-marketing only emerged in China during the 1990s.

"I know what you're thinking—but my channel-marketing concept isn't complex. Two-track approach." He elaborated.

Gao Ju, as Australian-goods agent, had opened Guangzhou's luxury-market. He possessed local-connections transmigrators lacked. So luxury-goods could use agency-model: mainly glassware—mirrors, drinkware, tea-sets. Glass had endless uses; new-products could flow continuously.

Salt, sugar, iron-products, soap, cigarettes—as mass-consumption goods—were low-priced, high-volume. Use trading-house wholesale: letting small-and-medium merchants and peddlers distribute. Additionally, use Guangzhou and Macau as windows—organizing large-scale exports.

"That's good—" Zhang Xin's words were interrupted by a coquettish voice from outside: "Then where's my role?"

Everyone knew without turning: Special-Agent PEPI had arrived. Today she wore a blue Confucian-scholar robe—lips red, teeth white—alluringly beautiful yet radiating carefree elegance. Truly deserving her "hundred-transformations" reputation.

"Weren't you assigned to run Ziming Tower?" Guo Yi was somewhat displeased. She really knew how to make entrances. He couldn't help teasing: "With your skills—won't you dominate the scene, drive the city mad? Intelligence-gathering will be child's play."

"Ziming Tower is trivial." PEPI lightly flicked long sleeves—"not taking a single cloud" elegance. "Intelligence is trivial too. Creating Guangzhou's new fashion-era is the real matter."

Indeed! This person treated Forward Station as her personal performance-stage.

"Then go ahead and create—nobody's stopping you." Little Guo grew annoyed.

"Ah, what can I say about you men?" Miss P's eyes rippled—making everyone's skin crawl. "Fashion requires interconnected industry-chains. Ziming Tower leads trends and builds brand—but you need a fashion-boutique for material-support."

"Great idea!" Yan Maoda immediately supported. He'd already planned—using 21st-century materials and jewelry-industry expertise—opening a jewelry-house selling new-style pieces. If Miss P's Ziming Tower succeeded—it would be living advertisement. Excitedly he said: "I can design complete new-jewelry sets for Miss P! Watch—they'll sell massively!"

Guo Yi hesitated—unexpected proposal, but feasible—premise being Ziming Tower's success. He nodded: "I think it works!"

Xiao Zishan also agreed. Thus "Zizhen Studio" was settled. Guo Yi and Yan Maoda were raring to go—ready to deploy all their jewelry-company skills.

Radio clicked again—Industrial Committee this time—requesting Xiao Zishan recruit professional craftsmen in Guangzhou.

"Masons, carpenters, shipwrights—shipwrights?" Xiao Zishan puzzled: were they still starting a shipyard? "Potters, blacksmiths, coopers..."

A dozen trades listed. Xiao Zishan thought: indeed needed. Basic crafts, but mastering fundamental handwork-techniques.

This could go through Sun Kecheng. Xiao Zishan noted tasks in his notebook.

"Radio's become a treasure." Xiao Zishan smiled. "Lingao now has clairvoyance and clairaudience."

Guo Yi nodded: "Now if Guangdong plans punitive-expeditions, Committee knows immediately. One-way transparency."

"But intelligence-collection? How's Ming-era secrecy?"

"Though I'm not a Ming-history enthusiast—personally, maintaining secrecy in medieval-environments is very difficult." Guo Yi said. "Warfare involves grain, ships, troop-movements. Even in modern-war, these can't be completely concealed."

"Nevertheless—Ming has Brocade Guards and Eastern-Depot. Don't get complacent."

Everyone nodded gravely—those two agencies' terror echoed even four centuries later in another timespace.

"Our knowledge of these organizations' historical-status is limited." Xiao Zishan said. "But both Brocade Guards and Eastern-Depot surely have Guangzhou-personnel. Stay constantly vigilant. Avoid suspicion-arousing actions."

"We'll be careful."

"About the Capture-Protocol Manual—has everyone memorized it?"
