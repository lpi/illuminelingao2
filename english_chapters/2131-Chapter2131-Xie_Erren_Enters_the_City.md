# Chapter 2131 - Xie Erren Enters the City

Xie Erren's first impression of Wuzhou was very poor—truth be told, his perception of any large or medium city under Ming rule fell below the passing line; generally, they were "dirty, messy, and substandard." In contrast, some wealthy villages and small towns could still give him a fresh, artistic feeling.

Because Wuzhou had suffered from the fires of war, the condition in the city was even more unbearable: rubble and ash were everywhere, and refugees who had just returned to the city were stumbling over the ruins, scavenging for things. Wild dogs, which had been scared into hiding by the artillery fire, were attracted by the bloody smell of uncollected corpses on the streets and came out to scavenge, scurrying everywhere as they were shooed away by the able-bodied men guarding the streets.

Xie Erren, draped in a trench coat and surrounded by guards, walked swaggeringly down the street. At first, he strutted with the air of Zhukov recapturing Yelnya in *The Battle for Moscow*. However, seeing the miserable state of affairs and the gloomy faces of the citizens on the street, his mood suddenly soured. Being a leader in this place would likely be a tough job...

The Wuzhou Municipal Government was temporarily located in the Wuzhou Prefecture Yamen. As soon as Xie Erren arrived at the gate of the Yamen, he saw several soldiers leading some laborers noisily carrying out a few corpses wrapped in reed mats.

He stopped a naturalized citizen cadre who was directing nearby and asked, "Who are these corpses?"

"It's the Ming prefect of Wuzhou, named Hu Duhua. And a few petty officials," the naturalized cadre reported quickly, not knowing his background but seeing his appearance and the guards around him, guessing that a "Chief" had arrived. "They all committed suicide in the Yamen."

Xie Erren secretly cursed, "Bad luck"—why couldn't these people die somewhere else instead of committing suicide in the Yamen?

Naturally, as a believer in materialism—or rather, given that the majority of the Senate were materialists—Xie Erren absolutely could not reveal this emotion. Hearing that a prefect had died, he waved his hand lightly and said, "If he's dead, he's dead. What about his family?"

"The servants say he sent his family away long ago."

Xie Erren felt a slight regret—he thought of Dong Mingdang in Guangzhou.

*If I were Liu Xiang, I would definitely show some 'concern' for Miss Dong.*

Amidst his wandering thoughts, Xie Erren entered the prefectural office. The Planning Agency's confiscation team was "searching," and it was noisy everywhere. He had no interest in watching them dig three feet into the ground.

He arrived at the Second Hall, which was the place for trying civil cases. Now it had been converted into the city government conference room. Although called a conference room, it was more like a temporary office, bustling with naturalized cadres and soldiers coming in and out. Zhu Quanxing, in full military uniform, was speaking to a group of orderlies. After he finished a few sentences, an orderly would immediately stand at attention, salute, and leave, followed by the next one. It was extremely crisp and efficient. This made Xie Erren, who hadn't been able to come up with a single sentence after holding it in by the West River for half a day, feel both envious and jealous.

Seeing that Zhu Quanxing was busy, Xie Erren didn't want to disturb him, so he wandered around the Second Hall. He noticed several lines of ink written on the west wall. The handwriting was scribbled and dripping with ink. Interested, he walked over to look and saw it was a "death note":

> The Sage said: "I have heard of using the Xia to transform the barbarians, but never of being transformed by the barbarians." As an official of the Great Ming, how can I surrender to beasts and lose my integrity to steal a life? In my Hu family, there are no men who have committed crimes among the ancestors, and no women who have remarried among the kin. Since I have received the teachings of Confucius and Mencius and the grace of the State, to die for the affairs of the State is exactly my wish. For a subject, virtue lies in integrity. If a subject is unloyal, how is he different from a beast! Three years ago, He Zhen was defeated at Chengmai; my heart and gall were torn, and I bathed in tears for a whole year. However, the reason I endured and did not die was that I considered the integrity of one person small, but the vengeance of the State great. Now the bandit runts have overrun Guangzhou, Lingnan has collapsed, benevolence and righteousness are blocked, and beasts lead men to eat men. I estimate I cannot avoid falling to the bandits, but how can I be a turncoat official? Things have come to this; righteousness allows no further humiliation. I only wish for the Great Ming to display heavenly punishment and sweep away the swarm of clowns. Although I die today, it is as if I live in spirit.

"Who wrote this?" Xie Erren asked.

A surrendered clerk nearby hurriedly said, "This was inscribed by Prefect Master Hu—no, the puppet prefect Hu Duhua—before he committed suicide. Someone has already been sent to fetch lime water..."

Xie Erren subconsciously looked up at the roof beam; there was no rope. The clerk said, "Master Hu... the rebel Hu heard that the heavenly army had entered the city, bathed and changed clothes in the rear hall, then came here to write on the wall, closed the door, bowed to the north twice, and took poison in front of the public desk."

"Oh." Xie Erren nodded. "He had some backbone."

Looking again, there were two more death poems nearby, but the handwriting was different from Master Hu's. Although Xie Erren was a Chinese literature graduate, he didn't actually know much about poetry. He roughly understood the meaning but couldn't tell good from bad. He only knew they were definitely better than doggerel, but generally inferior to Tang poetry.

"This was inscribed by the rebel Hu's correspondence secretary, Mr. Xing..."

"Where is he?"

"Mr. Xing Chenghuan... no, the rebel Xing also committed suicide in the Second Hall."

"He was just a private secretary, not a court official with a duty to defend the soil. Why did he have to be buried with the Great Ming? Xiong Wencan lost Guangzhou and Zhaoqing, ran all the way here, and then slipped out of the city. Truly incomprehensible!" Hearing that the advisor had also committed suicide along with him, Xie Erren felt it was a bit baffled. *My Senate and Fubo Army wouldn't care about a mere prefect's advisor.*

"Yes, yes, it was just a momentary inability to think it through," the clerk sighed. "He was from Guangdong. I heard his family had just arranged a marriage for him. It's truly a pity."

"Very young?"

"In his early thirties. I heard he only passed the licentiate exam the year before last. His family was poor, so he came out to work as an aide—he had some family friendship with Master Hu. The two got along well as guest and host."

Xie Erren said a few words like "what a pity." He said these words intentionally, meaning to use Xing Chenghuan's "horse bones" to attract "thousand-li horses."

His affectation did put the surrendered officials at ease.

Over there, Zhu Quanxing finished arranging his work. Seeing Xie Erren had arrived, he hurriedly greeted him and led him to a side room to "discuss important matters."

"I will be leaving Wuzhou city very soon. The following matters will depend on you," Zhu Quanxing said.

"What?!" Xie Erren was startled. Wuzhou had just been taken, and order in various aspects had not yet been restored. As the garrison commander of Wuzhou, Zhu Quanxing was his military backbone here. If he left, how could Xie Erren, a person with zero military ability, ensure Wuzhou's safety?

"This... Wuzhou has just been taken, and the surrounding counties haven't been completely secured..."

Seeing that Xie Erren admired Lin Biao greatly and cosplayed his orders vividly, but actually knew very little about military affairs and certainly couldn't command a battle, Zhu Quanxing saw he was anxious as soon as he heard he was leaving.

"You're right," Zhu Quanxing said. "That is exactly why I need to lead the troops to capture the counties subordinate to Wuzhou. Only then can we quickly set up Wuzhou's defensive line."

"Isn't that Brigadier Zhu's job?"

"Zhu Mingxia can't attend to these things now..." Zhu Quanxing lowered his voice. "Just now, the brigade headquarters received a telegram. The situation in the Eight-Row Yao area is not good; it's very critical. Brigadier Zhu has to rush back to Zhaoqing to take charge centrally."

Although Xie Erren, as the Senator taking over Wuzhou, had read the background materials on the Eight-Row Yao Uprising of 1635 beforehand, he hadn't taken it seriously. He felt it was just a piece of historical data and didn't take it to heart—in his mind, the Fubo Army was an ever-victorious strong force and a stabilizing pillar invulnerable to all evils. As long as the army was there, no problem was too big. He hadn't expected to encounter this situation as soon as he took office!

Xie Erren understood the consequences of the Eight-Row Yao Uprising. Now that the troops' offensive momentum was good, Zhu Mingxia had to rush back, which fully illustrated the critical nature of the matter.

"You won't leave, will you..."

"I am the Garrison Commander of the Wuzhou area, of course I won't leave." Zhu Quanxing hurriedly cheered him up. "But I can't stay inside Wuzhou city without going out. The strategy for the areas surrounding Wuzhou will be executed as usual—only in this way can Wuzhou's safety be fully guaranteed."

"That's good." Xie Erren breathed a sigh of relief.

"Rest assured." Zhu Quanxing secretly laughed at Director Xie. "I've left you a company. The National Army's Wuzhou Squadron will arrive soon—expand it to battalion size as quickly as possible. The local militia must also be organized as soon as possible. Only then can Wuzhou's safety be guaranteed."

"As long as the National Army is here, Wuzhou will be fine! You go with peace of mind." Xie Erren probably felt that his nervousness just now was too undignified, so he hurriedly put on a "calm" attitude.

Once his heart settled, he felt he had indeed been worrying like the man of Qi worrying about the sky falling. With a company of regular troops plus a squadron of the National Army, defending Wuzhou city at a minimum level shouldn't be a problem.

"Who is the commander of the troops..."

Zhu Quanxing said, "The commander of this company is a veteran naturalized officer with a lot of experience in leading troops. He is also very reliable politically—you can trust him completely."

After giving his instructions, Zhu Quanxing called over the commander of the 7th Company of the Line Infantry, who was remaining in Wuzhou.

"This is Company Commander Captain Qian Duo," Zhu Quanxing introduced. "An officer from the old Peace Preservation Corps."

The original Bairen Peace Preservation Corps was the Senate's first armed force. This background was a resounding qualification in the Fubo Army. The first line of the military anthem of the 1st Infantry Battalion, which inherited the mantle of the Bairen Peace Preservation Corps, was "Gloriously founding the army, before the Bairen Beach." Soldiers who joined the Peace Preservation Corps back then, as long as they hadn't died in battle or retired, had all grown into officers now. Regardless of their military skill level, at least their qualifications and loyalty were unquestionable.

Qian Duo snapped to attention and saluted. Xie Erren nodded, but his heart was still a bit uneasy: this Qian Duo was short, dark, and plain-looking. Could he shoulder the heavy responsibility of Wuzhou's garrison?

Seemingly sensing Xie Erren's unease, Zhu Quanxing added, "Captain Qian not only has seniority, but his service experience is also very rich. He has participated in many major military operations. His military and political qualities are first-rate."

Qian Duo stood at attention again: "Thank you for the compliment, Chief! I guarantee to complete all tasks assigned by the Senate!"

Xie Erren nodded: "The work of Wuzhou's city defense will depend entirely on you."
