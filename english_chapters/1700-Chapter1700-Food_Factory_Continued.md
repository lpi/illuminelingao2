# Chapter 1700 - Food Factory (Continued)

"The quality of these is comparatively poorer." Yun Suji weighed his words, "The meat used isn't that, um... decent."

As for what was meant by not so "decent," the stuff used could be imagined. Roughly the same path as roadside stall bun fillings in the old timeline, collectively called "scrap meat." Blood neck was considered good; there was heavens know what else. After Yun Suji became the food factory director, he fully sensed why German sausage claims that 'not a single drop of blood is wasted.'

"Let's go quickly." Xi Yazhou's appetite suddenly wasn't so good. Chen Sigen, however, was interested and asked: "Is the dry sausage prepared for supplying the troops of this kind? I think it's still not bad in nutritional indicators."

"Which specific sausage to supply the troops depends on the troops' needs and Joint Logistics' procurement quotation. Of course, it also depends on raw material supply—meat supply has always been a pit."

"Old Yun, just confess honestly, exactly how many kinds of meat are in this so-called sausage?" Xi Yazhou frowned.

"Theoretically any meat works, even... and guaranteed you can't taste it." Yun Suji laughed heh-heh, "No joking. Pig, cow, sheep, horse, donkey, mule, fish, chicken, duck, goose, I've used them all here. Of course including animal organs and blood."

"Can it be customized?" Chen Sigen asked.

"Yes. Different raw material proportions can be adjusted in the sausage filling based on procurement price and raw material supply situation. The simplest adjustment is the starch content."

"I think we can order more ham sausages. Looks like meat, tastes like it has meat flavor too..."

"No, ham sausage is meaningless. Because the main component is still starch, just with some more grease." Chen Sigen denied categorically, "Now we need to supplement soldiers with more protein."

"If meat supply is sufficient, we can directly produce Indian meat cakes [Pemmican]. This thing is very simple to produce."

"What is Indian meat cake?"

"I know, it's the so-called pemmican," Chen Sigen had been in the United States for many years and knew this. "It's said to be invented by Indians, using North American bison meat roasted dry and ground, then mixed with grease, ground nuts, and such things to make into blocks. Later white people also learned to make it. This stuff is actually quite good, high fat high protein, durable for storage."

"Isn't that raw meat?"

"It's all roasted dry, how can it be raw meat? But as instant food, I guess it's very untasty. It should taste not bad after cooking."

"Pity there isn't that much meat." Xi Yazhou sighed.

"If we want to implement cheap and big bowl, and still have enough protein. We can consider fish sausages. Follow me."

The next production line was the fish sausage production line, called "surimi products" in the food industry. The product line had a wide variety; fish balls, fish cakes, fish paste, chikuwa, crab sticks, etc., all belonged to this category.

Upon entering the surimi workshop, a strong fishy stench was smelled; it could be smelled even wearing masks. In the open space were baskets of various sea fish transported from the marine product processing factory. Workers wearing work clothes were busy moving raw materials and finished products. The water vapor was heavy in the workshop.

"Surimi products generally use trash fish with poor economy and low grade," Yun Suji introduced the raw material fish in the baskets, "But only white meat fish can be used, and fish meat fat cannot be too much."

Chen Sigen and Xi Yazhou looked at baskets of various large and small fish, feeling dazzled. Seeing the last row neatly piled on straw mats along the wall, they recognized the fish: sharks.

Speaking of which, there were quite a few shark varieties here, at least seven or eight kinds big and small.

"Can shark be eaten? I remember this thing excretes urine through its whole body, and the fish meat just smells of urine..." Chen Sigen had been abroad for many years and was knowledgeable. He recalled the terrifying experience of locals treating him to the local specialty fermented shark when he went to Norway back then.

"Because it's not tasty, it's used to make surimi products."

Shark meat contains relatively much urea and has a strong urine smell, so directly beating it into paste won't do. Therefore, the first step is to dismember it into fillets, rinse with 5% salt water for five minutes, then put into acetic acid solution tanks to soak for deodorization after washing clean, and finally rinse clean and air dry the moisture.

"This is the processed shark fillet. Smell it, no smell at all." Yun Suji casually picked up a piece of white fish meat and handed it to Chen Sigen, "This can be used to beat paste."

They continued forward. Ahead, a machine was running with a rumble. A worker was pouring a basket of fish down from the funnel. Below was a huge stainless steel drum covered with dense holes. Many remains of fish, already squeezed into mush but still roughly recognizable as fish, were rolling on it.

"What is this doing, beating paste?"

"This is meat picking, or squeezing meat. The holes on this big drum are sieves. Through continuous rotation and squeezing, fish bones and fish skin are excluded, leaving only pure meat."

"Damn, really advanced!" Xi Yazhou entered a food factory for the first time and was very curious. He stared at this machine for a long time, "Doesn't this mean the problem of spitting out fish bones when eating fish isn't a problem in the factory?"

"If not pursuing the integrity of fish and the texture of fish meat, there are many mechanical methods to remove fish bones." Yun Suji said, "Otherwise, how can it be said that the power of industry is infinite."

Chen Sigen suddenly shouted: "Not right, this isn't sea fish, it's catfish!"

"Correct, it's catfish." Yun Suji said. He said catfish are very common in Guangdong and Hainan. Among the rice-fish culture promoted by the Heaven and Earth Society, there is catfish farming—mainly Walking Catfish and Large-mouth Catfish. They grow very fast, have low requirements for living water quality, and tolerate low oxygen. The disadvantage is the meat quality is not very good. But it produces much meat and has no troublesome intermuscular bones to deal with. The food factory takes it to use as filler for surimi products.

"I remember this thing has a strong muddy smell."

"Just raise it in clear water for a few days. Besides, there is post-processing. Even shark meat can be used, let alone this."

After meat picking is completed, the fish meat is poured into a meat grinder and continuously ground two or three times with a spiral cutter. Then several kinds of ground fish meat are poured into a large stone mortar. The worker engaged the clutch, and the belt began to drive a machine to stir and beat paste with three stirring rods. The stirring rods were controlled by planetary gears and could rotate and revolve. It could easily stir a large amount of minced fish meat into surimi.

Yun Suji said: "This is a Silent Cutter [Leikuiji/Stone Mortar Grinder]. Specially used to beat paste for surimi. Manual work is also possible, but efficiency is naturally far worse."

While he spoke, a worker held a spoon and continuously ladled a little water into the stone mortar.

"This is salt water, which can increase the viscosity of surimi. Adding salt is the key to making surimi products."

Seeing the surimi becoming stickier with stirring, feeling stickier than kneaded dough, the worker added some cooking wine and seasonings during the period. He also poured in a bag of white powder.

"This is sweet potato starch, also a filler. Generally not exceeding 25%. However, based on procurement price, 50% or even higher can be added, or none at all. By the way, the surimi products supplied by this factory to special supply shops have absolutely no addition."

"I think adding 25% for military use is enough; adding more is meaningless." Chen Sigen said, "How to preserve? Things like chikuwa have to be refrigerated."

"Preserved in a similar way to sausages: cooked, dried, smoked."

Next, they looked at the dried fish and fish floss workshops. Yun Suji expressed that these could all be listed as military food. He especially recommended various roasted dried fish. Suggested carrying them as portable rations.

"What about dried meat?"

"Very easy to make, I have finished products too." Yun Suji said, "Can also make products like dried pork slices."

"No, no, can't make it too delicious, otherwise soldiers will eat it as snacks." Xi Yazhou shook his head, "Must be easy to swallow, but shouldn't be delicious."

Originally Yun Suji wanted to take them to other workshops, but the two who had suffered enough visual and olfactory torture didn't want to increment their knowledge anymore. Yun Suji had to take them to the Product R&D Institute.

The Product R&D Institute was actually also a workshop, just much smaller in scale, containing all kinds of small processing equipment. Yun Suji took them directly through the corridor to a large room at the back.

Against the wall in the room was a row of heavy gas refrigerators and display cabinets. Inside were all kinds of food.

"These are all trial products, products that our current production level can manufacture." Yun Suji opened a cabinet and took out a paper box. "This is experimental military biscuit. You guys taste it."

The biscuits were small blocks, very hard. Xi Yazhou knew military biscuits were generally baked relatively dry to facilitate preservation. The disadvantage was one had to drink a large amount of water when eating. He took a bite; the texture was extremely hard. After chewing a few times, there was the aroma of sesame; it seemed sugar and salt were added. Not bad to eat, and not as hard to chew as imagined.

"I think it's not bad." Chen Sigen said, "The taste is okay."

"That's just it." Yun Suji said, "Many things can't be made without wheat flour. Actually, quite a lot of rice flour is mixed in here."

Yun Suji said that besides rice flour, potato flour, sesame, and hops were also added to the biscuits. Preservation and palatability were both not bad.

"The stuff is not bad, pity it has no value if it can't be mass-produced." Xi Yazhou said, "What other good stuff do you have?"

Chen Sigen said: "Can be issued in small amounts to scouts; they need this kind of food."

Yun Suji pointed to a glass display cabinet: "These are the dehydrated vegetable series. All can be used as military non-staple food."

The varieties could be called rich and colorful. Chen Sigen saw at a glance more than ten varieties like cabbage, white radish strips, carrot strips and slices, eggplant, potato, cowpea, pumpkin, lotus root, spinach, calabash, etc.

"Pity we still can't do low-temperature vacuum drying now. This will make do. Of course, the nutritional value is far worse. Dehydrated vegetables are light in weight and easy to preserve. Better than bringing pickles and salted vegetables. Although not instant-eating, they are not bad for boiling soup or making vegetable rice when camping."
