# Chapter 1079 - Cavalry Conflict

Along the way, Zhu Mingxia kept a gloomy face, making Huang Xiong mutter in his heart, unclear what the Chief was thinking. He used to be an old soldier of Dengzhou and was habitually trying to figure out the superior's intentions. As long as the superior had a long face, he would panic. It wasn't good to ask, so he could only honestly follow by the side.

"Huang Xiong, do you think the number of people I brought out is a bit too few?"

Hearing Zhu Mingxia ask, Huang Xiong perked up and immediately replied: "Report to Detachment Leader, this recovery team consists of two infantry companies, one baggage company, one village brave company, one cavalry squad, and a work team, totaling four hundred and seventy people. It is not few."

"It's enough to recover refugees." Zhu Mingxia glanced coldly at Huang Xiong and continued: "But if we want to do something other than recovering refugees, this bit is not enough to look at."

"What plans do you have, Detachment Leader?"

"Hmph—I just wanted to roast (*tucao*) it."

Huang Xiong naturally didn't understand what "roast" (*tucao*) meant, but he also knew that there was meaning in Zhu Mingxia's words. When a superior wanted to open up, a subordinate had better listen patiently. Any interruption was asking for trouble, so he kept his head down and followed closely, listening carefully to what Zhu Mingxia said, afraid of missing even a little bit.

"Huang Xiong, our army is brave and good at fighting, capable of fighting one against ten. You guys were personally trained by me; you are all soldiers made of iron." Zhu Mingxia pointed towards Dengzhou, "Far from what that bunch of trash in Dengzhou can contend with. My Northbound Detachment has two thousand people; don't look at the small number, if we want to break Dengzhou City, we can do it just the same. The result? We can only turtle up in Qimu Island because we have to avoid direct military conflict."

Huang Xiong was once a Dengzhou soldier. After the news of the rebels massacring local soldiers and civilians upon breaking the city came, he felt quite miserable in his heart. It was just that the Chiefs kept holding the troops back, and he, a small officer, couldn't say anything. Hearing Zhu Mingxia say this, he couldn't help but sigh.

"We can't even attack Huang County. That is the rebels' barrier, used to defend against us. Once we attack Huang County, that would be starting a proper war. Kong Youde and Li Jiucheng would have to mobilize a large army to fight us to the death. Beating them is of course nothing—easy as turning over a hand. But my current mission is after all not to fight the rebels; otherwise, taking Huang County would be much simpler than hanging around here collecting refugees."

The Senate's intervention in the Jiaodong Peninsula had a significant impact on history. Although the refugee camp on Qimu Island did not look like a military camp to the outside world, there were thousands upon thousands of people gathering there. To put it nicely, they were refugees; to put it bluntly, they were a potential large group of bandits. In the eyes of people at that time, with so many people gathered together, even if they weren't bandits, they wouldn't be good birds—if one day they didn't have enough to eat and rushed out, that would be human locusts.

Shortly after occupying Dengzhou, the rebels immediately attacked Huang County, preparing to use Huang County as a stronghold to consolidate their rear. The offensive towards Laizhou was to broaden the scope of activity. Capturing Huang County was to ensure a reliable support point on the periphery of Dengzhou—once the court wanted to suppress, the first batch of government troops would definitely attack from the direction of Huang County.

Because a large number of refugees had gathered on Qimu Island, the rebels attacking Huang County this time were not only more numerous than recorded in history, but after capturing Huang County, they were more actively capturing able-bodied men to enrich their strength. If he didn't come out to actively pick up these refugees, he feared none of them could run away and would all be caught. Zhu Mingxia jokingly called this collection "Operation Plunder Little Brothers." What he wanted to do was to plunder population from under the opponent's nose with as little combat or no combat as possible. "Wouldn't it be fine to directly f**k over the rebels!" He howled like this in his heart more than once.

Amidst Zhu Mingxia's roasting, the recovery team arrived at an abandoned village. The buildings in this village were relatively intact, with dilapidated fences and barely recognizable earthen walls. If water could be replenished locally, it would be suitable to set up camp here. Zhu Mingxia immediately ordered a search team to enter the village to search.

"There is no one in the village! There is a well—" The scout hesitated, "Someone threw a corpse in the well; it can't be used."

Wang Qisuo, the scout sent to search the village, reported. He came from a local salt smuggler background, could speak the dialects of Dengzhou and surrounding areas, and was quite clever. His training results were very good, so Zhu Mingxia selected him to be a scout in the Advance Column, specifically assisting the regular army scouts in local activities.

"It seems the rebels have been here." Zhu Mingxia said. Throwing corpses into wells was equivalent to destroying the necessary conditions for local survival, forcing the local people to scatter—even if someone was lucky enough not to be caught by the rebels, they couldn't stay in the village.

Zhu Mingxia had no doubt that if it hadn't been snowing recently making it difficult to start fires, the rebels would probably have completely burned down the village.

However, this was a suitable relay campsite. If there was no clean water source, collecting snow from the ground would barely do—only for fuel, they would have to tear down houses. Zhu Mingxia thought, *anyway, the people in this village won't be coming back.*

He ordered some personnel to stay behind for defense, including some refugees collected along the way, settled into empty houses to make fires for warmth and let them rest temporarily. Others piled up village sundries and some baggage to form a shanzhai version of a street barricade to block the east and west ends, and buried landmines on the north and south sides of the village to guard against sneak attacks.

He himself led the main force to continue forward. All the cavalry in his hand were sent out to actively contact the largest refugee group and directly annihilate small groups of enemies encountered. Zhu Mingxia estimated: The rebels would very likely dispatch a few cavalry to harass the refugees, slow down their marching speed, and facilitate capture by follow-up troops. Of course, it was also possible that just some stragglers ran out to rob.

On the frozen Shandong earth, more than a hundred refugees huddled together. Several lay motionless on the ground, blood gurgling from their wounds. More than a dozen executioners were sitting on horses, happily sizing up their spoils. They were rebels under Kong Youde. There were dozens of other cavalry groups like them. The purpose of coming out in large numbers was only one: robbing refugees. Young and beautiful women were abducted, belongings were snatched, and others didn't matter whether they lived or died. This kind of plundering sometimes yielded good treasures without much risk. Many rebels were happy to do so.

A bald-browed man at the head was the first to jump off his horse, wanting to carefully size up the women among the refugees. But everyone lowered their heads and huddled up. Barely grabbing their hair to force them to look up, it was still smoky and black, making it hard to see clearly. He instantly flew into a rage, raised his sword, and hacked two more refugees to death. He grinned with a big mouth and roared: "Grandma's bear (*Nainai ge Xiong*), women hurry over to Granddaddy here. If you dawdle anymore, I'll kill one with each cut and chop you all."

Saying this, he raised his sword, wanting to hack the third person. Before this sword could cut down, someone shouted: "Cavalry!"

Bald-brow followed the voice and looked. More than a hundred *zhang* away, a small squad of cavalry was slowly running towards them. Bald-brow dropped the refugee and hurriedly raised his sword to mount—the vision on the horse was better.

Bald-brow used to be a cavalryman in the Liaodong Garrison and had fought with the Manchus in Liaodong—although they lost every battle, relying on his horsemanship and the ability to grasp the best time to flee, he could always stay safe and sound.

Relying on this ability to escape, he accumulated merit to become a Commander (*Dusi*)—however, Mao Wenlong granted official titles too numerously and indiscriminately on Pi Island back then, so after his death, the official ranks of Dongjiang generals were several grades lower. Bald-brow was just a Squad Leader (*Bazong*).

Years of experience in fleeing made him quite cautious about enemies, especially mounted enemies, because the biggest threat to fleeing cavalry was pursuing cavalry.

 exerting force on the stirrups with both feet, standing upright, looking over, he saw that these cavalrymen wore no armor, and their attire had never been seen before: wearing gray cloaks on the outside, tall hats on their heads, coming towards him in a double column.

The comers were hostile. The numbers on both sides were about the same. Bald-brow and these rebels under him had seen battle arrays after all. Seeing that the other side had no numerical advantage and no one wore armor, they didn't scatter but gathered together, intending to have a cavalry charge.

Although Liaodong cavalry performed averagely when facing the Manchus, they could fight one battle with them after all. Inside the pass, they were known as "Iron Cavalry," so neither Bald-brow nor his subordinate cavalry took the dozen or so cavalrymen in front of them seriously—even though the troop strength of both sides was equal.

However, the other side did not directly draw swords and charge over. Instead, they reined in their horses seventy or eighty *zhang* away. Except for three or four riders, everyone else dismounted. Lined up in a row.

Bald-brow pulled down the iron helmet on his head, a bit confused. *Did the other side dismount to prepare for archery?* Back then in Liaodong, he had seen Tartars do this, but this distance was really a bit far—even Tartars known for strong bows and hard arrows wouldn't dismount to shoot arrows so far away. He waved his hand: "Everyone charge! Slash for a while!"

More than a dozen cavalrymen drew their swords simultaneously and spurred their horses to charge fiercely.

Because there were very few people on both sides, Bald-brow didn't order his men to adopt any formation, simply pouncing on them directly.

Almost at the same time they spurred their horses to gallop, a burst of crisp cracking sounds came to their ears.

"Too early!" Bald-brow roared. Firing guns so far away was basically just listening to a loud noise! He lowered his head, clamped the horse's belly with his legs, and continued to gallop wildly.

However, a second volley of gunshots rang out very quickly. A rebel cavalryman's horse suddenly fell, followed by another one falling.

The gunshots became increasingly dense. The opponent's bird guns seemed capable of continuous fire! Before running twenty *zhang*, three or four people had already fallen. When another person fell, everyone turned their horses' heads around in unison without waiting for orders, whipped the horses' rumps wildly a few times, and directly chose to run away without saying a word.

The rescued refugees looked at these cavalrymen in horror. They didn't know what this new group of people wanted to do. Fortunately, the languages were mutually intelligible. After some communication, they learned that the other party came from Qimu Island specifically to pick them up to take refuge on Qimu Island. Qimu Island was originally not the destination for these refugees, but in front of these cavalrymen who had just killed people, they had no other choice.
