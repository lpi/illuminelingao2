# Chapter 391 - The Five-Masted Ship

Previously he'd always sailed on the locally-built 70-ton lateen fishing boats most common here. The transmigrators possessed many such vessels, mainly used as transports, occasionally moonlighting as patrol boats—chasing down fishing boats refusing to pay fishing tax, suppressing small pirate bands preying on fishermen, protecting passing merchant ships, and so forth.

Recently Naval Command had launched "Maritime Security Rectification Month." From dawn to dusk, Naval Command vessels patrolled constantly along the several-dozen-kilometer coastline between Bo-pu and Ma-miu. This greatly increased patrol boat sorties; vessels originally used for transport had been transferred to patrol duty. To ensure numerical superiority, ships operated in groups—three to five vessels per formation. Each formation had at least one or two ships equipped with cannons—many cannons borrowed from the Army.

These ships looked rather shabby: on deck sat temporarily borrowed Army 12-pound M1857 cannons—simply tied to the foredeck with rope. Around the cannons, straw bags filled with wet sand formed gun emplacements. Among the marines were gray-uniformed Army gunners on loan—the Navy lacked sufficient gunners.

"If only all patrol boats were like 101." On his first voyage aboard Patrol Boat 101, Yue Lin couldn't stop praising its sailing performance—nimble, convenient, highly efficient sail utilization. No wonder Director Wen said lateen sails were best suited for coastal navigation.

Just then, the lookout suddenly shouted:

"Something at three o'clock!"

Yue Lin quickly raised the binoculars hanging from his chest. Two or three nautical miles away, over a dozen small vessels were surrounding a large ship. The large ship was the type of big Guangdong-style vessel common along China's coast—impressive tonnage, at least four or five hundred tons. Yue Lin was quite surprised—the Qiongzhou Strait wasn't on ocean vessel routes. Such large oceangoing traders rarely appeared here. Even if such ships came to Hainan, they'd resupply at Qiongshan County's Shenying Harbor; some went directly to Yulin before stopping. They wouldn't venture into Lingao-Chengmai waters.

"How can there be such a big ship?" Yue Lin could hardly believe his eyes, quickly adjusting magnification to maximum eight-power:

The large ship's hull listed to one side, grounded on a sandbar. Sails still hung, already very tattered. Through binoculars he could see many people climbing onto the large ship. The deck was crowded with heads; smoke and flames occasionally rose.

Pirates robbing! Yue Lin grew excited—the tedious patrol and capture work finally had some fresh flavor! A great opportunity for action!

"Battle stations!" he shouted.

The drummer on standby at the stern castle immediately beat rapid drums. Deck sailors and soldiers quickly busied themselves. Petty officers blew whistles; off-duty sailors and marines poured up from below deck.

"Left rudder, 15 degrees! Full speed ahead!" Yue Lin gripped the railing and shouted imposingly.

"Fifteen degrees, left!" the helmsman acknowledged, turning the wheel. Naval Command had converted all its better-condition vessels over 50 tons to wheel-helm operation.

Immediately the stern castle signal officer transmitted orders to flanking ships. Following vessels 108 and 111 also began turning.

"Lower oars one, three, and five!" Ruan Xiaowu shouted. Yue Lin's orders sounded impressive, but without engines, "full speed ahead" meant lowering the ship's three pairs of oars for manual rowing to increase speed.

Ruan Xiaowu was now a proper naval cadet. After returning from the circumnavigation voyage, all participating naval cadets had received promotions. Though only fifteen, he already wore the silver sleeve braid marking cadet rank. With this insignia, he was clearly distinguished from deck sailors. Sailors saluted when seeing him. However, he still didn't pay officer mess fees—eating supply-system rations like enlisted men.

His naval uniform now bore an additional sleeve strip—"First Circumnavigation Commemorative Strip"—awarded to all voyage participants. Ruan Xiaowu now found his originally awkward front-buttoned jacket increasingly impressive. He frequently walked East Gate Market on leave, dressed immaculately, observing the bustling crowds and finding them quite rustic—he'd forgotten what he'd looked like arriving in Lingao.

Today he was Patrol Boat 101's duty officer, responsible for second morning watch—4 AM to 8 AM. The moment battle stations sounded, Ruan Xiaowu's throat tightened—battle! Against pirates!

As a fisherman's son, Ruan Xiaowu knew pirates well. Small pirate bands unable to rob large ships targeted defenseless lone fishing boats—stealing catches was common. Most terrifying was pirates forcing fishermen to join them, sometimes simply abducting people and boats together. Especially when pirates prepared to fight each other or face Imperial suppression, such conscription-style forced recruitment peaked. Several of Ruan Xiaowu's relatives had suffered such disasters—losing lives or boats. Eventually his father was captured and made a pirate, dying when his ship was destroyed during an Imperial suppression operation, leaving the family homeless. Thus he particularly hated pirates; his file rated his "stance extremely firm"—developed by the Political Security Bureau as a Navy "Circle of Ten" member.

Under rowing sailors' propulsion, the patrol flotilla accelerated to 5 knots.

Yue Lin ordered: "Fire warning shot!"

The deck cannon immediately spewed white smoke; deafening thunder echoed across the water. But the pirate ships surrounding the large vessel seemed unmoved. Through binoculars Yue Lin saw people frantically transferring things from the large ship to small boats; others on small boat decks handled long tubular objects resembling firearms.

Since the transmigrator collective dominated locally, small pirate bands generally avoided direct confrontation. Yue Lin had often encountered enemies fleeing without fighting. If they raised sails at 3-4 nautical miles, his flotilla couldn't catch them. But these enemies apparently didn't intend to flee.

Yue Lin estimated one and a half nautical miles remaining—12-pound cannons could reach, but accuracy was hopeless. Firing or not made little difference.

Perhaps cargo remained unlooted, or perhaps seeing only three approaching ships, some vessels surrounding the large ship suddenly turned, aggressively charging toward the flotilla.

"Enemy showing attack intent!" Ruan Xiaowu shouted. "Prepare to engage!"

"Bold—either that or the loot's worth it." Through binoculars Yue Lin saw several ships continuing to unload. Apparently enemies intended protecting their prize at all costs.

"Looks like a fight." Adrenaline surging, Yue Lin shouted: "Armor up!"

His orderly quickly fetched his stab-resistant vest, knee guards, steel helmet, and cut-resistant chain gloves from the stern cabin, helping him dress. Yue Lin received the last item—a replica American naval officer's sword—drew it and flourished it spiritedly:

"All ships, prepare for battle!"

Red triangular battle flags rose; combat personnel took positions. Soldiers loaded rifles; sailors brought iron cans of ready-use powder up from below—no powder was kept near guns during combat. At gun positions, cannons were loaded with powder and fitted with friction primers; shells stood ready beside assistant gunners. Shooters loaded heavy drums onto "typewriters," locking and chambering. Marines' rifles lacked bayonets—impractical on ships—replaced by Navy Model 1629 machetes: copies of the famous Rwandan panga, issued in small batches to naval vessels.

"Single file, seize the weather gauge!" As a naval enthusiast, Yue Lin firmly followed Royal Navy tradition: seize the wind, attack proactively.

"Steady! No firing without orders." Yue Lin's hands and feet went cold; he nearly gave orders in Cantonese again.

The enemy ships now crackled like firecrackers with ragged popping; white smoke rose from throughout their formation. This habit of firing before reaching effective range—Yue Lin had witnessed many times, even in transmigrator-trained soldiers initially. Apparently firearms were just for courage. Army and Navy had invested enormous effort to correct this habit.

"Range five cables!" spotters continuously reported enemy positions.

"Signal 108 and 111: follow flagship closely."

Once battle began, Yue Lin's so-called command became meaningless. Like all naval commanders before radio, once engaged, each ship acted on its captain's judgment. In the Naval Department, melee tactics had no support; formation tactics dominated.

At three cables' range, Patrol Boat 101 fired a solid shot. The cannonball flew over the undulating boats, splashing into the sea. A naval gunner with rangefinder immediately measured the impact distance. The gunner adjusted elevation.

Then the other two ships also fired. One sampan was hit; wooden splinters flew several meters high.

"Good shooting! Maintain fire!"

The flotilla cut across the pirate formation, executing crossing-the-T tactics. Besides the three patrol boats' 12-pounders, 1-pound falconets for personnel casualties and marines' rifles blazed at these various-sized vessels. The sea was shrouded in gun smoke; muzzle flashes occasionally visible.

Patrol boat cannons had all switched to canister. Per naval combat experience, at 50-100 meters against small-scale coastal pirates, canister was more lethal. These impoverished pirates' boats were almost entirely ordinary timber, limited thickness, unable to withstand canister fire. Their habit of crowding on deck to board gave opportunities to sweep decks with canister.

"Hard starboard, adjust to eleven o'clock heading for another pass!" Deck smoke had cleared; Yue Lin carefully avoided closing too near enemy ships, coming about to cross the T again.

Patrol Boat 101's maneuverability was on full display during this turn. Within minutes, the lateen sail came about to windward position, driving the boat through a sharp turn. The hull heeled dramatically; spray splashed Yue Lin's face.

By comparison, the two lateen fishing boats turned much more sluggishly. Only after ten-plus minutes did all three ships complete turning and reforming.

Smoke had cleared. In that chaotic exchange, the three ships suffered virtually no substantial damage—only sail holes large and small proved pirates' return fire had been quite swift. But pirate losses were clearly greater: several long sampans were sinking; other larger vessels were strewn with corpses, casualties heavy.

Surviving pirates jumped overboard, hoping to swim to other vessels in their formation. But those ships' crews now knew the enemy's ferocity—concerned only with escape, they had no thought of rescuing comrades! Not a single rope was thrown. Pirates fired wildly while turning to flee. Pirates still transferring cargo on the large ship couldn't reach boats before comrades cut lines and fled. The abandoned screamed from the deck; some jumped desperately, trying to swim to safety, instead smashing to death on the sandbar. Chaos erupted around the large ship.

The patrol flotilla's second salvo began. This time, Patrol Boat 101's chain shot struck a single-masted boat's mast, instantly disabling it. It drifted before them, crowded with people—a perfect target.

"'Typewriter,' open fire!" Yue Lin had long wanted to test this new weapon's power.

Two specially-trained sailors braced shoulder stocks and pulled firing levers.

The typewriter's violent recoil nearly knocked Yue Lin down. Immediately the bridge was engulfed in thick smoke. Gunfire deafened.

The typewriter's recoil was enormous; muzzle swing was severe. It roared terribly, long muzzle flames spewing through smoke. Bullets swept the deck; heads, limbs, and body parts were shredded by 14mm lead balls, flung in all directions. Even the smoke turned pinkish—a massacre.

No need for cannons or anything else. After the typewriter emptied three drums into it, the boat drifted lifelessly—no living souls visible.

Gunners loaded a fourth drum. By now the entire "typewriter" was scalding hot, barrel smoking. Gunners had to don thick gloves to continue operating.

"Engage the sampans at four o'clock." Yue Lin ordered. Four or five sampans were rowing frantically toward shore. He wanted to observe the "typewriter's" accuracy issues—judging by that violent shaking, precision was probably concerning.

Indeed, the typewriter's bullets did "spray"—initial rounds missed the boats by wide margins. But once adjusted, its power satisfied: the boats were shot full of water and sank under fire. After several minutes, the multi-barrel gun's wooden grips became too hot to hold; firing ceased.

"Fierce stuff." Yue Lin wiped sweat from his forehead. The two "gunners" were blackened by powder smoke; the entire barrel and receiver were steaming, smelling of burning.

"Seems we didn't fire many rounds." Yue Lin checked—the "typewriter" had only expended ten drums. Minié rifle barrels could fire fifteen or sixteen rounds continuously in combat without overheating this severely.

This battle, like previous naval encounters, became a rout. When the situation turned unfavorable, pirates scattered. Yue Lin didn't dare split his force to pursue, only leading the flotilla after the largest two-masted ship. Eventually cannon fire forced its surrender, capturing sixty or seventy prisoners. But roughly half the ships escaped.

Even so, the waters around the sandbar had become a charnel house. The surface was covered with debris, wrecked boats, and floating corpses. Yue Lin's formation also fished up several dozen pirates still able to call for help and breathe.

But what interested him most was this large Guangdong-style ship grounded on the sandbar. What was the origin of this vessel suddenly appearing in the Qiongzhou Strait?

For caution, he personally led one ship to guard here, dispatching 111 to Bo-pu to report, requesting engineering personnel to assess whether this ship could be refloated—if possible, this prize would be enormous.

Yue Lin sent men ashore on the sandbar to check for hidden enemies. The sandbar was strewn with various crates and baskets, some burst open revealing cargo—mostly porcelain, silk, and other valuables, plus baskets of medicinal herbs. This was apparently a typical South Seas trading vessel.

"Ruan Xiaowu, immediately organize twenty marines and sailors," Yue Lin ordered. "Prepare equipment for boarding!"

"Yes sir!" Ruan Xiaowu saluted and hurried to prepare grappling hooks and ropes.

Meanwhile Yue Lin directed battlefield cleanup: gathering and loading cargo, inspecting floating vessels one by one—those with value received minor repairs and were towed back; worthless ones were scuttled.

Ruan Xiaowu, machete on back, Derringer pistol at hip, spat in his palms, leaped to grab a thick rope hanging from the gunwale, and climbed aboard first—"leading from the front" was a basic principle of transmigrator collective officer education. His men followed one by one.

On the broad deck of the large Guangdong ship, signs of fierce combat were everywhere—blood and corpses, plus cargo dropped during transfer.
