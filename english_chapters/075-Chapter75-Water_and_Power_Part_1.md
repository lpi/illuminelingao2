# Chapter 75: Water and Power (Part 1)

This generator-driving locomobile was originally intended for the main city district, but its severe pollution—flying ash, loud noise—plus the boiler's heavy water demand led to final installation in the hydroelectric zone. To protect against floods, the thermal power station, distribution room, and substation foundations were deliberately raised.

Though the locomobile had many advantages for the transmigrators, its daily fuel consumption was considerable—not to mention that boilers needed soft water. Shipping distilled water from the ships was too extravagant. Natural water was best if rainwater; river water could work but ideally needed softening. Luo Duo said he could make tannin extract for water softening, but there was no quick source for materials. Finally, Wang Luobin, drawing on rural experience, said boiled water could substitute.

Boiling water for this behemoth seemed a bit absurd. A row of stoves was dug along the riverbank, every pot from the ships unloaded for boiling water—flames roaring, steam billowing, quite spectacular. The transmigrators threw themselves into grass-cutting and logging; fuel piles grew mountain-high.

"Why not use diesel generators?" Wen Desi, viewing this spectacle, felt no excitement. To him, it was purely wasted time and labor. The locomobile avoided oil consumption, true, but this labor expenditure wasn't economical either.

High-powered locomobiles required hardened ground—not just the locomobile's foundation, but the entire city district needed ground hardening, especially the planned simple-housing residential area and city streets.

The transmigrators didn't have bricks yet, but making concrete was easy. Cement and rebar had been shipped over. At Bairren Rapids, stone was unlimited—historically, this had always been Lingao's quarry, supplying not just the county but neighboring ones too. After the transmigrators arrived, the masons fled, but they'd left behind much dressed stone. The quarry also had plenty of leftover crushed stone—the riverbed had sand aplenty, usable after sifting. Cement and mixers came from Bopu. Concrete also needed wooden forms. Wu Kuangming had set up an electric sawmill at Bopu, conveniently producing lumber of various sizes; molds were quickly manufactured and delivered.

After hardening the locomobile power station's foundation, the Building Group pushed ahead to start the hydroelectric project—after all, boiling water daily for the boiler wasn't sustainable. Moreover, as Committee offices, residential areas, and new industrial zones relocated and were established, power demand would soar. Current output wouldn't suffice.

The Energy Group's energy plan designated Bairren Rapids hydroelectric station as the priority project. Complete design drawings were in hand, but after consulting with the Building Group, everyone agreed full implementation was currently beyond their capabilities.

The historical Bairren Rapids hydroelectric station—started after Spring Festival 1967 and completed by late 1968—had a 94-meter-long dam, 7.5 meters high, plus matching gates, culverts, channels, aqueducts, pipes... Even in 20th-century Lingao, this was a countywide effort. From mobilizing 300+ cadres, 100+ hydroelectric engineers, to conscripting hundreds of workers countywide—even specially summoning 200+ fishing-village women from Touzui, Huanglong, and Kunshe communes to carry heavy stones. Total labor: 64,000 work-days. Earthwork: 51,800 cubic meters. Masonry: 5,110 cubic meters. Concrete: 630 cubic meters...

These figures were astronomical for the transmigrators. Complete drawings could only be shelved. The final decision: a simple channel-diversion power station with a 200KW generator.

The design first excavated an intake channel upstream of Bairren Rapids' nine-level cascade. Channel width and depth were calculated from flow and gradient—fortunately, standard tables existed. Final specifications: bottom width 1.5 meters, water depth 1 meter.

The intake channel fed into a pressure forebay—a pool connecting the channel to the penstock. It comprised an anterior chamber, trash rack, gate, inlet chamber, spillway, and sediment outlet.

The pressure forebay was a crucial component. It settled sediment and blocked floating debris from entering and damaging turbines. With multiple units, it also distributed water flow. Its main function was regulating water volume entering turbines.

When station load increased and turbine flow demand rose, the forebay reservoir could supplement channel shortfalls, preventing water-level drops that would suck air into the penstock and reduce output. Conversely, when load suddenly dropped or upstream flooding occurred, excess channel flow could be discharged through the spillway, protecting structures.

The channel gate controlled flow and cutoff, located in the forebay's inlet chamber. Being a small station, the gate was made of wood. Wang Luobin, from rural observations, recommended a wooden curved gate popular during a certain period—operated with pulley systems and hand-cranked windlasses for opening, closing by gravity. Simple structure, quick operation, very convenient.

The penstock was a major challenge. As the component creating pressure head to drive turbines, it had to withstand not only head pressure but also water-hammer pressure from sudden flow stoppage when closing turbine guide vanes or gates. Penstocks needed high strength, or they'd crack.

Modern small-to-medium stations typically used steel or reinforced-concrete pipe. Large-diameter steel pipe wasn't available. Reinforced-concrete pipe was manufacturable but consumed too much rebar and cement—with no capacity yet for self-production, and too many other uses demanding these materials. Someone proposed ceramic pipe, but its tensile strength was poor—would crack under 10-meter head—only suitable for low-head stations. Such large ceramic pieces had never been made; Lingao probably lacked potters capable of firing them. Besides, the transmigrators hadn't even found a pottery kiln—or brick kiln.

Wang Luobin, after much thought, proposed wooden pipe. Made from 4–6cm thick planks joined together and secured with iron hoops, it was stronger than concrete pipe, usable under 100-meter heads—versus concrete pipe's 50-meter limit. With proper care, wooden pipe could last 10–20 years.

Lumber was relatively easy. Logging hadn't stopped a single day. Though lacking drying equipment, Wu Kuangming built a makeshift kiln, slow-smoking wood with brush and leaves. Efficiency was low; drying was uneven—but it provided enough usable lumber.

The problem: joining planks into pipe was like barrel-making—a nearly lost craft, let alone making such large-diameter pipes. After several failures, someone finally used CAD modeling to decompose every plank's standard dimensions. The lumber team looked at drawings with millimeter-precise dimensions and detailed angles, laughing bitterly—*We don't have CNC saws*.

But with numbers, experimentation had direction. Following the drawings, after more days of trial, they finally assembled the first pipe: 4 meters long, 0.7-meter diameter, secured with iron hoops. Simple water testing showed joint strength was insufficient. For the second pipe, they added hoops and thicker planks. After passing tests, the sawmill produced 32 meters of wooden penstock—12 meters as backup. This proved necessary; 2 pipes were damaged during construction. Pipe joints were sealed with cement mortar. Penstock support piers and anchor blocks were stone masonry with cement mortar.

At the penstock's base was the powerhouse. Its foundation had high requirements, so they spared no expense using crushed-stone mortar concrete, partly utilizing variously sized stone bars of unknown purpose from the quarry.

Though Mei Wan and his Building Engineering Group had never built a hydroelectric station, the rural-designed power-station equipment came with detailed, easy-to-understand manuals. A group with rich engineering experience studied carefully, combined with memories of stations they'd seen, and figuring out construction methods wasn't hard. Excavating earthwork and channels, building the powerhouse, even erecting power poles—all well within their capabilities. The channel was earthen; other structures used cement-mortar stone masonry.

Some rocky sections were difficult to excavate, but with air compressors and pneumatic hammers, these were overcome. The Committee had allocated ammonium nitrate and diesel for blasting if needed, but Mei Wan thought it best to minimize using such heavy weapons—none of them had blasting experience.

Wang Luobin, having lived and worked in rural Guangxi for years, knew agricultural infrastructure like small hydropower well. He'd been coordinating recent projects. Touring the site, he saw a group gathered at the hydroelectric station, apparently arguing. Moving closer, he recognized Building Group members and crew—Group Leader Mei Wan on one side; on the other, vaguely familiar, was Zhuo Tianmin, who'd proposed the simple-road approach during highway construction.
