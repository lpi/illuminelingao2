# Chapter 2128 - A Mess

"Oh." Zhu Quanxing glanced at his watch—it was nearly noon. These worthies had been waiting three or four hours. Though he had no fondness for them, he still needed to make use of them. After all, the local notables knew the situation best and controlled the most social resources. In particular, the Rice Merchants' Guild—he had high hopes for them.

"Show them in."

Leading the "delegation of worthies" was none other than Luo Yangming. By his cover rules, he couldn't reveal his identity; he had to wait for his "superiors" to initiate contact.

At this moment, he bore a "grave responsibility." His document wallet held not only the gift list but also the "agency authorization certificate" that Dachang Rice Company had issued him—really just a commercial partnership credential. But the "worthies" believed this was an official "license" from the Australians, a way to make connections.

The worthies of Wuzhou knew little about the Council of Elders, though they had heard assorted rumors. The Fubo Army's conduct upon entering the city had confirmed what they'd heard, so their mood was no longer as anxious as it had been that morning. Though the biggest magnates hadn't dared come in person, all the major households—including gentry who had fled to the countryside—had sent representatives, at least a close relative.

Luo Yangming knew what the worthies most urgently wanted to learn: first, whether the Council of Elders intended to stay in Wuzhou; second, if so, what price they would have to pay.

The first point seemed beyond doubt. The Australians had come in force; they couldn't just fight and leave. Anyone with a sense of geography understood Wuzhou's importance. So they were more concerned about the second point.

Since ancient times, whenever guest troops arrived, local magnates had to pay tribute—an iron rule. A few years ago, when Governor-General Wang's punitive expedition against the Hair-Bandits had ended in defeat, all Guangdong had panicked. Quite a few Guangxi troops had been summoned as reinforcements, and Wuzhou had been thrown into chaos. As for the recent guest troops invited by Governor-General Xiong—they had been ready to wipe Wuzhou out entirely.

Now the Australians had come. No matter how good their discipline, the wealthy still needed to show proper deference. The magnates didn't know how large the Australians' appetite might be, or how they distinguished "public" from "private." Though a gift list and an army reward checklist had been drawn up, no one knew whether the Australians would be satisfied. They were nervous, fearing the Australian general might turn hostile and have them strung up—they had heard plenty of such stories.

Zhu Quanxing received Luo Yangming and his delegation, offered the customary reassurances about their safety and property, and directed the naturalized vice director of the Wuzhou Military Government to negotiate with them. He announced the establishment of a "Relief Bureau" and asked the worthies to "contribute money and effort"—all this was expected, and everyone agreed.

"I won't waste words," Zhu Quanxing said. His chief concern was the grain problem. "Wuzhou has suffered warfare; there's much damage in the city. Many civilians are homeless and need shelter repairs as soon as possible. Refugees affected by the fighting need relief as well—please lend your full support. In addition, our army requires provisions. The summer and autumn taxes haven't come due yet, and most common folk have barely enough for themselves. The 'reasonable burden' will have to fall on you gentlemen."

Money and grain—this was expected and surprised no one. Someone immediately began pleading hardship.

"Silver we can scrape together; it's not too hard. But grain... that's truly difficult..."

The speaker was one Da Xinxuan, who owned a rice shop in Wuzhou. But behind this shop stood the Wu family, one of the city's prominent gentry clans. Da Xinxuan came with a certain confidence—because the young master of the Wu family had dealt with the Australians years ago and was reportedly friends with Boss Guo of Guangzhou, having done several "big deals" together.

Supposedly, the Australians were fond of old connections; those who had done them service wouldn't suffer. So he was the first to cry poverty.

Da Xinxuan lamented that the city had once held substantial grain stores—conservatively, the various rice merchants' warehouses held thirty or forty thousand *shi*. But ever since Governor-General Xiong arrived in Wuzhou, what with feeding men and horses and the frantic shipments to Guangxi, more than half the reserves were gone. The past few days of fighting had meant burning and looting, and every rice merchant had suffered heavily. His own shop was down to only four or five hundred *shi*.

"...I'm actually one of the better off. Some smaller merchants have had their warehouses stripped bare."

Luo Yangming knew this account, though partly "pleading poverty," wasn't entirely false. The rice merchants had suffered terribly—his own shop hadn't been left a single grain by the soldiers.

So he cleared his throat and added: "Chief, the local rice trade has indeed suffered devastating losses. We will certainly do our best to contribute our 'reasonable burden,' but we beg your indulgence on the timing and amounts."

Zhu Quanxing nodded. "Discuss the details with the vice director. For now, provide a hundred *shi* of rice immediately to set up porridge stations for the refugees."

"Yes, yes—the porridge stations were already in operation; we'll have them running again at once."

Grain inside the city really was scarce. Not only had the merchants' warehouses been depleted; the prefectural and county granaries and the civilian Ever-Normal Granaries were nearly empty too. The logistics officers' preliminary count put seized grain at less than four thousand *shi*, some of it damaged by fire, smoke, or water.

"It seems Old Xiong really did leave us a mess," Zhu Mingxia sighed upon receiving the first post-takeover report.

Right now, they had to both gather grain and provide relief. Just the civilians rendered homeless by the urban unrest numbered several hundred households—several thousand people. During the expulsion of civilians, many shops and homes had been ransacked by soldiers and criminals; these victims also urgently needed aid. A rough count showed over twenty thousand people in need of relief.

Xu Ke had already gone into the city to "investigate." First, he was supervising prisoner interrogations to see if there was any valuable intelligence. Second, he had to make contact with "Lone Wolf." Apart from needing detailed intelligence on Wuzhou, he was quite curious about this operative who had passed along critical information and swayed a significant portion of the city's powerbrokers.

Chang Qingyun and fifty-odd others were being held in the barbican. Their ropes hadn't been removed, and no one gave him special treatment just because he looked like a gentleman. The gate stood wide open, bustling with traffic; the soldiers coming and going, whether running about or standing guard, were all neatly dressed and smartly turned out.

"Two years apart, and the Hair-Bandits have grown this strong!" Chang Qingyun sighed.

The prisoners were untied one by one, each taken to a small room at the base of the wall for questioning. Most came out and were held separately; a few emerged beaming and were allowed into the city.

Sitting at the foot of the wall, Chang Qingyun was deeply unhappy. Everyone knew that falling into Hair-Bandit hands at least meant no fear for one's life, but a stream of various Australians kept pointing at them, and the Guangxi soldiers tied up alongside him kept shooting him hostile glances—it all made him uneasy.

Changqing had gone into the little room quite a while ago and hadn't come out. Chang Qingyun was wondering what was happening when suddenly a passerby shouted: "That's Chang Qingyun! He's the one who wanted to burn down the city!"

A yamen clerk from the prefectural office had recognized him. This clerk owned considerable property in Wuzhou and had been in a panic ever since hearing that Governor Xiong meant to burn the city. Once the Fubo Army took over, he had promptly sided with Australia-Song and was now guiding Australians in inventorying the Wuzhou granaries. His shout drew dozens of people, shouting "Kill him!" "Burn him!" "Xiong Wencan's lackey!" Suddenly spit, mud, and charred debris were flying at Chang Qingyun.

"Break it up! Break it up!" Fubo Army soldiers quickly dispersed the crowd; two grabbed Chang Qingyun by the arms and hauled him into the little room.

Chang Qingyun had taken a brick fragment to the forehead and was still dazed when he was pushed down onto a bamboo chair.

He steadied himself and looked up. Behind the desk sat three men. Two were young and clearly naturalized locals in uniforms—not real Australians. The third sat slightly back, face hidden in shadow.

"Name?" asked one of the young men.

"Your humble servant is Chang Qingyun."

"You were Xiong Wencan's staff officer?"

"Yes, I served in Governor Xiong's staff."

"Was the plan to burn Wuzhou your idea?"

"No. This is slander by treacherous people. I beg your honor to investigate." Chang Qingyun knew he absolutely could not admit to this; otherwise, to win popular support, the Australians would certainly punish him severely—possibly hang him outright. "The idea came from Chang Pu, the Enping County Magistrate. It had nothing to do with me."

"Whether it was your idea, we will certainly find out. We suggest you confess voluntarily and seek lenient treatment."

"It truly was not my doing. Heaven is my witness!" Chang Qingyun knew the Australians didn't fabricate charges or arbitrarily borrow heads; he felt somewhat reassured.

"Do you know where Xiong Wencan went?"

"I do not know." Chang Qingyun thought this sounded too curt, so he added: "The day before your army entered the city, he disappeared. If he fled, it would be toward Tengxian, Rongxian, or thereabouts."

"Tell us what you know about the Ming garrison."

Chang Qingyun was puzzled—the defending troops had long since collapsed; what was there to say? But since they asked, he'd better answer honestly to avoid angering the Hair-Bandits.

Having been on the staff, he knew the various forces in detail. He recounted everything: the origins, affiliations, numbers, and officers of both local and guest troops.

"The Ming force that defended Bangshan—where did they come from? And who was their commander?"
