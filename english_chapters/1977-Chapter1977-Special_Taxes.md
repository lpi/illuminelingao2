# Chapter 1977 - Special Taxes

It was close to midnight when the Senate meeting ended. The trio was about to get up when Liu Xiang, as the host of the meeting, stopped them.

"I have a few small questions inconveninet to discuss more in the meeting. I want to consult you."

The trio exchanged glances, wondering what medicine he was selling.

What Liu Xiang asked was also about taxation, but about some "guidance-type" tax categories.

Using taxation to guide industrial structure and standardize social behavior is common in economic work. Although many taxes are criticized as "inventing names to increase tax," which is indeed often the case, it is undeniable that economic measures are sometimes more effective than a million propagandas and encouragements.

The most typical guidance tax implemented by the Senate is the "Slave Tax." This tax has been promoted in the Senate-ruled areas for many years and has been truly effective—because slave-holding became a heavy burden, rich households generally de-registered slaves. Although many slaves still stayed in the household under the name of "free employment" to engage in various services after de-registration, it was a big step forward in personal dependence after all. This has always been the capital bragged about by Civil Affairs transmigrators.

As a senior Civil Affairs transmigrator, Liu Xiang naturally kept this in mind, so he specifically raised this matter again this time. He wanted to levy some special forms of tax: Foot-binding Tax, Concubine Tax, and Clan Tax.

"...Our slave tax collection is very successful and has gradually unfolded in Guangzhou. Can these three taxes also be piloted and promoted?" Liu Xiang said, "My intention isn't for the few tax dollars, but mainly to use this to guide public opinion and transform social atmosphere."

Ai Zhixin thought this Grand Magistrate Liu was indeed worthy of the nickname "King of Tossing," with many tricks. Actually, the taxes he mentioned, including some similar ones, were frequently discussed nonsense topics in the Senate. But people in taxation were not enthusiastic about these taxes: except for a few, most had characteristics of difficult tax base investigation, trivial collection, and low tax amount, belonging to high-cost low-return taxes. So the Finance Department always said "needs long-term research" for similar proposals.

The slave tax worked solely because investigating strictly few rich households capable of holding slaves was easier than investigating foot-binding volume. Moreover, slave-holding itself required contractual documents. The Finance and Tax Department roughly grasped the basic situation of local slaves by using the "contract stamp duty registration" method to re-confirm rights.

Ai Zhixin pondered for a moment and said: "Mayor Liu, regarding the Concubine Tax and Clan Tax you proposed, they can be counted as property tax. We can research how to implement them. But the Foot-binding Tax has no enforceability..."

Liu Xiang was somewhat disappointed—he had originally prepared to use this as his breakthrough point for "changing customs and habits."

The "Anti-Foot-binding" movement in Hainan and other places mainly relied on administrative orders, engaging in "campaign-style" governance. The effect certainly existed, but dramas of power-money trading and crying fathers and mothers were also plentiful. Since then, Liu Xiang had been considering using economic means to carry out "Anti-Foot-binding."

There were many women with bound feet in Guangzhou city. Both the proportion of the female population and the absolute number were more than the Senate's old ruled areas combined. If he could achieve sufficient results on this and become "advanced experience," then "promote" it down, his political achievement in "governing the locality" would be greatly added to.

"Is there any difficulty?" He asked, "Is it because the scope involved is too wide and collection cost high..."

"Not just that; one can say it's simply impossible to collect." Before Ai Zhixin spoke, Zhang Xiaoqi interjected and fired a cannon directly. "This tax is easy to say but has zero operability in practice. First, our tax base is boundless. Probably half the women in Guangzhou city have bound feet. How to verify and register one by one? Second, what about collection? Do we ask them to pay money door-to-door, or set up checkpoints at city gates to look at feet? Third, since it's guidance taxation, naturally some people will unbind feet because of this—after unbinding, feet can't grow back. Does this count as bound or unbound?"

Hearing these three points, Liu Xiang was speechless, looking very awkward.

Wang Qiyi secretly groaned and hurriedly came out to smooth things over: "Mayor Liu, this Foot-binding Tax is indeed extremely difficult. Even if we move the 21st-century Guangzhou Tax Bureau here with people and equipment, this tax can't be collected... Besides, women's small feet in this timeline count as sex... private parts. It seems, seems inappropriate for us to blatantly ask people to show them."

Liu Xiang laughed at himself: "It seems I thought rashly..."

"No, no, you are an administrative leader; what you consider is the general direction. Details are what we consider," Ai Zhixin followed up. "This line of thinking is correct—economic means are more effective than administrative means. Our Finance and Tax Bureau can research and discuss this as a line of thinking."

Thus, the discussion on Clan Tax and Concubine Tax didn't continue. The trio from the Finance and Tax Bureau came out of the Municipal Government and didn't go home separately but went straight to the Bureau to hold a closed-door meeting.

The result of tonight's meeting was better than they expected. Although the wolf-like reaction of transmigrators to tax funds at the beginning was slightly unexpected, surprisingly, there wasn't much questioning on the most critical tax revenue distribution. Everyone accepted the second plan of Tax Sharing very calmly. Not sure if it was because they vigorously disparaged the National/Local Separation plan, or because the transmigrators already detested the old timeline system deeply.

However, Ai Zhixin's speculation seemed more reliable: "We piled theories they didn't understand onto the meeting; they didn't understand and didn't want to show they didn't understand..."

Actually, before the meeting, Wang Qiyi had also proposed a supplementary plan, which was refining tax items and increasing tax categories. He prepared to take it out as a big flatbread when the second plan got stranded. Refining tax items meant formulating applicable tax rates and budget levels separately for tax items under existing tax categories. For example, Property Tax could be subdivided into land, real estate, means of production, etc. Those assets unrelated to the Center and settling locally, like land and real estate, naturally should have high local sharing. Because only when the locality is rich do these things have value and yield more tax; giving high local sharing gives the locality motivation to develop economy. As for increasing tax categories, accurately speaking, it should be increasing tax/fee types. The idea imitated the Urban Construction Maintenance Tax, Education Surcharge, Local Education Surcharge, and Water Conservancy Construction Fund of the old timeline. These taxes and fees serve as surcharges to main taxes (like VAT and Business Tax in the old timeline), collected directly at a fixed ratio of the main tax amount. Collection is convenient and cost extremely low. Moreover, because they are earmarked taxes/fees, all revenue can be assigned to the locality.

Now it seemed this supplementary plan could be temporarily unused, but Ai Zhixin and the others knew this was an inevitable trend. The several "changing customs" taxes proposed by Liu Xiang today were essentially this. Even without Senators requesting it later, they would gradually roll them out after grassroots management strength was enriched.

"How do you say we collect the Clan Tax?" Ai Zhixin asked, since he had promised to "research" and "suppressing clans" was a consistent policy of the Senate. Whether for Liu Xiang or the Administration Council, he had to come up with a plan to respond.

"This, well, is nothing more than following your view, Director Ai, starting from the path of Property Tax." Wang Qiyi was confident. "Although I haven't specifically investigated the local situation, combining historical conditions, the foundation of clan existence is nothing more than ancestral halls and clan properties, especially the latter. As long as we levy high tax rates on these two, we can effectively strike clan forces economically—at least weaken the clan's economic capacity."

In Wang Qiyi's view, both ancestral halls and various industries under clan names were easy to identify in basic situation investigations. Whether house deeds or land deeds, the basic situation could be understood clearly through "stamp duty rights confirmation." Collecting it was much easier than that nonsense Foot-binding Tax.

"Actually, if we really want to collect some Foot-binding Tax, it's not impossible," Ai Zhixin said. "We can levy a surcharge on embroidered shoes for bound-foot women sold locally. Pity most women's shoes here are made at home; there are basically few shoe shops selling embroidered shoes..."

"So there's completely no enforceability." Zhang Xiaoqi said.

"We won't mention this problem," Ai Zhixin said. "But what about the issue of refining 'Customs Industry' tax proposed by Mayor Liu today?" This was the second topic Liu Xiang gave to the Finance and Tax Bureau.

"What 'Customs Industry Tax'? Isn't it just 'Flower Donation'!" Wang Qiyi said.

"This collection isn't hard. The Senate has a very mature Yellow Ticket system in Hainan itself," Zhang Xiaoqi muttered. "We can continue to use it, adopting the taxation method for catering service industry, levying a fixed-amount tax—the main thing here is how to assess specific income."

Ai Zhixin shook his head: "No, Guangzhou's situation is much more complex. There are individual prostitutes and also very large brothels. Inside brothels are 'house owners' and 'guests,' and the latter include free bodies and those with pimps. The Police Bureau did a customs industry rectification earlier and hit many madams and pimps. The current situation is clearer than before, but we don't grasp enough of the specific business situation and ownership status inside. And Liu Xiang's attitude towards this industry is contradictory: wanting to limit development, yet wanting to squeeze oil from it, and also guaranteeing prostitutes' basic human rights..."

"Basic human rights? That's truly the best joke I heard today," Zhang Xiaoqi sprayed unceremoniously. "Since they are thinking about how to squeeze flesh money from whores, why set up a memorial arch! Truly hypocritical to the extreme!"

"That is so," Ai Zhixin said, "but now the Senate has a big business and increased expenses; calculating to open sources everywhere is also normal..."

Wang Qiyi stopped his wife from continuing to spray with his eyes and said: "This matter is complex; let's discuss it slowly."
