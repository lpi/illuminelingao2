# Chapter 90 - Peace Negotiation (2)

The Executive Committee discussed the remaining two issues. Most people felt that not disturbing the people was originally their aim, and there wasn't much difference between agreeing and not agreeing. The controversy was mainly on the second point: whether to release captives. Wu De and the people from the Architecture Team were resolutely opposed. The former had just trained them well and everything was relatively smooth. The latter, because the engineering volume was busy now, losing the labor team would greatly affect efficiency.

Others were also reluctant to give up these people. Finally, it was decided to only release those figures like small landlords and rich peasants. They didn't have enough bargaining chips to attract these people's submission for the time being. As for others, temporarily not release, in order to establish indigenous auxiliary forces as soon as possible.

After making this decision, Wu De combed through all captives overnight and listed about ten or so names that could be released, all figures like big households or rich peasants. Keeping these people was useless; might as well release them to obtain some realistic benefits.

Everyone discussed some terms again and set out a condition for negotiation. The next day, Zhang Youfu visited again with eight kinds of simple gifts, ostensibly thanking them for allowing the collection of corpses, but actually to sound out their tone.

Xi Yazhou then put forward his side's three demands:

1. Transmigrators can conduct business with local people at any location in this county, freely trading various commodities. The government and other people shall not obstruct.

2. Transmigrators can freely hire labor in the county.

3. Transmigrators have freedom of movement in the county.

At the same time, he expressed that regardless of whether the county agreed to these three articles, to show sincerity, they could release a part of people. He also proposed a list of people prepared to be released, asking them to see if there were any to be added. If they wanted to take people away immediately, people could be released here immediately. If nothing special, just bring some sedans and livestock to pick up people tomorrow.

Zhang Youfu naturally dared not make the decision on this matter, so he copied a copy of the personnel prepared to be released and the conditions each to take away.

Receiving these conditions, Wu Mingjin couldn't make up his mind either. Some things were easy to say, but some were really significant, especially this trading commodities—he faintly felt this was a bit like the conditions when the Red Hair People sent ships to request opening ports and conducting trade a few years ago. Could it be these people are also of the same group? So he hurriedly went to find Master Wang to discuss.

Master Wang pondered for a moment, drank a pot of strong tea, then made up his mind and whispered: "East Host, just agree."

Wu Mingjin shook his head and said: "I have two worries. First, if they follow the old trick of the Franks back then, relying on not leaving, taking Bairen as the city and Bopu as the port, this place will become a second Macao (Xiangshan Ao). The court will definitely not allow it. Second, although hiring labor is free, once they sail away in the future, wouldn't it create the sin of separating flesh and blood?"

Master Wang smiled: "East Host worries too much. The urgent matter right now is to appease the gentry and collect the autumn grain. After half a year or a year, move around in the province, seek a transfer. Whether it becomes Macao or not has nothing to do with the Master. As for separating flesh and blood—hiring labor is a matter of mutual consent. Going to work as servants for such people outside civilization, being taken overseas is also their own fault."

Wu Mingjin thought left and right, thought it had to be so, so he summoned Zhang Youfu, saying just promise these things to the 'Kun' bandits, but no written evidence should be left. Zhang Youfu understood tacitly, and went to summon the heads of various families waiting to redeem people, asking them to take out thank-you gifts.

Those families with members captured were originally anxious like ants on a hot pot, begging here and there, wanting to find someone to mediate with the pirates, willing to pay silver to redeem people, even planning to spare no expense as long as lives could be saved. It's just that this group of pirates had unknown origins and couldn't be contacted. Now hearing that the other party didn't want ransom and would release people tomorrow, asking any family to take out one more tael of silver felt like peeling a layer of skin from the body, painful to the heart. One vied with another to cry poor. All described themselves as miserable people who grew up eating coptis chinensis (bitter herb) every day. After talking until the first watch, there was still no clue. Zhang Youfu was very angry, had to wipe his face, threatening that if a suitable amount couldn't be discussed, he wouldn't go to Bairen Beach to pick up people tomorrow. "Tomorrow whoever wants to pick up people go yourself!" Saying this, he made a gesture of flicking his sleeves and leaving.

How could everyone let him go? All stopped him. Here County Deputy Magistrate Wu Ya also followed with fake comforting words. One played the red face, one played the white face. After saying good and bad, finally decided to ask everyone to take out six hundred taels of silver, one hundred bolts of Qiongzhou cloth (Note: cotton cloth produced locally in Hainan), four pigs, and one cow. Also take out thirty taels of silver as reward for Zhang Youfu. Silver and cloth were shared according to the size of each family's property. Everyone was satisfied with this total number, because if redeeming people, it would cost at least three or four times the money. After agreeing on the amount, everyone worried whether this number could satisfy Headman Xi. They decided to ask Zhang Youfu to go tomorrow, explain this amount, and if Xi Yazhou agreed, then send silver and cloth to pick up people.

The next day, Zhang Youfu took sedans and livestock to see Xi Yazhou. He told Xi Yazhou many difficult words on behalf of the big households, then said the amount of silver and cloth. Xi Yazhou not only didn't show intention of thinking it was too little, but said some appreciative words instead. Without waiting for the county to send silver and cloth, he directly released those small landlords and rich peasants.

This move further enhanced the gentry's good opinion of them. Even ordinary commoner small households, knowing their action, also felt these pirates were benevolent and righteous people, and heard they never burned, killed, or looted. Those with slightly bigger courage left the city and went home one after another—there were still many farm works waiting for them in the fields. After a few days, the refugees in the county seat actually scattered clean. The county seat changed from only opening the south gate for two or three hours originally to opening all three gates. The tense atmosphere that lasted for more than a month slowly subsided. After another few days, pedestrians on the roads who had been cut off appeared one after another, and there were also farmers working in the fields near Bairen Beach.

"Peace is indeed beautiful." Xiao Zishan stood on the watchtower, saying intoxicatedly.

"Peace is temporary." Bei Wei said with a sullen face behind him. The hunting plan he advocated, after two adjustments, was originally ready to set off, but was announced to be temporarily shelved because of this peace negotiation. These days, he trained Ye Mengyan and the group of young lads who kept clamoring to be special forces with the energy of "Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth, Sun, Metal" (Note: implying every day of the week, no rest). The screams of these ten or so people could be heard on the training ground every day.

ATF Xue Ziliang also painfully realized how to change his destiny during the process of driving the bulldozer. He noticed Bei Wei's training course and slipped to the training ground after work every day. At first, Bei Wei was not very willing to pay attention to him, but after he expressed a few very professional opinions in the training course, the two often began to exchange some opinions. Xue Ziliang took the opportunity to show a hand in front of Bei Wei. Several beautiful tactical movements and excellent marksmanship made this former reconnaissance company commander look at him with new eyes. At this time, he revealed his trump card: before joining ATF, he served in the US Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance (FORCE RECON) and participated in the Iraq War.

"You see, I am also a veteran." Xue Ziliang looked at Bei Wei affectionately with eyes full of loneliness. Thus, the souls of the two former scouts from China and the US oscillated and struck sparks of resonance. The expressions of the two were so full of men's fortitude and tenderness that there were legends of Brokeback Mountain among the special forces trainees that day.

Next, the exchanges between the two on the training ground became more frequent. Between peers, especially peers who respect each other, there is a lot to say. Although there were many majors in the Military Team, even people from armored corps and naval vessels, he was the only one in the Military Team with a reconnaissance major. Usually, except for chief officers of infantry units like He Ming and Xi Yazhou who could talk about some professional things, there was nothing to talk about with others. Now with a person like Xue Ziliang, there were quite a few common topics. The discussion between the two from special forces operations, tactics to various military issues became increasingly deep. Of course, rumors about the two also spread like wildfire.

Bei Wei himself was still unaware. When He Ming, as an old comrade, euphemistically suggested to him: as a main leading cadre of the Military Team, pay attention to influence in private life, he still found it difficult to understand: how could a person who never showed kindness to girls have rumors about lifestyle style. Speaking of which, he couldn't stand Xi Yazhou being too warm with girls!

Until finally this rumor reached his ears, he suddenly realized that private life issues were not limited to relationships between men and women. after his face turned from red to green and then pale, he ran out. Xi Yazhou hurriedly led people to follow out, deeply afraid that he would do something stupid on impulse. After some investigation, Bei Wei announced in the special forces training team that each member had to do an extra 200 push-ups after training ended that day, until the rumors about him and Xue Ziliang disappeared.

However, this did not affect the friendship between him and Xue Ziliang. Xue Weini (Note: Nickname or typo for Xue Ziliang? "Xue Weini" appears here. Maybe Winnie? Or typo. I will keep "Xue Weini" as per source) used his innate keen insight into human sophistication as a Chinese to find the way of survival again in this once strange environment.

For most transmigrators, the biggest change brought by the easing with local people was shown on the dining table. When Wu Nanhai spiritedly wrote the three words "Red Braised Pork" on the blackboard of today's supply in the cafeteria, the newly built counter of the cafeteria was almost crushed by people squeezing.
