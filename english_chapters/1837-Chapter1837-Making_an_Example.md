# Chapter 1837 - Making an Example

Zhao Gui nodded quickly, repeated the instructions several times, and then led his men away.

After Zhao Gui left with his men, Li Ziyu ordered the main gate tightly closed and guarded by soldiers. He then gathered all the personnel in the courtyard. The police had already gained a general understanding of the courtyard's situation during their previous visits and investigations, so Li Ziyu knew exactly what he was doing. He separated the crowd into groups: *laoju* (prostitutes), *doufenshui* (servants/guards), miscellaneous workers, *majie* (housemaids) and servant girls, and *pipazai* (young trainees), arranging for them to be guarded separately.

He detained Yao-sao, Muyun, and Huang Xiang one by one for questioning. There was no need to ask much about He Xiaoyue's matter; that was already irrefutable evidence. The focus was on investigating whether there was any "private purchasing of *pipazai*."

Questioned separately, the three naturally dared not conceal anything. Without much effort, they confessed that some days ago, Han Qiaojie had indeed bought a girl, about ten years old, a local of Guangzhou, from a human trafficker. Her appearance was roughly similar to Mingnu's. At first, Han Qiaojie didn't really want her, but later, for some reason, she suddenly bought her.

"...Master Yu, your brilliance is clear," Huang Xiang bowed, his face full of servility. "It's not that the Madam didn't know the Great Song's rules. She refused a few times, but later, somehow, she had the trafficker bring the child back."

"What is this child's name?" Li Ziyu asked casually, feigning indifference.

"I think she's called Mingnu," Huang Xiang said. "I only saw her once when the trafficker brought her in."

Li Ziyu couldn't suppress the excitement in his heart. It seemed Ninth Master's information was accurate! He immediately followed up: "Where is this girl now?"

"I truly don't know," Huang Xiang said. "After *pipazai* are bought, they are all managed and taught by Miss Muyun. *Doufenshui* aren't allowed to ask questions. And they usually stay in the back courtyard; unless summoned, they don't come to the front..."

Asking Muyun, she confirmed that Mingnu was indeed sent to her for training. She had been in the courtyard for the past few days, but suddenly disappeared yesterday.

"...The Madam told Yao-sao to take her away. Where she was taken, this servant truly doesn't know. This servant dares not lie." Muyun was very tactful; as soon as she entered, she knelt on the ground to reply, presenting a gentle, submissive, and pitiable appearance.

Li Ziyu then asked the older girls among the *pipazai*. They all said they had indeed seen Mingnu, but she had disappeared yesterday. They dared not ask Muyun.

Having gained a general understanding, Li Ziyu then had Yao-sao brought in for questioning.

As expected, Yao-sao tried every means to deny it as soon as she opened her mouth, refusing to admit there was a Mingnu in the courtyard. Li Ziyu questioned her repeatedly, but she resolutely denied the matter. Li Ziyu had experience with this; he knew that kind words were mostly useless against such "battle-hardened" market shrews. He ordered her handcuffed and hung from the beam, with only her toes touching the ground.

Unexpectedly, when Yao-sao was a *laoju*, she had often been tortured by the madam because her "business" was poor. Being beaten with boards, kneeling on chains, balancing lamps, drinking sesame oil... when it came to enduring torture, she was considered a top performer on Music Workshop Street. This little method had no effect on her. After hanging her for nearly two hours, seeing that Lian Nishang had arrived, Yao-sao was sweating profusely and twitching all over, but still insisted she knew nothing about Mingnu. Li Ziyu was both anxious and angry, but he had neither the authority nor the skill for torture interrogation.

"This woman must know some secret, otherwise she wouldn't keep her mouth shut like this for a little girl," Lian Nishang inferred immediately after hearing his report.

"Section Chief's brilliant insight..."

"Hehe," Lian Nishang sneered a few times. "Brilliant insight is saying too much. But Fangchun Court is so bold, continuing to commit crimes against the wind. It seems the measure of whipping the madams thirty times and fining them five hundred taels of silver for the previous few houses was too light. This time, we have to double down."

"Does the Section Chief mean..." Li Ziyu rejoiced secretly. To find Mingnu, and conveniently give Zeng Juan's former brother-in-law and that adulterous couple a hard time—the bigger the case blew up, the better.

"On-site office! Handle it right here," Lian Nishang said. "Just right to give all the brothels here a reminder."

Because she had taken the fall for Zhuo Yifan, she was isolated and investigated for a period after the case ended. Although she was later released and restored to work, the comment "lacking vigilance" had been entered into her file. Although Lian Nishang couldn't see her own file materials, her subsequent "promotion" to Guangzhou seemed to fully prove that this was a demotion. Her heart was holding a ball of fire.

But when she arrived in Guangzhou, she was the deputy chief of the Household Registration Section, having no direct relation to various cases. Later, appointing her as the deputy leader of the Rectification of the Sex Industry Task Force gave her a chance to flex her muscles.

She had originally wanted to catch an "example" to rectify thoroughly, but suffered from no one hitting the muzzle of the gun. Fangchun Court was not only buying civilian girls privately but also forcing free people into prostitution. It was exactly the right target.

"Yes, we must investigate and punish strictly!" Li Ziyu quickly echoed. "No matter what evil dealings are hidden in this Fangchun Court, we must dig them out!"

Lian Nishang didn't know the petty schemes in his heart. Feeling that although he came from an old military officer family, he worked hard and his attitude towards the old society was resolute, she couldn't help but have a bit more favorable impression of him.

The Executive Deputy Leader of the "Clean Up the Sex Industry Working Group" had spoken; the tone was set. The resources Lian Nishang could deploy were much greater. With a few orders, she transferred several more National Army soldiers and police, not only surrounding Fangchun Court tightly but also posting sentries at the intersection of Music Workshop Street. Although passage wasn't prohibited, seeing this scene, how could the masters coming for pleasure have any elegant interest left? Even those already here for wine and tea hurriedly left. The various brothels couldn't help but curse secretly; they were tossing about again!

This was exactly the effect Mu Min wanted. Not only severe punishment but also "collective responsibility." She clearly instructed in the work meeting: because the brothel industry itself is full of gray areas—strictly speaking, even in the Great Ming, many actions of brothels were illegal. But for years, brothels had run rampant, and it had even become the "rules." to make the entire industry realize the seriousness of the "law," not only must violators be strictly punished, but the cost of breaking the law must also be amplified through collective responsibility.

Since they were making an example, the scene was spread out. The flower hall, originally full of orioles and swallows, singing fans and dancing shirts, was cleared into a temporary office for handling the case. All decorations were removed, and chairs and chart boards were set up. Within the courtyard, all of Han Qiaojie's cronies were arrested and detained in one courtyard, while the rest were sent back to their quarters, forbidden to enter or leave or walk around the courtyard.

The detained cronies of Han Qiaojie naturally had personnel sent by the Interrogation Section to question them. Others were interviewed one by one by police and temporarily assigned female cadres from the naturalized citizens, requiring everyone to "expose and report" back-to-back. The focus was for the *laoju* to report the madam and the various illegal activities in the courtyard.

Li Ziyu knew from the situation that they were going to persecute Fangchun Court to death, and he rejoiced secretly. Although Yao-sao could withstand the torture in the brothel, she couldn't withstand the cruel hands of the few retained yamen runners in the Interrogation Section—before long, she was weeping urine, sweat, and tears, crying that she was willing to confess.

"Speak carefully, where exactly did Mingnu go?"

"Where Mingnu went, this servant truly doesn't know," Yao-sao trembled all over, prostrating on the ground. "Yesterday, the Madam gave this servant a slip of paper with a birth date and horoscope, asking this servant to select a *pipazai* in this courtyard with matching horoscope and compatible birth date, and take her to..."

Speaking to this point, she seemed to have been frightened by something and suddenly shut her mouth. Two interrogators made a move to step forward, but Lian Nishang waved her hand to stop them. She said: "Yao-sao, although you are Han Qiaojie's confidant, you are also of *laoju* origin. Haven't you suffered enough from madams and turtle-servants in the first half of your life? These whip marks and scars all over your body, do you still want to thank the madam for bestowing them?"

Yao-sao lowered her head and panted, watching the few Aussie yamen runners eyeing her covetously. She knew these people were originally old hands from the soap squads of the former Ming yamens, each one cruel and black-hearted. Just a look from this Aussie woman in front of her could make her life worse than death. However, if she confessed, she wouldn't be able to eat this bowl of rice afterward. Just as she was helpless, Lian Nishang became impatient. With a glance, several retained runners immediately threw a set of finger crushers fiercely in front of her, rubbing their fists and wiping their palms as they prepared to come up. Yao-sao couldn't hold on any longer, repeatedly saying she was willing to confess, stating that Mingnu was taken to Yuewan's courtyard.

"Yuewan?!"

"Yes, she... she... is the girl Master Liang bought the first night with," Yao-sao whispered.

"Is she in the courtyard?"

Huang Xiang, who was waiting by the side to assist in the trial and was already so scared his legs were soft, hurriedly came up to report: "Ever since Miss Yuewan was *shoulong* (de-virginated/bought out) by Master Liang, she has lived alone in a separate courtyard. Although it is said to be in our courtyard, it actually has its own separate gate for entry and exit. The servants are also sent by the Liang family. Whether she is in or not, we truly aren't clear."

Lian Nishang frowned and asked, "Which Master Liang?"

"It is Liang Cunhou, Master Liang."

When he spoke, he emphasized the three words "Master Liang." Because Liang Cunhou's family was not only first-class gentry in this city but also had a great relationship with the Senate. The Cihui Hall that Purple Lighting originally opened in Guangzhou had received strong support from the Liang family. Later, when Proprietor Guo did business in Guangzhou, he was also very close to the Liang family—it was only after the Australians pressed on Guangzhou city and burned the Five Rams Station that this relationship gradually cooled. But with this past history, the Liang family was still treated with courtesy by the Australians, considered important "United Front targets."

With identities like Lian Nishang and Li Ziyu, whether in the past or now, they were far inferior to the Liang family. As soon as Huang Xiang mentioned "Master Liang," Li Ziyu understood the other party's meaning. If it were according to the old rules, this would be over; no one would mention the word Yuewan again.

"Since she is still a girl in your courtyard, she naturally must undergo questioning," Lian Nishang said. "Send someone immediately to summon her!"

Li Ziyu, knowing the connections involved, took a step forward and whispered:

"Section Chief Lian, this Master Liang was a guest of honor of Head Guo in the past, and the current Chiefs have also met him. You must be cautious..."
