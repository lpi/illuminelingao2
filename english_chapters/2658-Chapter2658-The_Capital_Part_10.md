# Chapter 2658: The Capital (Part 10)

"If it is so, that is best!" Both assistant managers expressed their agreement. Li Rufeng, however, was somewhat skeptical and asked, "Are you confident?"

"I can't say completely, but there is always some hope." Wu Kaidi had an idea by now. "This matter should not be delayed. We will split up to act. Masters Li and Liao will investigate the matter of the Master's disappearance; I will go to Shuntian Prefecture to find acquaintances to test the waters and see if there is any room for maneuver. As for the two assistant managers, stabilize the bank's plate first. Do the receivables and payables normally for now..."

Assistant Manager Xiao said, "If we cannot suspend business, the counter can support three to five days at most. This is under the premise that the big account holders don't come to make a run..."

The deposits of big account holders ranged from a few thousand to over ten thousand. If luck was bad and a withdrawal came, it would force the counter to death. The big account holders must be stabilized first, and one of Delong's main client groups was the eunuchs in the palace.

The group of eunuchs had always been known for their greed. From the Director of Ceremonial down to the petty eunuchs without rank, all considered amassing wealth and savings as their capability. Come to speak of it, this was not surprising. Eunuchs were rootless people without children or families; the only thing they could rely on was this gold and silver. Therefore, they all regarded money as their life. If a run really broke out, it would be a time bomb for Delong.

Even if Leng Ningyun were here, he would not be confident facing such a situation, let alone now that his whereabouts were unknown. It was no wonder Wu Kaidi placed his hope on "sealing the shop."

Wu Kaidi sighed, "If only we could think of a method to stabilize the depositors."

Assistant Manager Xiao frowned and pondered for a moment, saying, "The minds of Delong's big clients can be divided into three types. The first type only seeks profit and interest. The second type worries about the floating instability of the court situation and fears being convicted and having their homes confiscated, so they split their wealth into two places to save a retreat step beforehand. The third type knows a little about the inside story of the Australian Song and intends to convey funds in advance, seeking to preserve their lives and families in the future."

Liao Sanniang said from the side, "For this third type of client, we can reveal some information to them. When the Australian Song army heads north in the future, tell them absolutely not to misjudge the wind direction."

Assistant Manager Xiao hesitated for a moment and said to Li Rufeng, "After going out, I will immediately split up with the fellows to visit the various clients. These latter two types of clients can be appeased, but I am afraid this first type..."

Wu Kaidi sucked his teeth hard and nodded. "Ransom money, I will try my best to raise it. Delong should be fine in the short term. Delong's big clients are all cabinet ministers in the court, big shots in the wild, and noble eunuchs in the palace. Protecting Delong is protecting their own fortunes. But if the matter drags on for too long, it is hard to guarantee there won't be unexpected changes..."

Li Rufeng and Liao Sanniang bowed again to Wu Kaidi and the assistant managers, saying, "We rely entirely on everyone's planning."

Manager Wei said, "How will the two Eunuchs Yang view this matter? They are also shareholders."

Assistant Manager Xiao sniffed scornfully. "Those two? Won't they hurry to send people over to withdraw silver? Could it be you still expect them to overcome the difficulties with us? Relying on them is better than relying on the Liaohai Firm..."

"Master Li's Liaohai Firm has solid strength, but they won't give us tens of thousands in cash for no reason..."

Countless thoughts swirled in Wu Kaidi's mind at this moment. If one were to speak of merchants in the capital who were willing to support them and could mobilize large sums of silver, there was indeed only Li Luoyou's Liaohai Firm Beijing Branch. However, since the Senate captured Liangguang, Master Li's attitude towards them had become much colder. Although business dealings had not been cut off, Master Leng had invited Li Luoyou to dinner several times, but was refused very politely by the other party.

Now that they were in imminent danger, nine out of ten chances were that Li Luoyou would not be willing to wade into this muddy water.

However, compared to the Shanxi Houses, this road still had a possibility worth trying.

Wu Kaidi said, "Old Xiao, Old Wei, this path might as well be tried. It's better than us sitting and... sitting idly. Liaohai Firm has earned a lot of silver relying on the Senate in these years; it can be considered sharing glory and disgrace. If they really leave us in the lurch, I'm afraid they won't have the face to discuss business with the Senate in the future."

"We have to do this." Although the two verbally agreed, the expressions on their faces clearly showed they weren't too confident.

Seeing that Liao Sanniang had handled things on her side properly, Li Rufeng coughed heavily to draw back everyone's attention and said loudly, "Let's discuss proper business."

Li Rufeng pressed the armrest, leaned his body towards Wu Kaidi, and asked, "Mister Wu, has this matter been reported to Guangzhou?"

Although Wu Kaidi still had some grudges against Li Rufeng's conduct just now, he knew this was not the time to be petty and throw a tantrum. Suppressing the unhappiness in his heart, he replied, "Reported. Only the telegram box cannot transmit this far. I fear it will be difficult to have instructions in a short time."

Li Rufeng nodded, stood up, and said clearly, "Even if Guangzhou sends someone to take over the Beijing Station, a round trip is four thousand *li*. It will take quite some time. Person may not necessarily arrive in ten days or half a month."

Li Rufeng glanced at Liao Sanniang and continued, "On the way back, Sanniangzi and I discussed a few regulations. Now we bring them out for everyone to consult together."

Everyone bowed together and said yes.

Liao Sanniang spoke first, "I discussed with the Chief Escort. Since the government has not made a move, we can know it is not done by the Factory or Guard. Master Leng also has no enemies in Beijing. The competing banks absolutely do not have such ruthless means. To use such methods, it must be major bandits."

Wu Kaidi was stunned and said, "What they seek is..."

Li Rufeng interfaced from the side, "Most likely for wealth."

Hearing this, everyone looked at each other and couldn't help whispering.

Liao Sanniang continued, "This kind of thing happens in both the north and south; it is not rare. In Guangxi, the Yao and Zhuang people rob people in broad daylight to demand ransom, called 'Duo Jin' [Falling into Prohibition?]; in the north, it is called 'Capturing for Ransom.' To spend so much effort to investigate Master Leng's background is truly calculated. Since the bandits have rare goods in hand, how could they waste them in vain? They will definitely contact us. Masters, please be calm and patient; there will certainly be news shortly."

Li Rufeng nodded in agreement and took over the conversation, saying, "Firstly, the most urgent thing, useless to say, is naturally saving the person. If the bandits are truly seeking wealth, we must prepare in advance to prevent being caught off guard. The Australian Song has a saying: Problems that can be solved with money are not problems. If we can avoid using weapons and risk losing a large sum of money and goods to redeem Master Leng's safe return, even if we bear some responsibility, we can account for it."

Li Rufeng paused here, pondered for a moment, slowly turned the walnuts in his hand, and continued, "In handling such hostage cases, the government has never had a precedent of paying ransom to redeem people and letting bandits go unpunished. Often, the bandits and hostages are both killed together. The bailiffs and petty officials usually also use this excuse to extort the victim's family and blackmail for money. Therefore, we must absolutely not pin our hopes on the government. They want to catch people; we want to save people. The original intentions are different, and it is hard to achieve both. We cannot sit and wait with bound hands; we must go all out to rescue Master Leng. After we disperse later, Sanniangzi and I will send people to find the leaders and heads of those beggars, rascals, bare-sticks, and rowdies to spread nets everywhere to inquire. The news of these marketplace characters is the most informed. This is a business of drilling, poking, spying, and splashing hot blood. You modest gentlemen naturally do not know the filthy and nasty tricks in this *Jianghu*. Doing my part, this matter can only be borne by Sanniangzi and me. But I must ask Mister Wu to flow some silver water over to support various expenses. Such matters require spending money like splashing water; one cannot be stingy. We also need to raise the ransom in advance."

Wu Kaidi and Assistant Managers Xiao and Wei looked at each other, looking troubled. "Although the Leng residence has some silver, it is not much. As for Delong's working capital, it is not good to divert it..."

Li Rufeng followed up closely, saying, "No matter how hard it is, we must find a way."

Liao Sanniang also turned her head at this time and said to Wu Kaidi, "Secondly, we need to ask Mister Wu to come forward to deal with various official matters with Wanping County and Shuntian Prefecture, bribe the superiors and inferiors, and inquire about news from the government. Mister Wu, is there anyone in the Leng residence who can act as the suffering host [plaintiff]?"

Wu Kaidi leaned forward slightly and said, "Master Leng has a personal secretary named Hexiang. On ordinary days, she organizes documents and takes care of Master Leng's daily life. Externally, we only say Master Leng's official wife is at home and did not follow him. Hexiang is Master Leng's managing concubine. It will be fine for Hexiang to come forward to handle all matters."

Li Rufeng nodded and said, "Good."

Then Li Rufeng turned to the several managers of Delong and said, "Thirdly, we must trouble the managers to stabilize Delong's situation. We need to use money, so the bank cannot have more trouble. But in this business management, I am like a rolling pin blowing fire—I know nothing. I entrust this to you all. Li bows to you here." After speaking, he bowed deeply and made a big obeisance to the few people from Delong.

Assistant Manager Xiao and the others hurriedly scrutinized their hands to return the bow, saying, "Dare not, dare not, we should, we should."

Just as they were speaking, someone suddenly came from outside to report that Head Constable Qi of the Shuntian Prefecture Fast Squad had come.

Everyone was startled upon hearing this. It was Wu Kaidi who kept his cool and instructed everyone to wait here while he went out to deal with it himself.

Li Rufeng did not mind. He was quite familiar with the government offices: it was proper for the Fast Squad to come to detain witnesses. That the Head Constable came personally, firstly, showed that this matter was of great importance; secondly, it also indicated that they could "talk about the weight" [negotiate terms]—that is to say, there was room for maneuver in this matter. Otherwise, this Head Constable would have long since rolled his eyes to the sky, disowned all relations, and handled official business according to official principles.

What he cared about most now was exactly why Leng Ningyun had run out of the city with his personal attendants without using the escort agency's protection—given his personality and principles of conduct, this was an extremely unusual thing.

If they knew why he went out, there would be a thread of a clue to finding the person.

However, Leng Ningyun's two personal page boys had both been killed. Although Wu Kaidi was a confidant, he could not enter the inner rooms on ordinary days to attend by his side. The only clues were the two chamber maids in Leng Ningyun's room.

Of these two chamber maids, one was a Life Secretary allocated from Lingao, named "Hexiang" in the Beijing Station. After coming to the Beijing Station, she also served as Leng's Confidential Secretary; important documents all passed through her hands. The other was bought after arriving in the capital. The name was much more vulgar, called "Yanhong." Leng Ningyun couldn't be bothered to change it. Although the latter did not know Leng Ningyun's true identity, she also belonged to those who had "received great grace." Having gone through a "background investigation" by Heliansheng, she was just an ordinary girl with a clean background. There was nothing suspicious about her loyalty.

However, they served Leng Ningyun in his daily life and should know quite a lot. Li Rufeng thought he should start with these two people first.
