# Chapter 2694: The Capital (Part 46)

"Did he really say that?"

"Yes, the lowly one heard clearly and distinctly." Zhou Lezhi said.

Wang Yehao nodded to express satisfaction. It seemed he didn't need to expend much effort; the Shorn-hair Thieves' own evil deeds made this Hearthstone Daoist detest them. In this way, he wasn't afraid of him running back. The "Lingao Bandit Situation" written by Gou Chengxuan also had quite a lot of black material; he could also show it to him.

Now he was in no hurry for the act of "Mengde's Songstress" [Cao Cao keeping Xu Shu's mother? Or just using women/pleasure? Context implies keeping him]. Besides predicting the future, this Hearthstone Immortal could also bring him many other benefits, and had offered quite a few ideas on rehabilitation. Some were close to empty talk, but the angles were novel and could inspire lines of thought.

This was a capable person. Must rope him into hand!

Zhou Lezhi didn't have so many calculations; he just felt that starting from returning from the countryside, the Teacher was greatly different from before, becoming silent and reticent. Everyday besides giving him lessons, at night he also didn't frolic with Jieyi anymore, but closed the door to write books.

Manuscripts piled up continuously. Originally relying on Zhou Lezhi to copy and organize, but the Teacher disliked that this would occupy Zhou Lezhi's lesson time, so he let Liu Zhao find five book copyists.

Book copyists were craftsmen in printing workshops specially responsible for copying paper patterns. Not only was the copying neat and fast, but most were also illiterate—this was also a quite rare matter. Wang Yehao felt this was best, avoiding the leakage of "Australian Supreme Learning." He even specially instructed to copy an extra set.

Zhou Lezhi's work was to proofread whether the copying had errors. Speaking honestly, he felt even if the copyists were literate it would be of no use, because the things the Teacher wrote, if not passed through his teaching, were mostly unintelligible.

The copied documents were sent to Wang Yehao's study. Originally he thought what he wrote were "Spell Texts," unexpectedly all were Chinese characters. Except that the font was mostly vulgar forms [Simplified], the language was close to vernacular, having nothing special actually.

It was just that most things he wrote belonged to the nature of recognizing every character when holding it to read, but not knowing what touched upon what when connected. This was somewhat awkward.

Some he presumably knew were mathematics and Gewu [investigation of things/science]; some he completely didn't know the why, for example "Outline of Principles of Political Economy"; another piece "17th Century World Geography and Nations," treating it as reading material for hunting novelty and leisure was actually not bad, but had no meaning—after all, no one cared how many countries these Red Hair Europa barbarians had or how many kings; "Principles of Mechanics," on it were all various kinds of machines...

"These are the Supreme Learning Hearthstone Daoist spoke of?" He was somewhat disbelieving, specially finding Zhou Lezhi.

"Yes, the Teacher said exactly so."

"What kind of Supreme Learning are these!" Master Wang slandered secretly in his belly, but these words couldn't be said openly, so he asked again, "Did he ever write books regarding spells and secret methods?"

The answer naturally disappointed him. Master Wang stared deadly at Zhou Lezhi, feeling this youth had changed somewhat, seemingly not that loyal anymore.

Forgiving that he also couldn't raise wind [cause trouble]. Although this Zhou Lezhi was an orphan, his clan was right in Guangdong. Exterminating the family was just a matter of raising a hand; presumably he also understood.

Moreover, this kid was already hot with Hearthstone Immortal; rashly swapping him out would only arouse the Immortal's dissatisfaction. Immediately he spoke a few warm sentences, letting him help the Teacher write books well.

Sending away Zhou Lezhi, Wang Yehao looked at the candle fire expressionlessly; only after a long while did he open his mouth to ask Liu Sha:

"Heavenly Book Spell Texts, are there any clues?"

"The lowly one inquired in many ways; no one recognizes them."

"Act carefully; must not leak the wind [news]."

"Master rest assured, subordinate has own methods. It's just..." Liu Sha paused, looking like he wanted to speak but stopped.

"Just speak straight, no need for concern."

"Master, subordinate is bold: these Heavenly Book Spell Texts only Mr. Zhou recognizes; why not force him to speak out the method of cracking?"

"Sigh!" Wang Yehao sighed a long breath, silent for a long while before opening his mouth to say: "Since it concerns Heavenly Book Spell Texts, this official won't hide from you. This matter is huge; having heard it, keep it in your heart, absolutely cannot speak with others."

"Subordinate will remember respectfully."

"Tianqi Year 6, Wanggongchang's matter, do you remember?"

"Remember. The official gazette said it was caused by gunpowder catching fire."

"Hehehehe..." Hearing this, Wang Yehao couldn't help laughing out loud. "You say what kind of gunpowder can have such a battle array?"

"Subordinate is stupid; hope Master points out."

"That day this official inspected the neighborhood and saw Mr. Zhou within the ruined walls."

"Mr. Zhou is a person of the Capital City?"

Wang Yehao suddenly had a stern look in his eyes; his words revealed a strand of solemn killing chill: "Saw Mr. Zhou's human head."

"What does Master mean?"

"Just a human head, suspended in mid-air, vanished in an instant."

This matter sounded too horrifying; Liu Sha didn't know how to answer for a good while, asking only like talking in sleep: "Re... ally?"

"This matter of strange forces and chaotic spirits, this official originally didn't believe, but this matter couldn't be faked." Wang Yehao calmed his mood, looking at Liu Sha who was still somewhat dazed, and said, "This person being vulgar with little literary grace is true; Iron Mouth predicting fate is also true. Depth is hard to fathom; cannot act rashly. Zhongda [Sima Yi] said, Kongming [Zhuge Liang] never took risks in his life. If this official doesn't have ten-tenths certainty, definitely cannot play strong with him."

"It was subordinate being rash."

"No harm." Wang Yehao lowered his volume, speaking mysteriously, "Now my intent is also not on the Heavenly Book. Arriving in Guangzhou and taking a look, the Shorn-hair Thief power is already formed; in the future they will definitely become the Court's confidant great trouble. This Hearthstone Immortal, ten out of ten, has a huge relationship with Shorn-hair Thieves. For the Court to pacify the Thieves, this person will surely have great use."

"Subordinate understands!"

"This official came to Guangzhou to inspect; although Shorn-hair Thieves have already retreated, Guangzhou's officials every one fear Thieves like tigers. Probably there are still quite a few secretly receiving Shorn-hair Thieves' bribes. To deal with Shorn-hair Thieves, relying on local yamens is unreliable. How is the matter instructed to you handled?"

"Already recruited twenty-plus brothers, all good hands."

"Silver, this official gives you; but people must be useful." Wang Yehao stared at Liu Sha once. "At critical juncture, do not ruin affairs because of people, delaying war opportunities..."

"Delaying war opportunities," these four characters were enough to make people lose heads. Liu Sha naturally understood the meaning within.

"Master rest assured; subordinate knows the stakes within."

"You go."

Liu Sha didn't leave immediately but reported again: "Master, subordinate has a matter to inform..."

"Oh, speak for me to hear."

Liu Sha said he had a brother he knew, who was a person of the Guangzhou Liang family, saying Liang Cunhou had the heart to deal with Shorn-hair Thieves and was also secretly recruiting Jianghu Good Fellows.

"...Heard Liang family is Guangzhou's powerful gentry, with extremely great power locally. If Master can get his assistance, great matters can be accomplished."

What kind of person Liang Cunhou was, Master Wang naturally understood. But he had long heard this Liang Cunhou had collusion with Shorn-hair Thieves; Guangzhou City's biggest charity hall was co-founded by his family and Manager Guo.

Such a person actually wanted to deal with Shorn-hair Thieves? Master Wang was somewhat disbelieving.

"Truly such a matter?"

"Indeed!" Liu Sha nodded, whispering, "Liang family internally also has a monitoring lieutenant—it's Eastern Depot's person."

"Eastern Depot?"

"Yes," he noticed the look of worry and fear appearing in Master Wang's eyes, and busily said, "This brother although was originally ordered by Eastern Depot to infiltrate the Liang family, after the Emperor removed official monitoring, he had nowhere to go, so he still remained in the Liang Residence to serve."

"Oh." Wang Yehao let out a sigh of relief. Because after the Emperor ascended the throne, he immediately removed official monitoring; didn't think after a few years he unexpectedly sent people again.

Activities these few years were frequent; if really detected by Eastern Depot and poked to the Emperor, he was afraid he would go to the Imperial Prison to be "beaten while questioned."

Thinking of this, he involuntarily broke out in cold sweat.

Liu Sha continued to lower his voice, "This Eastern Depot detective lieutenant is also our Jinyiwei brother, so subordinate contacted him through a reliable middleman."

"You speak!"

"According to him, ever since Viceroy Wang failed in the campaign against Shorn-hair Thieves, Liang Cunhou has always regretted collaborating with Shorn-hair Thieves initially—it's just this involved massive interests, connected to the whole Liang family, so he didn't make a cut with Shorn-hair Thieves."

"Speaking so, the Liang family has property with the Shorn-hair Thieves?"

"Exactly so. Not only *Cihuitang*, but also *Zig's* [Zizhenzhai/Purple] several firms; heard Liang family all has shares."

"So it was like this!" Wang Yehao thought Shorn-hair Thieves had the reputation of turning stone into gold locally; for the Liang family to have shares, the richness of annual returns went without saying. No wonder they couldn't make up their minds.

"But Liang Cunhou feels Shorn-hair Thieves have become Guangdong's disease, and sooner or later will also be the Court's confidant trouble, so he has been collecting Thief Situation in secret, preparing in advance..."

Wang Yehao understood Liu Sha's meaning; this person could be cooperated with.

The Liang family was a famous local powerful clan in Guangzhou Prefecture; influence was deeply rooted and intertwined. If his help could be obtained, dealing with Shorn-hair Thieves would get twice the result with half the effort.

"Speaking so, I should meet him once."

Fortunately, for a high regional official taking office, visiting local gentry was also a matter that should be done. He summoned Jin Wenchi, letting him pull the thread. Sure enough, within a few days, the Liang family sent an invitation card, inviting Wang Yehao to a banquet.

At the banquet, Wang Yehao mentioned Shorn-hair Thieves harming Guangdong, asking if Liang Cunhou had any countermeasures.

"Speaking of Shorn-hair Thieves, Student can also be counted as their benefactor." Liang Cunhou spoke of past events with a bitter smile. "At that time I shouldn't have been confused by them, and also pitied their difficulty in making a living overseas, sending a greeting card, and also co-founding *Cihuitang* with them to take in refugees. How could I think, raising a tiger to cause trouble!"

"Mending the pen after sheep are lost, it is still not late."

Liang Cunhou and Wang Yehao hit it off instantly. Liang Cunhou wanted to make up for his "faults" of those years; his attitude was especially active, revealing that he had secretly set up a library collection building at home, specially collecting Shorn-hair Thieves' various books, court gazettes, and various information. He also organized some scholars to form a *Yuyuan* Society, specially responsible for studying them. If Lord Wang was interested, they could exchange what they had.

"There is such a matter? Are the people reliable?"

"Whether reliable or not Student dares not say, but they are all people obsessed with *Ao* Learning." Liang Cunhou laughed, "Student also wouldn't say studying *Ao* Learning is for dealing with Shorn-hair Thieves."

"There are scholars obsessed with *Ao* Learning?" This made Wang Yehao somewhat surprised.

"Exactly. Discussing practical craft techniques, *Ao* Learning indeed has superior points." Liang Cunhou sighed, "If it can be used by the Court, it would also be a fortunate thing. Pity Shorn-hair Thieves hold it very strictly; one cannot peek one or two of it!"
