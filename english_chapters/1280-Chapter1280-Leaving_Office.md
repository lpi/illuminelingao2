# Chapter 1280: Leaving Office

"You mean we let the mountain bandit become the Prefect, and then expose him?" Wang Ding asked.

"Exactly. Intercepting the mountain bandit was originally a troublesome matter. Now we let him go ahead and do it, and expose him after he takes office." Li Yan said, "Mountain bandits killing officials is not too rare, but impersonating officials is rare. Old Wu exposing him is equivalent to making a contribution right after taking office—the reputation of being a capable official is secured."

"The problem is that his contribution has little value," Wang Ding said, "It's unlikely they will promote him immediately. I think it's better to let Old Wu use this to threaten him, holding the fake Prefect hostage to command Leizhou."

Jiang Shan shook his head: "The mountain bandit can just walk away. Why should he be controlled by you? You have to know that once this matter is exposed, heads will roll. He can still distinguish which is more important. Even if the other party agrees for a moment, there are too many variables. Not appropriate."

"I share this view." Li Yan said, "Actually, you should think this way: once Old Wu exposes the fake Prefect, won't the position of Prefect be vacant?"

"Wu Mingjin acting as Prefect? The Vice Prefect is the Vice Prefect of Leizhou!"

"Can't we make him die of a sudden illness?" Li Yan said lightly, "Who else can go up now?"

"Whether it's a Prefect or a Vice Prefect, the court will always send a new official to take over. They can't let Old Wu act as agent forever, right?"

"Appointing a Prefect has to go through the Ministry of Personnel. Here the Emperor is far away. By the time the documents are processed and the new Prefect comes to take office, at least a year will have passed. As for the Vice Prefect, Leizhou has always been a remote and evil prefecture where epidemics are prevalent. It's uncertain if he might die of illness halfway... After a year or half, the situation will be different from now."

"There is another problem." Wang Ding said, "What if that mountain bandit doesn't exist in this spacetime?" He looked at everyone, "This is very likely to happen."

Li Yan said: "Regardless of whether this mountain bandit exists or not, the Leizhou Prefect who takes office in 1632 must be fake anyway."

Wu Mingjin looked at the inner hall courtyard before him, and a wave of emotion surged in his heart.

In the inner hall courtyard, the vegetation remained the same under the autumn sun, only he was leaving here soon.

Two or three years ago, if he received a transfer order, he would probably have cried out for the blessing of gods and ancestors, hurriedly packed his luggage, and taken his family to ride away quickly. Like a bird escaping from a cage. In these few years, at the end of every year, when burning incense for the ancestral tablets, he prayed silently to leave this place of right and wrong, Lingao, as soon as possible—he didn't even want to be an official anymore, only praying to return to his hometown in South Zhili safely.

However, now, he didn't feel happy at all, but instead felt a bit more melancholy.

In these few years, he held a sinecure in Lingao. At first, there were some civil lawsuits to handle, but in the last year or so, he was simply completely forgotten. Except for Wang Zhaomin, auxiliary officials in the county like Wu Ya and Sun Ruiwu only came to visit him during festivals. Looking at their appearance, they probably mixed very well in the hands of the Australians. Everyone was red-faced and full of vigor. It was said that Wu Ya had brought his family to Lingao, showing a strong intention to settle down here.

Compared with them, Wu Mingjin was lonely. He was unwilling to work for the Australians, so apart from going to sit in the County Consultative Council every month to talk to local gentry; presiding over the monthly examination of the county school every month, and offering sacrifices on time, he had almost nothing to do—Private Secretary Wang was doing all the official documents of complying with orders. He spent most of his time sitting idly in the small world of this county yamen, either reading books and teaching his children, or amusing himself with poetry, wine, and tea, living a leisurely "immortal" life. Besides Private Secretary Wang, Senator Xiong also came to visit him every three to five days to play chess and drink wine with him. From time to time, he also presented some gifts and "allowances".

Earlier, Magistrate Wu's attitude towards Senator Xiong's visit contained vigilance and disdain. He knew that Xiong Buyou's actual position was the "Magistrate" of the Australians, and his "yamen" was right next to the county yamen. Needless to say, he also bore the mission of monitoring him. several times, Wu Mingjin was ready to be "poisoned to death"—especially when the imperial army was approaching.

Now his attitude had almost softened completely. Australians were mostly humorous and interesting people. Although their language was inevitably vulgar, in these few years they suppressed bandits, repaired water conservancy, relieved the people, encouraged industry and commerce, advised on agriculture and mulberry, and promoted education in Lingao... Lingao advanced by leaps and bounds, changing with each passing day, abruptly turning a poor and barren border county into the richest county town in Qiongzhou.

As long as he was willing, he could go out for a walk anytime, and could even go deep into the southern mountainous areas where he dared not go when he was the magistrate in the past. Lingao's changes were obvious to all. He, Wu Mingjin, was not blind or deaf, and was even less willing to speak against his conscience—Australians were authentic talents for saving the world and experts in governing the country. Himself, and even many other scholars, were far from comparable to them.

It was laughable to say. When he was the magistrate in Lingao, his performance assessment in the first year was only "medium-medium". Instead, after the Australians came, he achieved major political achievements several times in a row and got "Outstanding". Now that his term was full, he was promoted to General Judge of Leizhou—this official position was probably also obtained through the Australians' activities—Wu Mingjin was not a fool. He generally knew that Leizhou was also under the control of the Australians now. That he could get this job as Leizhou General Judge, and could leave without waiting for his successor to take over the seal, with Wu Ya temporarily acting as magistrate, was obviously the Australians' arrangement. As for the purpose, it was probably just out of the consideration that "acquaintances are easy to deal with". As long as he continued to "govern by doing nothing" in his term in Leizhou, and continued to have "Outstanding" performance assessments, it would probably not be a problem to be promoted after the term expired.

The butler trotted over to report: "Master, everything is ready. Please give instructions, shall we depart?"

"Has Private Secretary Wang got on the carriage?"

"Reporting to Master, he has boarded."

Wu Mingjin looked around the courtyard again: now he was leaving here—speaking of which, this county yamen was repaired by the Australians. Compared to the dilapidated yamen with grass deeper than knees and foxes and rats appearing when he took over, it was much more beautiful and tidy. In this courtyard, he and his family sat around to eat "Australian barbecue" in autumn and winter, ate shaved ice and sour plum soup in summer nights. He had also smoked cigars and drank Oolong tea here... All kinds of past events floated into his mind, and he suddenly became reluctant to part.

"Let's go." He finally said this word, immediately dusted off his robe, and strode out.

At the entrance of the county yamen, many people had already gathered. Apart from the auxiliary officials of the county, the rest were mostly gentry from the Consultative Council, students from the county school, and some commoners watching the excitement. The one sent by the Australians was Xiong Buyou, whom he was most familiar with. Senator Xiong was all smiles, bringing a band of musicians and several subordinates.

In front of the screen wall was a band, playing an Australian "decadent music" with blowing and beating. Wu Mingjin had heard people sing it as a ditty, seemingly called: "When Will the Gentleman Return".

Although it was decadent music, it was quite fitting for the occasion at this moment. Wu Mingjin cupped his hands and bowed to everyone on the steps of the county yamen gate. Seeing Jinshi Liu also among the seeing-off gentry, various emotions surged in his heart. His heart warmed, and the corners of his eyes turned slightly sour.

Xiong Buyou came up to shake hands and said a few complimentary words like "promotion is just around the corner". Then Liu Dalin was also supported up to propose a toast—since receiving treatment from the Lingao General Hospital, and with Liu San training a few servants and maids as physical therapists to persist in giving him medicine, acupuncture, massage, and various rehabilitation exercises every day, Jinshi Liu not only did not die early as in history but gradually could walk with a cane. Unless for long distances, he no longer needed a wheelchair.

Wu Mingjin took the wine cup—Liu Dalin was the "head" of the big gentry households in Lingao. Receiving a toast from him was a great honor for a prefecture or county official. This was much more imposing than some officials with bad reputations who could only hire a few people to fool the scene when leaving office.

After drinking the wine toasted by Master Liu, firecrackers exploded all at once. Two commoners came forward and took off one of his boots—this was the ceremony of taking off boots. Then someone presented a red lacquered wooden plaque painted with the two large characters "Virtuous Administration", and presented a Ten Thousand People Umbrella. This ceremony of seeing off the leaving official was declared "completed".

Here Director Xiong had already arranged several two-wheeled and four-wheeled carriages to transport family members and luggage. The family members had boarded. Wu Mingjin boarded the Red Flag carriage. At this time, the band played the folk music version of "Auld Lang Syne" in unison. The seeing-off crowd bowed together. At this time, he heard someone crying in the crowd. Magistrate Wu could no longer hold back, wiped his tears with his sleeve, bowed repeatedly, and then drilled into the carriage. Accompanied by the band, the convoy started slowly and went out of the city along the street in front of the county office.

Wu Mingjin's new post was across the strait from Lingao, but he had to go to the provincial capital as usual before taking office. Before Wu Mingjin boarded the liner to Guangzhou, the machinery of the Foreign Intelligence Bureau began to operate.

It was not difficult at all for the Guangzhou Station to maneuver Wu Mingjin to become the General Judge of Leizhou—his performance assessment and term of office were both suitable. Leizhou was a remote and evil prefecture where few people were willing to go. Although the income was good, foreign officials often refused to acclimatize or died of epidemics, so officials often regarded it as a dangerous road. What the Intelligence Bureau cared about was how to continue to effectively control General Judge Wu in the new environment.

Private Secretary Wang had already been "developed", but this crafty old secretary who was only interested in profit could not guarantee complete reliability. Therefore, Li Yan decided to form a team of loyal and reliable naturalized staff around Wu Mingjin and others to ensure that they were completely in the hands of the Foreign Intelligence Bureau.

The martial team was easy to deal with; they had a large room for selection; but the civil team was slightly lacking—originally they couldn't gather many scholars, and those confirmed reliable were even fewer. Li Yan considered again and again and decided to send Xiao Zhanfeng, the former Xiucai of Xuwen County, to Wu Mingjin's side to serve as a "supervising army" in the capacity of a clerical secretary.
