# Chapter 2010 - The List

Mao Xiuyu's reasoning was sound and sensible. Both Lu Cheng and Lu Weijia nodded repeatedly.

Usually they rather looked down on Mao Xiuyu, feeling that if he weren't "familiar with local conditions" and somewhat useful, he'd be nothing but dead weight.

Who'd have thought he could think things through so thoroughly? Though usually silent, just making up numbers at meetings, when it mattered he could speak with such logic. The two looked at him with new respect.

This was exactly the effect Mao Xiuyu wanted. He thought to himself: I've been working here for over twenty years. Without some skills, how could I have lasted so long?

After this discussion, the three had clarified their thinking. Disabled naturalized citizens would be matched with single women, while students would be assigned to physically healthy ordinary naturalized citizens who urgently needed wives.

With their thinking aligned, they immediately worked with their subordinates to review everyone's files. Single women in one group, students in another, screening out those who didn't meet the requirements.

Everyone at the shelter had been registered on personnel cards. Though they couldn't use the mechanical computers, the card index system had been introduced. Lu Cheng had been trained in this area. First using elimination: those with "attitude problems," "problematic history," "diseases"... and so on were excluded. Then the remainder underwent manual screening.

After much selecting, erasing, and revising, two lists were completed.

Then they discovered another problem: some widows had children with them. They hoped to marry, but even more hoped their new husbands would accept their children. Whether naturalized citizens would be willing to accept such "baggage" was another question... As this concerned marital harmony, they hesitated again.

"I think there are probably even more problems. If marrying a disabled naturalized citizen, their concerns would definitely be greater. Because besides children, there's also a man to care for. The family burden is heavier. And whether the husband would object to having an extra mouth to feed—that's probably also an issue..."

"We should still follow the principle of voluntariness. I think we should first talk to these single women and see what they're worried about and what concerns them. What we can resolve, we'll do our best. What's beyond our scope, we'll refer to the Elder." Lu Cheng said at the impromptu meeting. Based on years of experience working with Elders, if one problem was discovered, it meant there were at least two or three more lurking underneath. The other two agreed.

The three first had their subordinates work on the single women, then gathered the promising "students" together for discussions, asking about their thoughts.

That very afternoon, all eligible single women were assembled. They weren't stupid. Ever since that Elder's inspection visit, the staff here had been bustling about. It definitely had to do with them. What the future would look like, they didn't know.

When everyone was present, Lu Weijia explained the reason for gathering them, including matchmaking with disabled naturalized citizens.

"...That's the basic situation. Of course, we adhere to the principle of voluntariness. Those willing to marry and start new lives, the Council of Elders will do its best to arrange your lives and work. Those willing to marry disabled naturalized workers will also receive appropriate subsidies from the Council. Those who don't want to marry can stay here and wait for the Council to arrange work later."

Hearing this left them both happy and worried. Happy that the Elders were indeed considering their futures—life ahead might not be worry-free, but at least it would be better than now. Worried that their future husbands would be disabled—inconvenience of movement wasn't a problem to attend to, but poor health meant limited earning ability. Would family expenses be enough? Those with children worried about what would happen to them—would new husbands be willing to become stepfathers? Those without children worried about whether, if they got pregnant after marriage, they could manage the household. Others feared that if they married and the husband's disability meant he "couldn't perform"—what then? Without offspring, what would happen in old age?

Seeing the expressions on the faces below, Lu Weijia knew they'd been right—everyone indeed had many questions. Putting himself in their shoes, if he were one of these widows, he'd have to think carefully too! Years of bitter water behind them, and finally some hope—they couldn't just jump into another sea of suffering.

"Whatever concerns you have, speak your minds. We'll give you clear answers where we know the policies. What we're not sure about, we'll compile and ask the Elder. Either way, we'll give everyone a clear reply."

With these words, the atmosphere below immediately became lively. Lu Cheng instructed staff to divide them into groups, with one person per group, individually recording their various questions and concerns. Lu Cheng herself joined a group.

At the small group sessions, people opened up much more than at large meetings. The single women had many questions: housing, work, monthly income, in-laws. Being widows, would they be looked down upon? Was the man's temper good or bad—"They say disabled people have especially bad tempers. Would they beat their wives often?" Those with children asked what would happen to them, whether the husband's family would be willing to raise them...

Lu Cheng's expression showed difficulty, because they really couldn't answer all these questions: Elder Du hadn't been that specific. Besides, many questions varied from person to person—nobody could guarantee anything.

The three were glad they'd asked first. Otherwise, if things fell flat due to excessive concerns when the time came, they'd anger the Elder. Getting scolded aside, it would also be embarrassing.

"Don't worry about being looked down on or beaten. The Council of Elders protects women's basic rights. Don't we have the Women's Federation to back you up? Besides, these marriages are arranged by the Council—everyone's a Council person. No matter how bad his temper, he'd have to show some respect, right?" Lu Cheng thought for a moment and decided to first say things that were both reassuring and absolutely correct. "As for work, there'll naturally be arrangements, definitely better than now—proper naturalized citizen workers. Once married, your children would also enjoy workers' dependent benefits—they can go to school with reduced fees. Other questions, we'll ask the Elder and give you a reply."

To strengthen her persuasion and add some pressure, Lu Cheng continued: "We'll definitely try to give clear answers to your concerns. We'll ask the Elder to help solve practical difficulties as best we can. But you should also treasure this opportunity. Some of you sisters aren't young anymore. Miss this chance, and there won't be another. Right now the population under the Council isn't large, but after the Two Guangs are fully liberated, there'll be several million people under the Council's rule. Then conditions probably won't be this good."

The next day, they specially gathered suitable candidates from among the students and announced this matter.

Actually, most students were willing to marry and return to normal life. But their health conditions were far worse than the "single women." The single women mostly had nutritional issues—after a few months of recuperation, most had recovered quite well. The students were much worse off.

Looking just at nutrition, prostitutes' daily diets were much better than the widows'. But lower-tier prostitutes had been ravaged for so long that many had venereal diseases and gynecological problems were widespread.

Those with severe gynecological problems, regardless of whether they could conceive, couldn't even manage normal married life. So these had to be excluded first. What troubled the management team was another group: those whose health was passable, but who had lost their fertility due to long-term use of contraceptive "cooling medicines" or multiple abortions.

If infertile students were excluded, it would obviously be unfair to them. But including them—how would the male naturalized citizens feel? And if infertility was discovered later, what problems might arise...

Ultimately, Lu Cheng set the tone: as long as conditions were suitable, they'd be placed on the candidate list, but clearly noted. This way it was mutual consent, with no one to blame.

With this approach, the students actually placed on the list numbered fewer than a hundred. Unlike the widows' mixed reactions, the students responded much more eagerly. They were far more anxious about their survival prospects and had no children to complicate things. If they married naturalized citizens, at least they wouldn't have to suffer here anymore—everyone knew what being a naturalized citizen meant.

"The Elder said only those of you who've performed well and studied diligently are qualified to become naturalized citizens' wives. After marriage, you'll be assigned work and leave here for better lives," Lu Cheng said. "These past months, the Council of Elders has been watching your performance. You were bullied and suffered in the old society, but you also picked up many bad habits—some haven't completely changed." Her gaze swept across the crowd. "So remember: change your thinking quickly. Both in thought and action, you must measure up to qualified naturalized citizens! Wait for further notice about the specifics."

Within half an hour after dismissal, news spread among the students. Those not on the candidate list looked at the chosen ones with envy and jealousy. The sharp-tongued ones couldn't help making snide comments about "social climbing." Some were so upset they spread rumors that the chosen ones were being selected to become "official prostitutes, military prostitutes, to be sent to Australian government offices and military camps to service clients." Naturally, these rumor-mongers received beatings and dark room treatment that very night.

But for most, being selected was obviously a great benefit. Back when they were prostitutes, their greatest wish was for some patron to be willing to pay to redeem them and let them start fresh, living with dignity. Now that opportunity was right before their eyes, yet they'd missed it. Many were quite regretful—if only they'd been a bit more proactive before, they too could have become activists and left this place as proper naturalized citizens.

Still others, based on years of experience being deceived, maintained a cold attitude toward this matter: "Reform? Let's talk when it actually happens."
