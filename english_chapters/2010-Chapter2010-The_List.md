# Chapter 2010 - The List

Mao Xiuyu's speech could be said entering feeling entering reason. Lu Cheng and Lu Weijia both nodded non-stop.

Usually they were quite despising towards Mao Xiuyu. Feeling if not for he "Familiar with Local Situation." More or less still useful. Simply a decoration.

Couldn't see he considered quite detailed. Although usually not making sound meeting just making up number. But critical moment speaking head head path path [logical]. Making two people scrape eyes look.

Mao Xiuyu wanted just such effect. He secretly thought: Father mixed here for twenty plus years. Without some ability how can mix so long?

After such a conversation. Thoughts of three people cleared. Disabled naturalized citizens find from Single Women. Then allocate Student to ordinary naturalized citizens with healthy body urgent needing marrying wife.

Three people thought consistent. Immediately checked everyone material with subordinate together. Single Woman one group. Student one group. Then screen out unsuitable people from inside.

All personnel in Shelter made Population Card. But Mechanical Computer still didn't turn to them use. But Card Index System was introduced. Lu Cheng received training in this aspect. Used Exclusion Method first. Excluding "Attitude Problematic" "History Stained" "Disease"... such unsuitable people out. Then engage artificial screening to remaining.

Picking coming choosing going. Scribbling smearing half day. Made ready two lists.

This time they found another problem: Some widows carrying child. They both hope marrying. More hope own new husband can accept their child. But having such a "Drag Oil Bottle." Whether naturalized citizen willing to accept is another problem... Matter concerning husband wife family harmony problem. They hesitated again.

"I think inside may have more problems. If marrying disabled naturalized citizen. Their scruple definitely more. Because besides child. Still have man to take care. Family burden heavier. Also whether male side because family added a mouth licking having opinion. Fear also a problem..."

"Still need to follow Voluntary Principle. I see we can find these Single Women talking first. Seeing they worry what scruple what. Can solve we try solve. Exceeding our duty range hand to Chief." Lu Cheng said in temporary meeting. According to experience with Chief for many years. Discovery of one problem. That meant at least two three potential problems not found. Remaining two expressed no problem.

Three people took subordinate doing those Single Women work first. Then concentrated those behaving good inside "Students" talking. Asking their thoughts.

That was same day afternoon. All conforming Single Women were concentrated up. They not stupid either. Since that Chief inspection left. Staff here started busy. Definitely related to self. What future look like. They didn't know either.

Seeing people gathered complete. Lu Weijia roughly explained reason convening them coming. Including Blind Date for disabled naturalized citizen.

"...This is basic situation. Of course we still uphold Voluntary Principle. You willing to marry starting new life. Senate will try best help you arrange life and work well. If willing to marry disabled naturalized citizen staff. Senate will also issue appropriate subsidy; If not want marrying. Can also stay here. Waiting Senate arranging work for you later."

After listening this let them both happy and worry. Happy was Chief indeed considered outlet for them. Future life not saying worry-free. At least much better than now. Worry was future husband is disabled personnel. Action inconvenient self serving wasn't problem. But body not good definitely cannot earn more money. Family expense whether enough use? Having child worried child how to do. New husband willing or not be Stepfather first. Without child worried self work pregnancy later. How to take care of this family. Also some afraid if marrying over husband disabled "Cannot Human Way" then how? No heir. How to do when old?

Seeing expression of a group below. Lu Weijia knew they thought not wrong. Everyone indeed had many problems. Compariing heart to heart. Changing self be widows below. Also couldn't help thinking more! How many years bitter water scoured over. Not easy having some hope. Cannot jumping into bitter sea to suffer again.

"Everyone has what scruple. Speak open. We know policy. Try giving a clear answer—We also not clear. After summarizing ask Chief instruction. Anyway will give everyone a clear clear answer."

Having this sentence. Atmosphere below instantly hot up. Lu Cheng concerned staff dividing them into groups. Every person one small group. Recording their various problems and scruples one by one. Lu Cheng self also participated one small group.

Speaking in small meeting was much open than big meeting. Single Women problems many. From housing. Work to monthly income. Also parent-in-law problem. Because widow background. Will be disliked by opponent or not; Man temper good or bad—"Heard people having disability temper especially big. Will often beaten or not"; With child inquiring child how. Husband family willing or not raise...

Lu Cheng listened face showing difficulty color. Because these problems they truly couldn't answer one by one: Chief Du didn't speak so fine. Besides many problem inside were varying person by person. Who couldn't say hitting guarantee either.

Three people rejoiced self asked once first. Otherwise when time comes cold field because scruple many. Annoying Chief. Self scolded not saying. Also very losing face.

"Disliked or beaten need not fear. Senate protects women basic rights. Don't we still have Women Federation making decision for everyone! Besides this marriage is Senate making decision. Everyone is Senate person. Temper he bad again. Also need politeness three points!" Lu Cheng thought. Decided saying some comforting people heart and Hundred Percent not wrong words first. "As for work naturally will have arrangement. Definitely better than now—Serious Naturalized Staff. Married your children also enjoy Staff Children treatment—Can enter school schooling. Fee has reduction. Remaining problems we will ask Chief instruction. Will give you a reply."

For enhancing self persuasion power. Adding some pressure to them. Lu Cheng said again: "Everyone scruple. We definitely will try giving a clear explanation. Some practical difficulties. Also will ask Chief helping solve try. But everyone also need cherishing this opportunity. Some sisters age not small. Passed this village. Future no that shop. Currently Senate rule population not many. But waiting Two Kwang recovered. Senate rule population has several millions. Fear no such good condition."

Next day they concentrated suitable candidates in Student specially again. Announced this matter.

Inside Student actually most people still willing to marry. Returning normal life. But health degree they far inferior to "Single Women." Single Women mostly nutritional problem. After several months nursing mostly recovered not bad. Student side much worse.

Sole looking from nutrition status. Prostitute daily diet much better than Chaste Women. But Middle Lower Class Prostitute suffered destruction long term. Not only many people had Venereal Disease. And universally had Gynecological Disease.

Gynecological Disease serious. Let alone whether can pregnant giving birth. Even normal husband wife life also hard to do. So this part can only eliminate first. Making Management Group difficult was another part. Their health problem acceptable. But because long term taking contraceptive "Cool Medicine" or multiple abortion. Actually already lost fertility.

If excluding students losing fertility out. To them obviously unfair. But putting in. Male naturalized citizen side how to consider. When finding cannot fertility will make what problem again...

Finally still Lu Cheng set tone: As long as condition suitable. Still put them into Candidate List. But need remarking clear. Such counted both side voluntary. Who relying no who.

Doing so. Actually students listed into name list less than one hundred. Different from half happy half worry of widows. Reaction of students much enthusiastic. They more anxious to future survival problem. Also no drag of children. If married naturalized citizen. Self finally need not eating bitter suffering tired here—Who didn't know what Naturalized Citizen meant.

"Chief said. Only you these behaving good. Study active have qualification becoming Naturalized Citizen wife. After marriage will arrange work for you. Leaving here living better days." Lu Cheng said. "Wait these months your behavior Senate all looking in eyes. You bullied in Old Society. Suffered bitterness. But also infected quite a few bad habits of past—Some people haven't completely changed." Her gaze swept in crowd. "So you must remember. Must transform thought ASAP. Regardless on thought or action must align to a qualified Naturalized Citizen! Specific situation you wait notification."

Less than half hour after dismissing this news spread inside these Students. Those not listed into Candidate List every one looked at them with Envy Jealousy Hate. Tooth sharp mouth profit inevitably spoke some "Climbing High Branch" cool words. Still some people heart angry. Then said those selected all going to "Be Official Prostitute, Camp Prostitute. Sent to Australian various Yamen and Camp receiving guest." Naturally those rumor mongers that night enjoyed Butt Blossom plus Small Black Room treatment.

But to most people. Being selected naturally huge benefit. When being prostitute initially. Most wanted nothing more than which benefactor willing to pay money redeeming self out to Follow Good. Doing person cleanly. Now this opportunity just before eyes. Self missed instead. Many people quite regretful—If self active some initially. Could be an Activist too. Isn't it can leave here becoming a Dignified Naturalized Citizen like this?

Still some people. Upholding their experience cheated by people life long. To this matter still cold attitude: "Follow Good? Wait till Following Good saying again."
