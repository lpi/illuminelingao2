# Chapter 602 - Becoming Ming

To enhance their practical experience, they specially organized tours of the county yamen—apart from the inner chambers, they visited everything. Wherever they went, yamen runners provided specialized explanations.

Wang Zhaomin, the Advisor, was also occasionally invited for "discussion sessions." Unlike the yamen runners and clerks undergoing "reform," his level was higher and his status more delicate. To prevent him from growing suspicious at facing a large crowd and refusing to speak freely, the usual practice was for Xiong Buyu to lure him to the Liaison Office under the pretense of "drinking tea and wine."

A small courtyard had been arranged at the County Liaison Office. With some tidying and repair, and a few trees and plants, the environment was quite elegant. It was specifically used for meeting with county officials. The atmosphere here was relaxed and the environment quiet, making conversation quite convenient. The Liaison Office occasionally held tea tastings and garden parties here to foster good relations.

Advisor Wang's "lectures" took place here. However, he didn't know he had this "honor." While he and Xiong Buyu chatted expansively, the surroundings were actually filled with people—the place had been specially modified. Although it appeared no one was around, the trainees were all seated in hidden chambers listening to their conversation.

Advisor Wang very much enjoyed coming to the Liaison Office to relax and chat. Originally, sitting idly in the county yamen was rather boring—Lingao had always been a place with "slow business." As the Australians continued to intervene in county affairs, he had little to do besides routinely transcribing official documents and handling the county's bureaucratic paperwork. Moreover, the Australians' simplified courts had taken away a large portion of the advisor's main business of "criminal cases."

Now that someone was inviting him to chat over drinks, Wang Zhaomin naturally accepted every invitation, drank at every visit, and then expounded at length. As a result, Xiong Buyu had to prepare topics for each conversation in advance, lest Wang's enthusiasm carry him endlessly off course.

Yet the content of his casual conversation was quite valuable to the transmigrators. As an advisor, his observations and understanding of officialdom were deeper and more comprehensive than those of the clerks and runners. Moreover, advisors traveled extensively on official circuits, were knowledgeable and worldly, with perspectives far broader than the yamen runners and clerks of a small county town. And he had contact with society's upper, middle, and lower strata. Li Yan's request for Wang to hold "discussion sessions" at the Liaison Office was largely intended to broaden the horizons of the field operatives and deepen their understanding of Ming Dynasty social conditions.

Wang Zhaomin's discussion sessions were all recorded—to be reviewed afterward and compiled into reference materials—but no real-time interpretation was provided. He spoke in mandarin, and Li Yan required everyone to go back and summarize what he'd said into reports. This primarily tested the field operatives' mastery of mandarin; secondly, it trained their ability to "reconstruct" intelligence content.

Another major indigenous instructor for the "Ming Dynasty Social Conditions Lecture Series" was Police Headquarters Consultant Zhou Shizhai. He taught all manner of Ming Dynasty social stratagems, trade secrets, and the various rules and risks of traveling abroad.

Travel in ancient society was both arduous and dangerous. Whether rich or poor, one faced tremendous risks during travel. Zhou Shizhai had escorted caravans and guarded estates; his social experience was extraordinarily rich.

"...When traveling far from home, remember: scald your feet every day but don't wash your face." He passed on his experiences to everyone. "Whenever conditions permit, scald your feet to drain blisters and soothe your muscles and tendons, but don't bother washing your face."

Not washing one's face was to prevent the facial skin from cracking. The roads were dusty and the sun fierce, making sunburn and chapping common. Ancient people had no sunscreen, so they used dust as a protective cover.

As for dangers on the road, there were too many to count. Zhou Shizhai focused on how to avoid staying at "black inns," which places were prime locations for bandits to ambush, how to arrange sleeping at night to avoid being robbed...

"...Once you're on the road, never let your money show." Zhou Shizhai advised earnestly. "There are far too many people along the way who'll conceive evil intentions at the sight of wealth. Beyond brigands, among the cart-drivers, boat-ferrymen, innkeepers, and porters, there are many bandits biding their time." He then recounted how once, while escorting a cargo, he was crossing a river when the boatmen, seeing the quantity of cargo, suddenly decided to commit robbery. The escort agency only barely managed to escape with the cargo intact.

Much of the knowledge and tricks Zhou Shizhai imparted had been accumulated by the escort agency during years of convoy work. It was extremely practical for intelligence operatives going into the field. Not only did the Intelligence Bureau invite him to lecture, but the Police Headquarters also specially collected and compiled his teachings as reference materials.

Liu Gang, who had long been selling illicit salt for the Colonial and Trade Department, was also invited. He'd made his fortune running contraband salt for the transmigrator collective. This time he was secretly brought in to lecture on Ming Dynasty commerce and illegal trade, especially on how a small or medium-sized merchant could conduct business in Ming Dynasty society.

As for He Xin, whom Lin Baiguang had rescued, he was specially recalled from Qiongshan to give a lecture series on Ming Dynasty brothels. This lecture also covered many forms of entertainment and leisure in the Ming Dynasty. They learned the rules, jargon, scams, consumption standards, and taboos of high-class establishments.

When He Xin heard he had to return to Lingao, he was terrified, thinking he'd fallen back into the clutches of the demon Fu Youdi. To his surprise, after returning, he was teaching a strange group of people how to visit brothels, attend drinking parties with courtesans, play dice games...

All kinds of indigenous workers under the transmigrators' control, as long as it was thought their knowledge and experience might be useful, would be "invited" into a palanquin at night and quietly carried into the training center. There, they would sit face-to-face with several chiefs, speaking through a tightly sealed curtain, and teach everything the chiefs wished to know. No one knew what was behind the curtain, but clever people could probably guess that Australian chiefs were also seated there, because whenever someone's accent was too strong, a chief would repeat what they'd said in Australian mandarin.

To enhance the field operatives' sense of immersion, Yu Eshui organized practical life-scenario drills, with indigenous personnel playing different roles. Each time he designated a life scenario and assigned a field operative to play one role, while indigenous people played one or several others. When an operative checked into an inn, the indigenous people were the innkeeper and attendants; when buying a maidservant, they were the broker; when negotiating business, they were business partners; when visiting government offices, they were the gatekeepers, yamen runners, advisors, and county magistrates...

Each performance used indigenous people who, as much as possible, had actual experience in such occupations, to ensure maximum accuracy. To encourage the indigenous people to be tough on the field operatives, Yu Eshui scored each performance. The indigenous person who performed best in challenging the field operative could earn extra rewards.

After each performance, everyone gathered for a replay-style analysis. Yu Eshui specifically required field operatives to remember the jargon and secret codes used by various characters, and to understand their counterparts' thought patterns and methods of handling affairs.

"Don't harbor a sense of 'I am Superman.' Don't think you can never lose out." Yu Eshui mercilessly hammered this into them during class. "You were ordinary citizens in the 21st century, and you won't become important figures in the 17th century either. Without the transmigrator collective as a whole, you are nothing. Unless it's necessary and approved by headquarters—don't try to showcase your uniqueness anywhere, your vast knowledge, your distinction from the crowd. Certainly don't go around preaching 'democracy' or 'one nation, one party, one leader' and such things. You're not being sent to the Ming Dynasty to become scientists, politicians, or any other kind of '-ists.' Your mission is simply to 'seem like a Ming Dynasty commoner.' That's all."

To ensure they truly "seemed" genuine, their sense of immersion had to be enhanced. At various stages, field operatives would go out on internships in the guise of Ming persons. The internship content started simple—buying things, hiring servants—then gradually progressed to trying to run a small business on their own... Everyone had to ensure others couldn't recognize their true identity.

Personnel from the Political Security General Administration's Operations Division would follow and monitor the field operatives to see if any indigenous people detected them. Li Yan believed that since indigenous people in Lingao were those who interacted most with transmigrators, if they could fool them, there would be no problem on the mainland.

Later, these operations evolved into adversarial exercises. Both sides limited the venue and number of participants, then Intelligence Bureau trainees and Political Security Bureau trainees tried to identify and apprehend each other within that space.

Once they were generally deemed problem-free and convincingly disguised, the deployed transmigrators would be secretly escorted by the Special Reconnaissance Team on several long-distance overland journeys. The destination was typically Qiongshan County. The deployed transmigrators, just like all indigenous travelers, would carry simple luggage and minimal funds, traveling on foot or by sedan chair. These journeys would give them a firsthand feel for the environment they'd be operating in—Lingao had already been transformed into near-modern conditions, quite different from the actual 17th-century time-space.

In Qiongshan County, under the covert protection of the Qiongzhou Station, they could move about for several days to half a month, experiencing the social conditions under Ming Dynasty rule. This leg of the journey was considered a passing grade. Afterward, field operatives would have the opportunity to visit Guangzhou to witness what a major city of this time-space looked like.

Beyond disguise courses, the transmigrators also had to learn all knowledge that might be needed for intelligence work. They learned surveillance and counter-surveillance, combat techniques and the skills of using daggers, basic surveying and map-making, and how to accurately judge numbers, object dimensions, and distances using only visual estimation. They learned to use radios, encryption and decryption—until there were reliable indigenous radio operators, all this had to be done by the transmigrators themselves. Radios were precious and limited in quantity, so most of the time they needed to use encrypted letters. The Intelligence Bureau had developed an invisible ink method: essentially using rice water to write, revealed by iodine. Since no one in the Ming Dynasty besides the transmigrators had iodine, security shouldn't be an issue.

They also mastered a simple set of specialized code words: "Center" meant the Intelligence Bureau headquarters; "swimming" meant travel; "sick" meant arrested; "doing wet work" meant assassination; "legend" meant a fabricated cover identity and history; "wine" referred to invisible ink; "pipa" meant a radio; "neighbor" meant the Political Security General Administration; "peddler" meant a courier...

Finally, they were sent to the wilderness exploration team, where Liu Zheng and others guided them through a four-week wilderness survival course, ensuring they could use these skills if they ever needed to escape.

While Division B of the Intelligence Training Center was in full swing with intensive training, Division A was also rapidly training indigenous intelligence personnel. Their curriculum was more extensive and compressed than the transmigrators', but focused on intelligence operations. This batch of personnel would be dispatched as aides to the transmigrators. All of these aides were men—it wasn't convenient to bring women on the road before settling down.

One day, Li Yan gathered everyone together to announce some news:

"Pack your things. We're going to Fangcaodi now."

Only after arriving at Fangcaodi did they learn that this was for them to select their "domestic secretaries." Li Yan announced: The selected domestic secretaries would receive additional intelligence training at Division A, and once each person was settled in their work location, they would gradually be sent to join their side to assist in intelligence work.

"The leadership is really looking out for us." Someone was moved to tears of gratitude.

Others weren't so appreciative: "Didn't you say we could freely buy women ourselves? Why do we need to bring domestic secretaries?"

"Domestic secretaries are safer than women you buy outside, aren't they?" Li Yan said. "And they can help you with intelligence work too—two birds with one stone. What's not to like?"

When he put it that way, everyone was satisfied. Each person then looked at the files and selected the girl they wanted. Most people spent the amount of their female servant subsidy to buy a C-grade maidservant. Some who had their eyes on higher-grade ones could only register and await subsequent lottery results. The maidservants wouldn't arrive for a while anyway—according to "Center's" plan, they wouldn't be dispatched until at least three months after they'd settled in locally.

Near the Cooperative General Store in East Gate Market, there was a very large building. This building was one of the few traditional-style structures in the market. It had a large front courtyard for parking vehicles and palanquins, with warehouses on both sides for storing goods.

The main building was the shop, its wooden counter polished to a mirror sheen with varnish and tung oil. The goods were numerous and varied, but unlike the cooperative, this place sold products from the mainland: cloth from Songjiang, silk and candied fruits from Suzhou and Hangzhou, porcelain from Jiangxi, tea and oranges from Fujian... all manner of northern and southern goods. Having such a well-stocked large shop in Lingao would have been unimaginable if the population hadn't multiplied several times in recent years and people hadn't come into a bit of money.

The second courtyard contained a grand main hall. Square bricks covered the floor, with fine Guangdong rosewood side tables and official's hat chairs. Large porcelain vases and a carved wood screen stood in the center of the hall. Eight lanterns with the characters "Quanfu" hung under the eaves—strictly speaking, this exceeded what was proper. But in the southern reaches, the emperor was far away, and no one would bother about it. In Lingao, there was even less need for caution.

Such grand style—clearly a prosperous traditional commercial establishment of long standing. Everyone knew this establishment was Lingao's number one "imperial merchant," the property of Lin Quan'an, the designated supplier to the Australians.

This Lin Quan'an, three years ago—to everyone who knew him, and including himself—could never have dreamed that one day people would call him "Master Lin," let alone that he could have accumulated such wealth and influence.

He sat in the counting room behind the main hall, surrounded by commercial documents and large account books. Master Lin was about thirty-five or thirty-six years old, yet his skin was already dark and full of wrinkles, making him look like someone in his early fifties. He was a man of humble origins. For nearly twenty years of his life, he had passed his days peddling goods from village to village with a carrying pole, living hand to mouth.

But now he wore a gown of Nanjing fragrant cloud silk from Guangdong, with a pair of straw slippers from Chenqiao in Kaifeng on his feet, studying the account books with rapt attention. Master Lin was a merchant who dared to be first in the world. In his early years he could neither read nor use an abacus, but later as his business grew—just as he'd been the first to do business with the "hair-shorn pirates" back in the day—he didn't hesitate to attend the literacy class run by the Australians. He learned to read, to use the abacus, and to keep accounts. These accounts were kept in Australian style, even using Australian numerals. This pleased him greatly—because this way, no one else could understand them.

A quill pen stood in an inkwell on the desk. Lin Quan'an couldn't write with a brush; he'd learned this method of dipping and writing from the Australians.

He was reviewing the pages of a large account book before him; each page was printed with horizontal and vertical lines, with liabilities recorded on the right and assets on the left. On the first page, in large characters, was written: "Third Year of Chongzhen, Year of the Metal Horse."

After Lin Quan'an finished reviewing the final item and carefully corrected an error, he leaned back in his chair wearily, feeling somewhat melancholy.

The retail business was doing well enough, with profits around thirty percent by rough estimate. But the volume of such sales was too low—he had grown accustomed to selling goods in large batches, and this piecemeal business no longer suited him.

These past two years, he'd grown accustomed to smooth sailing in big deals. Lin Quan'an recalled that three years ago, he'd been nothing but a peddler trudging through streets and alleys with goods on his shoulders. His capital was only four or five strings of cash. By walking village to village collecting vegetables, pigs, sheep, chickens, and ducks for the "hair-shorn pirates"—the Australian masters—he made a fortune within a year and opened this Quanfu Store. Then, under Master Xiong's direction, he gradually expanded his reach across the entire Qiongzhou Prefecture, procuring all sorts of goods for the Australian masters. He made money until his hands went numb—his residence and shop had doubled in size twice in three years. He now had glass windows, porcelain toilets, porcelain bathtubs, and running water just like the Australian masters used, not to mention thermos bottles, crystal mirrors, and other small items. Not only could he afford to marry a wife, he'd now taken two concubines.

All of this came from the Australians who arrived on iron ships. The Australians were his lucky stars and gods of wealth.

Recently, however, he felt this lucky star's light had dimmed somewhat. The accounts showed that his largest customer—the Australians—had been dealing with him less and less over the past six months. He'd only closed a few large transactions in timber, and though he'd sold quite a bit of northern and southern goods, the volumes weren't large.

Now the Australians were supplying their own vegetables, pigs, sheep, chickens, and ducks. They had so many vegetables that they couldn't eat them all and were making pickles to sell. As for pigs, sheep, chickens, and ducks, they'd recently been able to give their corps soldiers meat once a week. Australian ships continuously brought in whatever they needed from everywhere, naturally leaving less and less business for him.
