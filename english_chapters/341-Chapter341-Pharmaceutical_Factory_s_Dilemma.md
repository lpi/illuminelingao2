# Chapter 341 - Pharmaceutical Factory's Dilemma

Just thinking about the subtropical climate, jungles, and water network terrain, Shi Niaoren believed this ghostly place could harbor more than half of the world's pathogens. His mentor in the US would definitely have a special fondness for this place. A pity he didn't trick him into coming. That old American was as strong as an ox; he would have been a good laborer for the Ministry of Health. At least he could be made to examine poop.

Looking at the pile of stool sample jars in front of him, the grief and indignation in Shi Niaoren's heart were unimaginable to others—a dignified major professor was actually naturally dismissed here to deal with excrement.

Even worse, Shi Niaoren found that the infection rate began to rise. He detected eggs of more than ten kinds of parasites such as *Clonorchis sinensis* and *Taenia solium* in the asymptomatic population. Bacterial carriers might be even more, but due to the much greater complexity of bacterial examination, many could not be diagnosed yet. In a word, no one realized the complexity of modern medical examination.

And the ignorance and indifference of the ordinary transmigrator masses towards various parasites and infectious diseases gave him a headache even more. Eating wild fruits indiscriminately, hunting privately, and messing around with local women...

Reporting to the Executive Committee always got "mm-hmm, uh-huh" responses without concrete countermeasures; they didn't take it seriously at all!

Maybe a major epidemic outbreak would clear the heads of President Wen and Lord Superintendent Ma? Shi Niaoren put the petri dish under the microscope and looked carefully.

Fortunately, neither the curved bacillus of cholera nor other virulent infectious disease bacteria appeared in the sample. Instead, a large amount of Salmonella was detected. Comprehensively, this unlucky guy died of acute enteritis. Theoretically speaking, for general acute enteritis, as long as the patient didn't dehydrate or have electrolyte imbalance, recovery was possible with simple antidiarrheal drugs.

"If there were some antidiarrheal drugs in the quarantine camp, combined with some salt water, this person wouldn't have died." Shi Niaoren felt some regret; just belladonna tablets and a few bottles of physiological saline could have pulled him through.

Thinking about the weather getting gradually hotter and gastrointestinal diseases becoming frequent, cheap and easily available antidiarrheal drugs must be found immediately. Suddenly he thought of the opium in the Ministry of Health warehouse. It had been left in the warehouse since being bought from Macau. Although opium was a drug, it had strong effects on pain relief, cough suppression, and diarrhea control. It was actually a kind of universal medicine urgently needed now.

Shi Niaoren disposed of the specimen, washed his hands again, lit a cigarette, and called Wu De, telling him that the yellow disease warning for the quarantine camp could be lifted. Then he called Wu Nanhai again, asking him to pay attention to hygiene issues in the cafeteria and food processing factory.

"...Tomorrow," Shi Niaoren checked his schedule, "I'll come to inspect personally, and help you work out a notice for summer hygiene by the way."

"Great, welcome, welcome." Wu Nanhai's voice sounded a bit nervous on the phone.

"Don't be nervous; I'm not the Health Bureau coming down to fine you." Shi Niaoren said, "Don't do a surprise cleaning; let me see the real situation so I can prescribe the right medicine. If you whitewash it like painting powder on a donkey dung ball, problems won't be seen, and big trouble will happen later."

After arranging the hygiene check with Wu Nanhai, Shi Niaoren wanted to call the Pharmaceutical Factory again, but on second thought, it was better to go personally and relax by the way—he had been smelling poop since waking up at 5 am, and it was almost noon. Going to the Pharmaceutical Factory, he could also mooch a meal at the farm.

The Pharmaceutical and Medical Equipment Factory was located inside the farm. It was a composite reinforced concrete frame building. A chimney was spewing smoke into the air. It was equipped with a dedicated boiler room, geothermal air conditioning, self-supplied purified water source, and a dedicated waste incinerator. The overall infrastructure could be rated as first-class. However, this was Shi Niaoren's first visit here since the factory was completed and put into production—after all, this wasn't his major.

The Pharmaceutical and Medical Equipment Factory belonged to a Level 1 unit with strict access control. The iron-clad gate of the yard was tightly closed. He rang the doorbell for a long time before a face appeared in the small window on the door—startling Shi Niaoren; it was a face with burn scars.

Then he remembered; this was a disabled soldier. These people basically served as guards in vital departments now.

"Dean!" As soon as the guard saw it was the Dean of the Hospital and concurrent Factory Director, he hurriedly opened the door.

Although Shi Niaoren had an impression of treating this person, he couldn't remember his name, so he just nodded politely: "Is Zhao Yanmei in?"

"In, in," the guard responded repeatedly, "You sit in the office first; I'll go notify—"

"No need. Where is she? I'll find her myself."

"Director Zhao said," the guard thought for a moment, "No one else can enter when she is working. Better let me notify."

Room numbers starting with 0 meant the basement. Probably the strain laboratory. Although Shi Niaoren didn't do biochemistry, he knew a bit about the principles—presumably, she was doing things like strain cultivation and didn't want people entering and exiting to bring in miscellaneous bacteria.

"How do you notify?" Shi Niaoren got curious. Although there was a telephone here, internal telephones didn't exist.

"Use this." The guard led him into the guard room with a limp. Inside, shelves were built along the wall, divided into several rows, with small nameplates nailed on them. Above the nameplate was a small bell and a pull cord.

The guard seriously wrote down the date and the visitor's name in crooked handwriting in the register, then pulled the rope under a certain nameplate a few times. After a moment, the small bell on the nameplate also rang.

"Director Zhao knows. She'll come out immediately."

"? This system is not bad." Shi Niaoren thought this was similar to the electric bells in hospital inpatient departments. Although they couldn't communicate, at least they could convey simple information. Thinking this system could also be used in the hospital. He would ask Zhao Yanmei about it later.

Zhao Yanmei's office was separate. Shi Niaoren sat for quite a while before seeing her return.

It turned out Zhao Yanmei was inoculating Kasugamycin in the strain laboratory. This antibiotic was mainly used in agriculture to prevent crop diseases and had little medical value—used for treating mild infections not serious in degree. Shi Niaoren was inevitably somewhat dissatisfied—in his view, joint ventures with the Agricultural Committee would have such results, satisfying their needs first.

Seeing the leader's face wasn't very cheerful, Zhao Yanmei guessed his thoughts.

"This is also for practice!" She explained, "The indigenous cultivation of Kasugamycin is relatively simple and doesn't have high requirements for environmental conditions. If we can make this work, cultivating other strains later will be easier."

Shi Niaoren hurriedly asked: "What strains are prepared to be cultivated next? Can Penicillin work?"

"Cultivating Penicillin isn't difficult; purification is the troublesome part." Zhao Yanmei frowned, "Wait until conditions are better. For medical use, we can cultivate Oxytetracycline first. This is relatively simpler."

Having Oxytetracycline to use was not bad either; this thing's effect was almost the same as Tetracycline, a quite broad-spectrum antibiotic.

"Having Oxytetracycline is good too." Shi Niaoren's face looked much better.

Zhao Yanmei's next sentence made Shi Niaoren extremely unhappy again: "It's also good for fattening pigs."

"Fattening pigs?"

"Yes, Old Yang said so." Old Yang was naturally Yang Baogui.

"I'm afraid there won't be enough medicine for humans when the time comes. We act miserably short of antibiotics now!" Shi Niaoren made a heartbroken gesture.

"Being anxious won't work either." Zhao Yanmei said, "Antibiotics produced haven't undergone animal testing. With our conditions, the antibiotics produced won't have few impurities. I'm afraid accidents will happen if humans eat them..."

"Can't care about so much now." Shi Niaoren said, "Solve the problem of existence first."

Zhao Yanmei came from a formal pharmaceutical factory and still wasn't quite adapted to such a crude, indigenous method tone. For a time, she was silent.

"Not that urgent, right?" Zhao Yanmei said, "The Acid and Alkali Plant is about to start production soon. After that, the Coal Chemical Combined Plant will also start production. It'll be fine once production starts."

"I saw it in the newspaper." Shi Niaoren wasn't interested in coal chemical enterprises, "Coal chemical products are many, probably synthetic ammonia? But those are for industrial use. Could they produce antibiotics?"

"Sulfonamide!" Zhao Yanmei said, "Ji Situi said, once this Coal Chemical Combined Plant starts production, one of the byproducts is sulfonamide raw material."

Shi Niaoren certainly knew what sulfonamide meant. This chemical synthetic was first found in dyes and was the most effective anti-infective drug before penicillin-type antibiotics. In this space-time where bacteria hadn't developed drug resistance yet, this thing alone could save countless lives!

"Really?!" Shi Niaoren was surprised and delighted, almost standing up. This was major good news.

"Ji Situi said it. He's an expert; he wouldn't talk nonsense, right?"

"Mm, mm, must follow up on this matter! Follow up!"

"No need to rush. The Acid and Alkali Plant lights the fire the day after tomorrow, and the Coal Chemical Plant still has to wait some time. According to Ji Situi, even the coal hasn't been transported enough."

"Fine, let's not talk about this first." Shi Niaoren remembered his main business wasn't finding antibiotics. He told Zhao Yanmei about some current hygiene conditions and proposed that the Pharmaceutical Factory had better make some commonly used medicines recently.

"...Antidiarrheals, physiological saline, glucose solution, and bleaching powder."

Zhao Yanmei said: "To be honest, what can be delivered immediately are only distilled water for injection, a dozen kinds of proprietary Chinese medicines, physiological saline, and alcohol. Even making glucose has difficulties..."

"Physiological saline still has problems," she continued, "First, the purity of sodium chloride in the salt transported from Yanchang Village is not enough; impurities are too many. Second, sulfuric acid is not enough. We dare not make physiological saline for infusion; let's make some for oral use first."

"What else do you need? I'll apply to the Planning Committee again!"

"Too many things are needed. I'm afraid the Planning Committee has no way either—Commissioner Ma doesn't have the ability to create something out of nothing." Zhao Yanmei smiled bitterly, "Doctor Shi, you should know that modern pharmacy is actually chemistry."

"You mean—" Shi Niaoren understood her meaning, "Chemical products are not enough?"

"More than just not enough; they are simply extremely scarce. Take the glucose rehydration solution you want; the glucose process is very simple, starch plus acidification method, easy to make. But I don't have acid: neither hydrochloric acid nor sulfuric acid. I have to use the enzymatic method, which is time-consuming and laborious, not to mention the PH value of the produced glucose can't be corrected—no alkali."

Shi Niaoren nodded.

"Also, gauze and absorbent cotton. Usually, they must be degreased first—caustic soda is needed. But caustic soda is very scarce now. Usable disinfectants are also not enough. The output products can only be said to be make-do. Fortunately, massive trauma cases are few." She stopped talking, "Currently, except for doing strain cultivation and proprietary Chinese medicines, the Pharmaceutical Factory really can't make anything particularly effective."

"Rest assured, these will be solved in a few days. The chemical plant in Bopu will be able to start production soon. I'll talk to the Planning Committee to let the Pharmaceutical Factory get priority." Shi Niaoren cheered her up.

"That's good. With the Three Acids and Two Alkalis, many things can be made." She got up and took a piece of paper from the desk drawer, "These are some matters needing coordination and urgently needed materials."

Shi Niaoren took it and saw quite a few items listed: requesting the machinery department to provide a special specification knitting machine for weaving gauze; a full set of tailoring equipment and workers who understand tailoring—this was for making masks; various extra-large pots, clay pots, iron pots... The order requirements for the glass factory were the most: a large number of vessels, pipes, and alcohol blast burners.

"Also small injection vials." Zhao Yanmei said, "This thing is hard to make. I'm afraid the glass factory isn't interested; the Planning Committee has to issue research and development instructions directly."

"You are preparing to make injections? Oxytetracycline injections?"

"Temporarily make Traditional Chinese Medicine injections first. Preparing to make some honeysuckle and Isatis root injections, and cardiotonics—extracting Atropine should be possible."

"This stuff—" Shi Niaoren still had some impression of the situation where TCM injections caused deaths back then, "Is it safe?"

"Not safe enough. The components of TCM extracts are mixed, and pharmacological principles are not clear enough. However, TCM injections like honeysuckle, Isatis root, and Shuanghuanglian have been used for decades, and the mortality rate is still acceptable; they are not considered very dangerous things. As for Atropine, it is originally a very dangerous thing. But Atropine is an important rescue drug, very useful, so we'll make it to try first."

"Alright." Shi Niaoren knew this was also a helpless move.

"I have another request." Zhao Yanmei continued, "All kinds of empty bottles used in the hospital, injection bottles, infusion bottles, medicine bottles, etc., had better be kept and transferred to the Pharmaceutical Factory. We can recycle them."

These things were indeed kept. According to the Planning Committee's regulations, any modern products could not be discarded at will; even if temporarily useless, they had to be reserved first.

"These are kept. And all washed and disinfected. But they are on the Planning Committee's account. I'll talk to the Planning Committee to approve them all for you."

"One more request—" Zhao Yanmei probably felt her request was a bit excessive, "Can you give us an X-ray machine?"

Shi Niaoren was startled. X-ray machine! This belonged to Special Controlled Equipment. Because it involved radioactive sources, the transmigrators exhausted their efforts to only get three units. They had to rely on them for at least a few decades. what did the Pharmaceutical Factory want this for?
