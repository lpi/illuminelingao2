# Chapter 1543 - To Each Their Own

When it comes to treating bruises, setting bones, or performing acupuncture, these are standard skills for people in the martial arts world. Every sect has its own secret recipes; of the various "elixirs" claiming to cleanse the marrow and replace tendons, if there aren't a thousand, there are at least five hundred. Leaving home without seventeen or eighteen small porcelain bottles in one's bosom would be a disgrace to one's title. Conversely, poisons and knockout drugs are rare—those are low-class tricks. Using them damages one's reputation, and getting caught by the authorities means a lawsuit: what law-abiding citizen runs around with poison?

Though every sect has its "behind-the-scenes backers," and many disciples come from gentry families—not commoners who must kneel before officials and cannot speak—the government is still not easy to deal with. So while people do concoct such drugs, they are not for public display.

"If we're opening a medicine shop, I don't have other skills, but bone-setting is no problem," the middle-aged man nodded.

"Uncle Jiao, your Northern Dragon Sect started as horse traders—isn't this your trade?" Zhou Zhongjun seemed excited. "I don't have skills to treat patients, but I can fetch things, serve tea, and help out."

The man called Uncle Jiao was Jiao Gongli, leader of the Northern Dragon Sect. His sect was a small one from Shanxi. Rather than a martial arts sect, it was more a group of horse traders beyond the Western Pass.

Horses are precious and delicate animals, prone to fractures and injuries. Those who raise and trade horses usually know a bit about bone-setting and have some unique herbal remedies. Besides treating horses, they treat people too—with excellent results. In the Ming and Qing dynasties, the most famous orthopedists in the capital were Mongols in the Court of the Imperial Stud who specialized in treating horses.

For the Northern Dragon Sect as a horse-trading organization, bone-setting was indeed Jiao Gongli's ancestral craft.

Jiao Gongli looked slightly embarrassed but smiled. "Miss Zhou serving me tea? How could a rough fellow like me deserve that? If Abbess Miejing knew, she'd skin me alive."

"Not at all. I can't do massage, can't diagnose—if I don't serve tea, what can I do?" Zhou Zhongjun was very enthusiastic about the "opening a shop" idea. The Hengshan Sect was all-female and strictly disciplined; daily life was dull. She was keen on such novelties.

Jiao Gongli laughed drily. Huang Zhen knew the girl just found it fresh and fun. Besides, her status was different; if someone really needed to serve tea, Nan Wan'er was more suitable.

But he couldn't spoil her fun now—her master, Abbess Miejing, was a key figure in the sect and strongly supported this operation. So he smiled, "Miss Zhou is talented in both civil and martial arts; how could you do menial work like serving tea? A medicine shop needs someone to record prescriptions and dispense medicine. You can do that."

Zhou Zhongjun just wanted to play; what she did didn't matter. She agreed readily.

Sima Qiudao sneered inwardly but, since Huang Zhen was in charge here, didn't say much.

"I know a little acupuncture too, but only gynecology..." Nan Wan'er whispered, sounding unconfident.

Before Huang Zhen could speak, Zhou Zhongjun laughed coldly and cut in, "Don't show off your petty tricks! In acupuncture, can you compare to Abbess Yiming or Junior Sister Anhui?"

Nan Wan'er immediately said, "I was just saying... if... if it's needed..."

Huang Zhen kept his amiable face. "Miss Nan's intentions are commendable. But we all depend on Miss Nan here. I couldn't bear to burden you further, haha, haha." He laughed it off and changed the subject.

Sima Qiudao said, "Since we're opening a medicine shop, we need medicines."

"That's fine. I have some bone-setting drugs with me," Jiao Gongli said.

Others also indicated they carried drugs that could serve temporarily.

"That's not what I mean," Sima Qiudao said. "It's true everyone has some pills, but for a medicine shop, it's too little. We aren't opening shop for just a day or two; what if we run out? Besides, the pills you brought are carefully prepared by your sects—precious ingredients aside, some took years or decades to refine. Giving them casually to commoners would be a huge waste, wouldn't it?"

Everyone nodded. Sima Qiudao continued, "Moreover, how can a small medicine shop need so many people? The Cropped-Hairs will be suspicious. But if we say we need to gather and compound herbs, it makes sense!"

Before he finished, someone clapped and laughed. "My worthy nephew puts it perfectly! With this pretext, we can go out freely to gather and buy herbs. Movement becomes much more convenient!"

The speaker was thin and tall, about fifty, with the air of a transcendent expert. He belonged to no sect—a local tyrant from the Funiu Mountains in Zhongzhou named Song Shengying. Originating from the Green Forest, he had washed his hands in a golden basin in middle age and returned to the righteous path. Rumor had it he was public-spirited and generous with money, so he had wide connections. He maintained good relations with officials, and martial artists called him "Living Mengchang." That he came personally surprised Sima Qiudao and was hard even for Huang Zhen to believe.

Huang Zhen nodded in agreement. This idea was clearly smarter than just opening a medicine shop; "freedom of movement" was worth a thousand gold. Though the Cropped-Hairs didn't restrict movement, if they frequented various parts of the county without valid reason, sooner or later they would attract attention. Now, whether going to the mountains or the towns, they could use gathering or buying herbs as an excuse.

"Villa Lord Song indeed has rich *jianghu* experience—worthy of a former Green Forest hero!" Zhou Zhongjun couldn't stay quiet and interjected. Song Shengying looked annoyed. Sima Qiudao knew he hated people mentioning his past in the Green Forest and was secretly amused—but also worried.

As an elder, Song Shengying couldn't bicker with a junior like Zhou Zhongjun. Besides, they were in the same boat; falling out benefited no one. He coughed and said, "Processing and compounding herbs, I can do. With Meng Liang and Meng Guang helping, we can run this medicine shop!"

Huang Zhen knew these two brothers lived in seclusion in the mountains year-round; herb gathering was their main livelihood. Martial artists couldn't eat wind and drink dew, nor could they rob the rich to feed the poor openly like bandits. Those with sects could rely on sect assets, but independents like Meng Liang and Meng Guang either relied on subsidies or their own skills.

The brothers, nearing middle age, were taciturn and stoic. Hearing Song Shengying, they merely nodded in agreement.

Song Shengying continued, "Brother Huang, we'll trouble you to be the shopkeeper. To survive here, we can't just act; we must do it for real! So put aside seniority for now. You put on the shopkeeper airs and order us to work hard."

Huang Zhen tried to be polite, but Zhou Zhongjun chirped, "Yes, yes, Senior Huang looks most like a shopkeeper!" She seemed more enthusiastic about opening the shop than anyone. Suddenly she frowned. "Hero Sima doesn't have a role yet! I think he'd make a perfect clerical advisor—he's always bookish and depressed, just like those sour scholars."

Sima Qiudao laughed heartily. Seeing the assignments were settled without objection, he said, "I won't be staying at the shop."

Zhou Zhongjun wondered, "Young Hero Sima, if you don't stay here, where will you go?"

Sima Qiudao said, "We can't all hole up in Nanbao Town. This is a mix of Han and Li people—a strategic point, but not the Cropped-Hairs' key area. We're safe here, but deaf and blind. Everything will be a beat slow..."

Though "Seventh Master" tried to send news every few days, and Sima Qiudao's group rotated going to East Gate Market to meet Xin Nachun, communication was inconvenient. Frequent messages and meetings carried great danger. So in his last secret letter, "Seventh Master" had instructed them to plant someone in East Gate Market. That way they could communicate via open signals without going through Xin Nachun or letters.

Ideally, he and Huang Zhen had discussed this a few days ago. They decided Sima Qiudao would infiltrate East Gate Market while Huang Zhen held down the fort in Nanbao.

"I want to go to East Gate Market too!" Zhou Zhongjun said hastily, forgetting her enthusiasm for the shop. "Young Hero Sima, take me with you."

Staying in this mining town had bored her to death. Hearing of East Gate Market's bustle and prosperity, she wanted to see the sights and relax.

Sima Qiudao smiled slightly and waved his hand. "That won't do. For Miss Zhou and I to go alone would be inconvenient..."

Zhou Zhongjun realized her request was abrupt. Both unmarried, a lone man and woman together—rumors would damage her reputation. She blushed. But she never backed down in words, so she spat, "Who's a lone man and woman with you? Dream on! Just going to East Gate Market to spy on the Cropped-Hairs together."

Sima Qiudao nodded and smiled. "It's excellent that Miss Zhou has this intent. Let me scout ahead first; it won't be too late for you to come later."

Song Shengying asked with concern, "What identity will my worthy nephew use in East Gate Market? You know the *Zhouyi*; you could pose as a fortune teller. Free movement, not conspicuous."

"Seventh Master said *jianghu* trades don't work under Cropped-Hair rule; catch you and it's digging sand and breaking rocks. I've been to East Gate Market a few times and never saw a physiognomist or fortune teller." Sima Qiudao frowned. "For now, as Miss Zhou said, finding a shop to work as a clerical advisor is the only way—though that restricts freedom of action."
