# Chapter 2678: The Capital (Part 30)

"This nephew wants to trouble Fourth Uncle with a matter." Since it was a secret talk, Wang Yehao didn't beat around the bush.

"Easy to say, easy to say." Wang Xiantong said with a grin, "Fourth Uncle got his wish this time and owes you a big favor!"

"With Fourth Uncle's talent and prestige, it is naturally so. This nephew just did a favor by pushing the boat with the current." Wang Yehao made a few polite remarks, then handed over a wax-sealed paper roll. "This nephew wants to send a message to Liu Zhao. I wonder if it is convenient on Fourth Uncle's side."

"What difficulty is there." Wang Xiantong took the paper roll. "Although it is the New Year festival, the *Zhenfusi* [Jinyiwei Office] also has people on duty. I will send someone to send it out today."

"Then many thanks to Fourth Uncle." Wang Yehao cupped his hands and asked again, "I wonder when this news can arrive?"

Wang Xiantong thought for a moment and said, "The postal deadline to Guangzhou Prefecture is fifty-six days. If it is an urgent document, it is thirty-two days. The *Zhenfusi* here also has a flying pigeon transmission line, but it can only communicate a few words and cannot deliver formal documents. Moreover, birds may suffer damage on the way, so mostly secret messages are sent together through multiple routes to ensure the news is not lost."

Wang Yehao calculated the dates, then said, "It's not an urgent matter. No need for express. Ensuring it arrives is enough."

"Haha, with our *Zhenfusi* handling things, my worthy nephew can rest assured."

Wang Yehao drank a mouthful of tea to relax, thinking that having someone serving in the *Zhenfusi* was indeed convenient. Recently, he had gradually realized its benefits; whether inquiring about news or secret contact, it was "swifter" and "more secret" than official channels. No wonder the Emperors relied on the Factory and Guard as their belly and heart.

Putting down the teacup, he said, "Speaking of the *Zhenfusi* personnel, Liu Zhao said he has a brother named Liu Sha who also serves in the *Zhenfusi*, only he has no assignment nowadays. He begged me to give his brother a job. Does Fourth Uncle recognize this person?"

"Have some impression. Seems he sets up a fortune-telling stall in the South City market; should have hereditary skills in geomancy."

"Oh? Liu Zhao recommended this person. I wonder if Fourth Uncle thinks he is usable?"

"Before, it was hard to say, but recently maybe it can work. Don't know what bewildering soup those Donglin people fed the Emperor, he actually banned official surveillance, causing many children to lose their livelihood." Wang Xiantong complained a bit, then said, "Liu Sha's batch should have also suffered the cut. If you want to recruit him now, it shouldn't be difficult. If my worthy nephew is interested, I will let him go to your residence to serve tomorrow."

"Good." Wang Yehao nodded thoughtfully. "Speaking of the Emperor cutting the Factory and Guard, I wonder what plans Fourth Uncle has?"

Wang Xiantong frowned and said, "This is the Sacred Will; subjects naturally should follow. It's just quite thorny. After the Wei Rebel committed suicide in fear of punishment, the Eunuch Party personnel are all in a state of constant anxiety. Back then, he repeatedly instigated major prison cases, killing many people and owing so many blood debts. How could the Donglin Party spare them! Only those serving in the Factory and Guard under orders, I fear, will also be implicated."

"Fourth Uncle need not worry. This Nephew will naturally mediate on the Donglin side. However, Tian Ergeng probably cannot be saved. Fourth Uncle might as well contact secretly and report him first, avoiding the disaster of pond fish [collateral damage] and establishing the merit of restoring order."

Wang Xiantong was stunned, then praised immediately: "What my worthy nephew says is reasonable..."

Seeing Fourth Uncle still hesitating slightly, Wang Yehao added: "Fourth Uncle, do not hesitate. This Tian Ergeng attached himself to the Wei Rebel, repeatedly instigated major prison cases, and his methods were cruel. Not to mention the Donglin lineage, even other ministers in the court mostly want to put him to death—the 'Five Tigers' are people who must die; everyone wants to beat the drowning dog. Fourth Uncle reporting him is just complying with the general trend."

If it were in the past, Wang Yehao wouldn't have spoken so absolutely. Ever since "Immortal Zhou's" greatest prophecy—"Eunuch Party destruction, Nine Thousand Years suicide, Prince Xin ascension"—came true, he had believed the prophecies in the "Codebook" without reservation.

Who to impeach, who not to impeach, "Hearthstone Daoist" had already given him a list. He only needed to follow the pattern to draw the gourd and submit memorials. Hundred shots, hundred hits.

"Good, good, I'll listen to you!"

"Just now Fourth Uncle said many children lost their livelihood. This Nephew's residence is short of hands recently. If there are suitable ones, I hope Fourth Uncle can recommend one or two."

"Easy to say, easy to say."

In the afternoon of the next day, Wang Yehao indeed heard servants report that a face-reading Daoist was begging to see him at the gate. He wouldn't leave even when given money, insisting on seeing the Master. When the guards wanted to drive him away, they couldn't move with just a brush of his hand.

"...He also said he came by recommendation, not some wandering wild Daoist."

"Oh? Came by recommendation?" Wang Yehao knew this was likely Liu Zhao's brother. It seemed he had some skills.

"Let him in." Wang Yehao instructed the servants to bring him to the study.

Before long, a Daoist with grizzled beard and hair and a face full of gullies appeared before Wang Yehao.

"Poor Daoist Liu Sha greets the Master." The Daoist flicked his horsetail whisk and bowed with cupped hands.

Looking at his clothes, they were truly dirty, fitting the image of a physiognomist making a living in the market. "Not showing open appearance [Don't look like a spy]" was a basic requirement for secret detectives.

"Daoist Master asks to see me today; I wonder what for?" Wang Yehao deliberately feinted, wanting to see how the other party would react.

The Daoist didn't panic either, saying with a chuckle: "Recently, the Poor Daoist's incense fire has withered, and the purse is shy. Hearing that the Master here wants to set up an altar for rituals and pray for blessings to dispel disasters, I specially come to recommend myself."

Wang Yehao also smiled and handed over the recommendation note written by Liu Zhao earlier: "Does the Daoist Master know Liu Zhao?"

"Liu Zhao is indeed my clan brother. Ranking-wise, I have to call him Second Brother." The Daoist looked at the note and replied, "Previously heard him mention serving in the Master's residence, but haven't seen him for two years."

Wang Yehao looked at the other party, feeling somewhat suspicious in his heart. Liu Zhao was only just over thirty. Originally he thought the brother he mentioned wouldn't be over forty, but the one who came today looked like fifty or sixty no matter how one looked, yet he had to call Liu Zhao 'Second Brother'.

"May I ask Daoist Master, what is your noble age this year?"

Since the note already explained it, the Daoist stopped playing Tai Chi: "Hehe, presumably the Master also knows. I, like Liu Zhao, also serve in the *Zhenfusi*. Only usually I don't handle errands in the Yamen but set up a stall in the south of the city, using the banner of face reading to do the work of surveillance and secret investigation. In the trade of geomancy, if the skin looks too tender, no one believes it, so I intentionally dress to look older. In reality, I just turned thirty this year."

"Unexpectedly, your Excellency's trade is like officialdom; one has to endure for seniority." Wang Yehao wanted to laugh hearing him say this. Speaking of tender skin, which physiognomist in the *Jianghu* was more tender than Immortal Zhou? But when he gave a verdict, that was called speaking of things like a god, a hundred spirits and a hundred verifications.

"The Master is joking." Liu Sha waved his hand and continued, "This outfit and appearance are just to fool some foolish men and women. If speaking of geomancy and Feng Shui, face reading and fate principles, one still has to rely on true skill."

Wang Yehao stroked his beard thoughtfully: "Since it is so, this Official has a difficult matter and wants to ask your Excellency."

"Master, please speak."

"Last year on the way back to the capital, I took in two new maids. This Official only wants to keep one obedient one. Trouble your Excellency to select one for this Official." Wang Yehao immediately ordered people to bring the two maids who previously served the Hearthstone Daoist. After separating from him, these two maids had basically entered the Cold Palace for the past half-year. Except for plenty of daily food, few people greeted them usually. Being brought to the Master's study inexplicably today, with a strange Daoist standing in the room, both were somewhat apprehensive.

Liu Sha knew the other party was weighing his weight, so he dared not neglect. He scrutinized the two maids carefully, then said: "Two young ladies, lend me your hands."

Hearing the Daoist say he wanted to read palmistry, the two maids were slightly coy. However, since the head of the house didn't seem to object, they had to shrinkingly extend their hands.

Liu Sha looked for a while, then asked one of them, "May I ask this young lady's fragrant name?"

"The name given by Mr. Zhou on the road, called Zhiling." The maid replied tremblingly.

"Mr. Zhou is an advisor in the residence." Wang Yehao introduced the character background.

Liu Sha nodded, then continued to say to Zhiling: "Looking at this young lady's hand lines, it is a face of rebirth after calamity. Presumably, the harvest in your hometown must be good this year. Leaving the registry and redeeming yourself shouldn't be far off."

"Is what the Daoist Master says true?" The girl's eyes lit up hearing this, but her gaze dimmed immediately: "Sigh, my body contract costs twenty taels. Father and Mother probably can't take out this much money. If I go back, I still have to suffer the white eyes of my brother and sister-in-law. Although there are many rules here, at least I don't get scolded for eating."

Liu Sha comforted her with a chuckle for a few sentences, then turned to chat with Jieyi. After a while, Liu Sha retreated and cupped his hands to Wang Yehao, indicating he had asked clearly.

Wang Yehao ordered the two maids to wait outside the door, then asked Liu Sha: "Does your Excellency have a candidate?"

"In my opinion, the Master has such a large family business and numerous servants up and down the residence; it's not that you can't afford to feed one or two mouths. Choosing people today, presumably, is to perform an extraordinary matter." Liu Sha stole a glance at Wang Yehao's expression. Seeing him slightly surprised, he knew he must have hit the mark, so he continued, "I boldly speculate that since only one person is selected, it must involve secrets and requires a tight-lipped person. Jieyi is better than Zhiling."

"How does your Excellency make this verdict?"

"Hehe, just used some small tricks." Liu Sha smiled with disapproval. "I saw old calluses on Zhiling's hands and determined she came from a farming household. Perhaps she was sold as a slave due to a bad year. So I specially bluffed her a few sentences. Unexpectedly, without much effort, she revealed her background completely. In comparison, Jieyi is more reliable."

"Good means." Wang Yehao nodded in agreement, then suddenly asked faintly, "Your Excellency has been in the capital for a long time; wonder if you have investigated this Official?"

Hearing this, Liu Sha hurriedly bowed down: "Master rest assured. I know the rules. Since I am throwing myself to the Master, I will be loyal and undivided hereafter."

"En. Handle errands with all your heart; this Official won't treat you unfairly."

"Thank the Master for taking me in." Liu Sha kowtowed three loud heads on the spot.

After the other party stood up, Wang Yehao handed over a folding fan. The painting and calligraphy on the fan face were ordinary, with the signature "Shi Weng" [Stone Old Man]. Liu Sha examined it for a moment, not understanding. Wang Yehao explained with a serious face: "Whoever holds this fan is a subordinate of this Official. When meeting in the future, it's good to have something to look after each other."
