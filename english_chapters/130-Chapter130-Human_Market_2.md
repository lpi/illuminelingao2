# Chapter 130 - Human Market (2)

Sure enough, it was not a free market inside. As soon as these well-dressed people entered, many human traffickers came up to promote their goods:

"What do you think of this one? A mouthful of glutinous rice teeth, fine and white—how about fifteen taels?"

"Look at this girl's hair, pitch black..."

"Don't mind the older age of this one I have; she can read! Born in a scholarly family. The madam of Jincui Lou (Golden Jade Pavilion) was willing to pay fifty taels, but I didn't sell!"

"You gentlemen want someone to serve, right? This girl is just right. Originally a maid of a big household in Fujian, well-trained, looks and figure are all passable! I'll give a fixed price, twenty-five taels!"

...

The noisy scene confused Xiao Zishan and his group for a while. When had they ever seen such a scene? These seven or eight people were pulling girls towards them with saliva flying, fiddling with hair and pulling up sleeves to show skin. These girls, ranging from eleven or twelve to just over twenty, all looked decent but were sallow and emaciated. Being pinched and rubbed by the traffickers, they wanted to cry but didn't dare, looking like they were holding back tears and swallowing grief. Xiao Zishan's heart sank; indeed a miserable sight. Several people around him also showed unbearable expressions.

Two escorts quickly stepped forward to block the traffickers. Liu Gang turned back and asked Xiao Zishan: "Great Shopkeeper, do you want to buy a few children?"

Xiao Zishan was somewhat indecisive. It seemed that almost all slightly good-looking girls here had been bought by traffickers. The price of each girl ranged from six taels to fifty taels. There were thirty or forty in total. Buying them all would be a bit expensive. Besides, they were a bit young; were these twelve or thirteen-year-old girls considered teenagers or children? While hesitating, Yan Maoda said: "Committee Member Xiao, let's just do a group purchase. We can haggle fiercely."

"Even with haggling, it will cost hundreds of taels." Zhang Xin shook his head, "Let's start with those the traffickers are not interested in. When we buy a lot, seeing we are not interested in their goods, they will reduce prices to clear stock."

"This is good. Originally, we planned to buy some children back to raise and educate."

"What's the budget? I need a bottom line."

"Under five hundred taels. Exceeding a bit is also fine."

The group got rid of the traffickers and walked straight inside. They saw starving refugees fleeing famine everywhere in the open spaces of the shacks along the road, supporting the old and carrying the young. Cries for help rose one after another without end.

A large group of people gathered at the intersection ahead. They approached and looked, seeing a woman pulling a man's leg, wailing and begging there. In a pile of rags on the ground were two children, the older one only three or four years old, and the smaller one still in swaddling clothes. It turned out the woman's whole family fled here from famine, and family members had all died, leaving only this mother and two children. The trafficker fancied the woman but didn't want the children.

The woman had been beaten bleeding from nose and mouth, lying on the ground. The trafficker kicked her while scolding: "You slut who won't starve to death! I don't run a charity; why raise your children!" Grabbing the woman's hair, he was about to drag her away.

Zhang Xin was about to speak when suddenly someone shouted: "Stop!" The crowd separated, and several family guards came over, clustering around a young man about thirty years old. Whispers rose from the crowd: "Young Master Liang is here, Young Master Liang is here."

The man walked up to the trafficker: "Since you buy her, why force her to leave her children! These two children are so young; without a mother, isn't it a dead end!"

The trafficker seemed to recognize the comer and hurriedly defended: "You see clearly! It's not easy for us to eat this bowl of rice. With her sickly body dragging two children, which buyer would want her? If I agree to her, I have to feed two more mouths for nothing."

Young Master Liang said angrily: "If you can't earn from it, just don't buy. Why force separation of flesh and blood!"

The trafficker smiled bitterly: "Fine, fine, my good intentions turned into bad deeds. In her state, if I don't buy, her whole family will starve to death tomorrow! At least I can save her alone."

Although these words were almost roguish, they were also the truth. Young Master Liang couldn't say anything for a moment. The trafficker dared not say more, dropped the person, and slipped away from the crowd. Zhang Xin looked at the woman on the ground again. Actually, she was just over twenty, her face thin and out of shape, but there was an abnormal flush on her sallow skin, looking indeed sick. Young Master Liang asked a servant to buy a few steamed buns for her and scattered some money to the hungry refugees surrounding the road.

"Let's buy them." Guo Yi couldn't bear it.

Xiao Zishan thought this wasn't very good. First, she was sick; second, the children with her were too young; buying them back would be a burden. After hesitating a bit, seeing everyone looking at him, he nodded: "Buy them!"

Seeing several traveling merchants bought the woman's whole family, the crowd here was instantly stirred. It spread immediately in the human market. Refugees, old, young, male, female, squeezed to the front, more and more, surrounding them tightly, all begging them to take them in, asking for no selling price, just a mouthful of food.

It became chaotic for a while. Fortunately, Liu Gang had some experience. He busily squeezed out with the escorts and asked the runners and militia present to help maintain order. Xiao Zishan had Gao Ju's calling card in hand and immediately rewarded a few thousand cash. The runners dared not neglect and hurriedly found an official broker over, writing selling contracts like flowing water.

People around soon discovered that these few people particularly fancied children, especially young children whom no one cared about in the past. Seeing one, they took one. Parents wanting to go along were also taken in. Orphans were even more welcome. Zhang Xin was generous. Anyway, no body price was paid. For every purchase, he gave the runners and official brokers present five hundred wen. The runners responsible for suppression simply grabbed all the orphans in the field, willing or not, to write selling contracts. In a short while, seventy or eighty children and about forty adult men and women were acquired. Seeing these people so generous, traffickers hurriedly went up to ask for sales. Zhang Xin shook his head: "Checking one by one is a waste of time. I'll take all the children in your hands."

After some bargaining, finally, all forty-one girls in the hands of traffickers were bought at ten taels each. For a time, the space in front of the abandoned temple was packed with people.

Xiao Zishan asked an escort to notify Sun Kecheng: vacate a large mule and horse shop, quickly light fires to cook, and invite a few doctors to stand by. Those who signed selling contracts were escorted by two escorts in groups of twenty to the inn. For the weak and sick, he ordered people to hire mule carts to transport them.

While busy, suddenly a family guard came over and said something to Liu Gang. Liu Gang looked respectful and came to say to Xiao Zishan: "Young Master Liang wants to invite the shopkeepers over for a chat."

Guo Yi asked: "Who is this Young Master Liang?"

Liu Gang said: "He is a Juren (provincial graduate) of this county, from a family of generations of officials, always zealous for public welfare and justice, having a very good reputation in the county. He wants to invite these shopkeepers over for a chat."

Several people looked at each other, feeling it necessary to befriend such local gentry. Zhang Xin continued to stay to arrange the sending of servants, and others followed the servant out of the field.

At the edge of the wasteland, there was a tea shed selling tea and steamed buns, originally a place for traffickers and suppressing runners to rest. At this moment, inside and out were all replaced by family guards and servants brought by Young Master Liang, no less than twenty or thirty people. Everyone was surprised: Such a small Juren has such a big pomp!

This Young Master Liang was about twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old, with a slightly pale face, looking like a noble young master. Wearing a gray pongee long gown, holding a fan sprinkled with gold, although not luxurious, he was clean and spotless. Seeing them coming, he was not arrogant either, standing up and cupping his hands in greeting first:

"Liang Cunhou." The young master smiled slightly, a pair of dark pupils flashing under his eight-character eyebrows (sloping eyebrows), and said: "May I ask the honorable titles of the shopkeepers? Where are you from?"

While speaking, his eyes looked Guo Yi and others up and down faintly. His gaze was extremely experienced. Guo Yi couldn't help being startled: This person's eyes were sharp, definitely not possessed by ordinary hedonistic sons of rich parents. He repeatedly said: "Dare not, dare not," and reported the names of several people in turn.

According to the unified story, they were all maritime merchants. Because the sea surface was not peaceful, they were stranded here, accompanied by Liu Gang to stroll on the streets to relax.

Servants served tea. Young Master Liang asked again: "Since you are maritime merchants, why buy so many family members?" Saying this, a look of suspicion appeared in his eyes.

Xiao Zishan had already prepared a response: "In recent years, the sea surface has been uneven, and business is harder day by day, so we thought of buying some land to set up farms and collect rent for a living. We bought land to reclaim in Qiongzhou. There are few people there, and tenants and long-term laborers often have no spouses, so we had to come here to buy some women."

"That is also a good deed." Young Master Liang sighed with emotion, "I saw you pitying the weak and sick just now, unwilling to separate flesh and blood, willing to take in even young children, and arranging food and lodging properly. Truly kind-hearted and benevolent. As natives of Guangzhou, we are really ashamed!"

"Where, where." Guo Yi and others hurriedly declined modestly, feeling this Young Master Liang was a bit pretentious. The transmigrators came from modern times and completely didn't understand the cruel side of ancient society. They always felt that since they bought people as servants, full stomachs and warm clothes were the minimum treatment. Not paying wages seemed like taking a huge advantage already.

Liu Gang took the opportunity to say some flattering words: "Young Master Liang has always been charitable in this county. Not to mention Nanhai County, even in the whole Guangzhou Prefecture, who doesn't know Young Master Liang's great benevolence and righteousness. You don't know: the silver spent on the porridge shed here is mostly taken from the Liang residence."

Liang Cunhou didn't mind, waving his hand: "Nowadays the world is not peaceful. Fortunately, Guangdong is still quiet. My Liang family has received national grace for generations, not comparable to poor families. Having some meager property at home, doing good deeds with meager strength is just sharing a little worry for the imperial court. What is lamentable is that regarding my relief of hungry people in my humble county, I am surprisingly not understood by the gentry of the hometown, and there is quite some gossip behind my back." Saying this, he sighed deeply.

Seeing he had quite some difficulties, Guo Yi deliberately pretended to be confused: "Young Master Liang relieving hungry people is a great good deed. Why is there gossip?"
