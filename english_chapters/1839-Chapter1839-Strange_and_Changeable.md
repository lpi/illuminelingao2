# Chapter 1839 - Strange and Changeable

Lian Nishang sneered: "This isn't Fangchun Court's land? The land deed is still stored in the City Hall."

"Whose land deed it is, this servant doesn't know and can't control, but this courtyard is now the Liang Residence's outer household. Without the order of my Master or Young Master, no one is allowed to enter. If you want to come in to investigate a case, please possess a card from your Master sent to this residence. This servant will naturally sweep the steps to wait," the maid said. "As for now, please go back. Pardon me for not seeing you out." Saying this, she raised her voice: "See—guests—out—"

This maid was arrogant and self-assured, completely disregarding Lian Nishang and her group. Li Ziyu knew a bit about Lian Nishang's temper—she was one to yield to soft tactics but not force, and she was extremely hostile towards everything of the Ming, especially officials and gentry, regarding them almost as enemies. He couldn't help but worry secretly that things would blow up beyond control.

What if she really pulled her gun and shot this girl? Li Ziyu worried secretly. Not to mention this was a "favored" head maid, even if it were an ordinary servant beaten to death, the Liang family wouldn't let it go easily.

Sure enough, Lian Nishang gave a brief order: "Corporal, fix bayonets!"

With one order, the National Army soldiers pulled out their bayonets in unison. In an instant, they fixed them onto their rifles. A row of snow-bright bayonets flashed in the courtyard. The two house guards who had originally come up to "see the guests out" couldn't help but shrink back, showing timid expressions.

At this critical juncture, someone suddenly shouted loudly: "Wait!"

The voice was high and sharp. Everyone in the courtyard paused involuntarily.

Following the voice, a woman walked quickly down from the main room, almost trotting all the way to Lian Nishang. She fell to her knees with a plop, first knocked her head heavily on the ground, and said: "Servant Yuewan pays respects to this officer."

This sudden turn of events was so strange and changeable that not only Lian Nishang and the others were stunned, but even the servants in the courtyard were dazed.

Li Ziyu looked closely and saw this woman was around eighteen or nineteen, with beautiful features and moist eyes. She wore a deep blue brocade skirt with dotting plum blossoms on the hem, and a water-red jacket over it. Her jet-black hair was done up in a Ruyi bun, with only a white jade plum blossom hairpin inserted. While simple, she didn't lose her freshness and elegance.

So this was the "mistress" *shoulong* by Master Liang. Li Ziyu thought, such a woman, although a *laoju*, was someone he could hardly dream of seeing, let alone get intimate with, in the past.

He had originally thought this must be a pampered and flamboyant woman, unexpectedly she was willing to be so humble.

Lian Nishang was also stunned, and only said after a while: "You are Yuewan?"

"Yes, this servant is." Yuewan replied with her head lowered. "Just now this servant was resting in the back and didn't know the officer had arrived. The servants are stupid and rude, offending you greatly. Please don't haggle with them, officer. This servant apologizes here." Saying this, she kowtowed again and said, "Offending the officer is always due to this servant's lack of discipline. If the officer has any punishment, this servant dares not complain."

Li Ziyu never dreamed the situation would change so quickly. Yuewan acting so humble immediately dampened Lian Nishang's momentum of forcible search. For a moment, she couldn't think of anything to respond with.

Seeing this, Yuewan said again: "Officers, please come to the front hall first, let this servant serve tea. Whatever orders you have, please give them, this servant will definitely comply and never disobey."

Lian Nishang said: "You, stand up and speak!" Waiting for her to rise, she then said, "No need for tea. We stated our purpose for coming here just now. We hope you cooperate with our work."

Yuewan said "yes" several times. Lian Nishang then asked about Mingnu's whereabouts.

"This girl is indeed in this servant's courtyard, only I don't know if she is called Mingnu..." Yuewan said. "If the officer is looking for her, this servant will have someone bring her out and hand her over to the officer immediately."

Li Ziyu originally thought she would try every means to shirk and deny it to the death. Unexpectedly, she admitted it immediately. Lian Nishang was probably also a bit surprised and asked: "If so, why did your maid deny it?"

Yuewan whispered: "It's always this servant's lack of discipline. You, sir, see clearly, she is a favorite in the Liang Residence and is somewhat spoiled usually." After saying that, she turned around: "Suiyun!"

That head maid had been standing with arms akimbo, looking unconvinced. Hearing Yuewan call her, she immediately replied: "Servant is here."

"Kneel!" Yuewan shouted. Suiyun trembled all over, her beautiful eyes reddened, but she dared not disobey and fell to her knees with a plop.

"The officers are handling a case. First, you didn't report to me; second, you didn't discuss with the officers. Rude and arrogant to the extreme! Where did the books you read usually go?!"

Although Suiyun's face was full of defiance, she dared not talk back a word. For every scolding sentence from Yuewan, she knocked her head on the ground once, saying "Servant deserves death," tears flowing uncontrollably.

Li Ziyu knew this maid was usually proud and arrogant. Being humiliated by Yuewan like this, her shame and resentment could be imagined. He couldn't help but feel a vague sympathy in his heart.

Yuewan scolded a few sentences, then said: "Liang Quan, Liang Shun, bring the family discipline tools. Beat her forty strokes!"

The servants hurriedly responded, ran to get the tools, dragged Suiyun to the ground, and began beating her with cracking sounds.

"It is always this servant's fault." Yuewan said humbly, "If anyone else here is at fault and the officer wants to take them back for interrogation, this servant has no objection. In short, it is all up to the officer's disposal."

Lian Nishang felt like she punched a cotton quilt; she couldn't apply any force. Just as she wanted to say something, a servant woman came over from behind leading a little girl. Li Ziyu recognized her at a glance—it was Mingnu, who had been missing for more than ten days!

She was dressed neatly, and her complexion was fair. Presumably, she hadn't suffered much in terms of food and clothing, only her small face was full of fear and timidity. One could imagine the suffering she had endured these days.

If not for Gao Chongjiu, Lian Nishang, and the Australians, Mingnu would have fallen into the dust forever, doomed eternally! Thinking of how he had been running back and forth these days, chasing Mingnu's tracks everywhere only to come up empty repeatedly... all sorts of sweet, sour, bitter, and spicy feelings surged to his heart. He walked up a few steps involuntarily, called out "Mingnu!", and pulled the timid Mingnu into his arms, tears falling uncontrollably.

Mingnu had been frightened quite a bit and was somewhat dull. Li Ziyu was the first acquaintance she saw these days—her uncle's good friend. She had been beaten into fearing to cry, but now held in Li Ziyu's arms, the grievances and fear of so many days suddenly erupted. She couldn't help but wail loudly. Crying, she said:

"Uncle Jade, Uncle Jade, why did you only come now..."

Li Ziyu had originally planned to pretend not to know Mingnu to avoid revealing the tail of "using public office for private gain," but now he could no longer hide the emotions in his heart. Hugging Mingnu tightly as if afraid someone would snatch her away, he said: "Uncle Jade came to save you! Don't be afraid! Uncle Jade will take you home right now!" His voice also choked up.

Everyone present was moved. Several police officers understood somewhat in their hearts, sighing one after another. Although Lian Nishang was expressionless, her eyes also reddened. She said: "Don't cry anymore. It's good that the person is found. Take her back to record a statement first..."

Yuewan bit her lip tightly on the side, fully understanding what had happened. Madam Han had violated a taboo and bought someone she shouldn't have! This not only ruined Fangchun Court but would also implicate Master Liang's side. She trembled: "It's Madam Han who had no eyes! This servant was also confused for a moment, lacking a little maid. Seeing her cleverness, I asked for her, not knowing I offended the Master's tiger prestige. I deserve ten thousand deaths..." Saying this, she knelt down again.

Lian Nishang said: "Get up!" She still had a question in her heart and asked: "Since you wanted a little girl to serve, why did you have to choose by birth date and horoscope?"

"Many thanks for the officer's magnanimity." Yuewan stood up and smiled apologetically, "There is a reason for this too. This servant's body has always been poor. Not long ago, I asked a physiognomist to look at it. He said there was a problem with this servant's ** [Note: text missing/corrupted in source, likely referring to destiny/fate], and the people serving around me must match ** and **, to avoid **."

This explanation was reasonable. Lian Nishang nodded. She asked a few more questions about the situation in the courtyard. Yuewan answered clearly without ambiguity. While they were talking, a house guard came back to report: "Forty strokes have been finished. Please give instructions, Miss."

Li Ziyu turned his eyes to the courtyard and saw Suiyun, who had just been bossy, lying on a spring bench with disheveled hair, face covered in sweat, trembling all over from pain.

Yuewan, originally smiling, changed her expression and said coldly: "Beat another twenty."

The house guard was stunned but dared not disobey, so he had to retreat to continue the punishment. The cracking sound of boards rising and falling in the courtyard mixed with Suiyun's gradually fading groans of pain. Those present showed unbearable expressions.

A master punishing a slave was not illegal as long as no one died. Moreover, this was the Liang family's domestic affair and irrelevant to the case, so Lian Nishang naturally couldn't interfere. As for the Liang family's servants, they dared not say a word.

At this moment, Zhao Gui suddenly interjected. He took a step forward and said to Yuewan: "Yue... Miss, don't beat anymore... she will die..."

Yuewan saw that although he wore the Aussie yamen runner's uniform, he exuded a rustic and dull air from head to toe. She hadn't paid him any mind originally, not expecting him to suddenly interject and plead for mercy. She hesitated and said: "This officer is kind-hearted! Sir, rest assured, this is a small board. This servant was beaten with it since childhood—it won't kill anyone! Disciplining her with a few more strokes now is also for her own good!"

Seeing the very bad expression on Lian Nishang's face, she hurriedly added: "Since this officer has spoken, let's spare her this time!" Turning her head, she shouted to the courtyard: "Stop."

"I originally decided never to spare lightly. Now that this officer pleads for you," Yuewan said seriously, "Why don't you come up and thank him!"

Suiyun could no longer move her steps. Two servant women supported her left and right, barely bringing her to the steps. She knelt in front of Zhao Gui and panted: "Thank you for your grace, officer..." Saying this, she was about to kowtow.

Zhao Gui waved his hands wildly: "No, no. Don't kowtow."

Yuewan said: "Today, with this officer pleading for you, we'll let it pass. If there is such arbitrary and domineering behavior in the future, I will definitely break your legs!"
