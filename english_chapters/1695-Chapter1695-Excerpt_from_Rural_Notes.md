# Chapter 1695 - Excerpt from Rural Notes

*Lingao Times* Editor's Note:

As the "First Five-Year Plan" reaches its concluding year, agricultural and rural work faces great difficulty and unprecedented challenges. This newspaper is continuously publishing the "Notes from Staying in the Village" by Comrade Yun Suji, a Senator active on the Senate's agricultural front. Through the vivid examples under his pen, we feel more truly the current status of "agricultural development lagging, rural grassroots being soft, and farmers' lives being unsatisfactory," and understand more profoundly Secretary of State Ma's important instruction at the Twelfth State Council Meeting that "the policy of transforming rural areas and transforming farmers cannot change, and the intensity cannot be reduced."

Main Text:

Only by being grounded can one have confidence. Facing the myriad threads of rural work, only by sinking one's heart and going deep into the front line can one understand the thoughts and hopes of the farmer masses, grasp the truth of current rural work, and seize the initiative in the work of "agriculture, rural areas, and farmers." To resolve the difficulties in agricultural and rural development, there should be more of such down-to-earth investigations.

Recently I have frequently gone to the countryside, sometimes running to five or six villages a day from dawn to dusk, but often it was just looking at flowers from a galloping horse, coming and going in a rush, knowing little about the truth and not researching difficulties thoroughly. Recently staying in a village in Haikou rural area for investigation has allowed me to make up for the regrets of previous rural investigations.

Sunny turning to cloudy, northwest wind force 3-4 turning to 5-6.

Early this morning I rushed to Tankou Village, Longtang Town, a new immigrant settlement under Pingshen Ridge. This time could be considered "light carriage and simple entourage," bringing only 2 guards and taking a Heaven and Earth Society fishing boat upstream along the river. To avoid layers of accompaniment and not interfere with the work of county and township comrades, I didn't greet them at all. I wanted to poke down to the bottom with one pole, quietly stay in the village, and do my best to achieve "village not disturbing people, county not disturbing officials."

Just past 9 am, we arrived at Tankou. This is a standard village west of the Nandu River. The villagers' houses are as neat as military barracks. The whole village has more than 160 immigrant households with over 500 people. Dry land mainly grows sweet potatoes, irrigated land grows double-cropping rice plus a season of green manure, and various miscellaneous grains are planted on marginal lands. According to county cadres, the economic level belongs to the lower-middle among immigrant villages, but it is not the poorest village.

I thought there would be more people in the village during the farming slack season, but after entering the village I didn't see many people. Only after finding the village head did I know that most people in the village had gone to perform corvée labor. After entering the village, I didn't look for a place to live first. The first thing was to propose to Village Head Old Huo: "Now is exactly the time for farmland water conservancy construction. Matters of eating and living are not urgent, let's go to the construction site to see the situation first."

Village Head Old Huo is in his 40s, simple and honest. He is an outstanding cadre we selected from Shandong immigrants. He didn't want me to go, "The construction site is full of water and mud, Chief, you just look from here." I insisted on going, "It doesn't matter. What's the point of going to the countryside if afraid of dirt and hardship? I'll stay in your village tonight, time is definitely enough."

On the way, Old Huo mentioned that there were too many low-lying wetlands around the village, often causing waterlogging when there was much rain in summer. "Perfectly good land, can't be planted!"

Only after walking did I realize there really were quite a few low-lying lands here! This is land silted up by a backwater bend of the Nandu River, worthy of being called a water village. Ponds and pools are scattered like stars on a chessboard. really after taking quite a detour, we arrived at the water conservancy project site. As soon as arriving at the site, I saw a young lad in his 20s driving a "Simmental" breed yellow ox to pump water.

Many people gathered above and below the ditch, all digging earth and carrying it with shoulder poles. Tools were relatively simple, basically digging by humans and carrying on shoulders; there weren't even many wheelbarrows. The groundwater level here is high. It is the dry season now, but there was accumulated water submerging calves at the bottom of the ditch, necessitating constant water pumping by oxen. Migrant workers all rolled up their pant legs to work in the water. Although the weather here is much warmer than on the mainland, the water temperature in winter is also very low. I couldn't help but feel deeply how not easy it is for farmers.

Directing the construction on the embankment was a young girl, looking less than twenty years old, yet very experienced in her work. I asked and found out that the project here was designed by her, and she was also responsible for presiding over the construction.

I was secretly surprised that she was designing and presiding over projects at such a young age. Asking further, I learned she was actually a high student of the architectural planning grandmaster, Senator Ji Runzhi, and had already studied with Senator Ji for five years. She is a rare all-round naturalized citizen construction engineer. She and her senior brother Ji Shu have been engaged in design and construction work since they were sixteen. Projects designed and built by them are all over Hainan, Taiwan, and Jeju. Truly, heroes come from youths since ancient times.

I asked about the specific construction situation. Ji Yuan introduced that this was a drainage system, including drainage channels and supporting sluices and ponds. After completion, it could drain excess accumulated water from about 1000 mu of land.

"Currently, the terrain of Tankou is unfavorable for agricultural production," Ji Yuan told me. "Part of the cultivated land here is in the hilly area by the river, with high terrain needing water lifting for irrigation, while another part by the river is low-lying, needing drainage instead."

Listening to her words, it seemed that for agricultural production here to have a new situation, more labor and resources must be invested.

Seeing the scene of labor in full swing, I couldn't restrain myself from participating. I asked the guard who went with me to lead the ox in front, and I drove the ox from behind. In a short while, I was sweating profusely. I took off my coat and threw it in the grass at the edge of the field. The young lad immediately picked up the clothes and held them in his arms. This small detail touched me.

The "Simmental" ox pulled the waterwheel with effort but was very obedient. An old lady boiling water nearby told me, "This ox is going to give birth to a calf in another 10 days or so. Can't let the ox walk too fast, afraid of tiring it out."

I asked whose family this ox belonged to. The old lady said this was a jointly hitched animal. It turned out most villagers were relatively poor and couldn't afford to hitch a large animal alone. Finally, under Old Huo's proposal, seven or eight households jointly hitched such an ox. Even so, it wasn't enough, and they applied for a part of the loan.

"Care for it more meticulously than ancestors." The old lady said, "Just counting on it to give birth to a calf to pay back the loan."

Hearing this situation, I felt pained. I didn't expect the farmers here to be still so poor! It couldn't compare at all with the several advanced villages I had visited. The gap between villages has already opened up.

Because it was still within the New Year holidays, work stopped after four o'clock in the afternoon. I returned to the village with everyone. Tankou Village is also a standard village built uniformly by the Senate to resettle refugees. Houses and streets are very neat, but the cleanliness level is unsatisfactory. Some farm households let pigs run wildly on the streets to find food, which is not only unhygienic but also easy to spread diseases.

I talked with Old Huo about the villagers' living conditions: land yield here is on the low side. The village generally still has two meals a day, solid in the morning and liquid in the evening. During the busy farming season, it changes to two solid and one liquid. The total grain consumption is similar to other relatively good villages, but the proportion of fine grain is even smaller, and even the proportion of miscellaneous grain has dropped—Old Huo reflected that there form quite a few farm households in the village who frequently consume pumpkins as "melon and vegetable substitutes." I wanted to know how much grain reserves the farmers had, so I walked into the village's collective granary, but unexpectedly saw a brand new small steam water pump inside. Asking Old Huo, Old Huo said this was used to support the irrigation system for dry fields on high ground.

Following the vine to get the melon, I followed him to the north end of the village. The terrain here is high, but the land is very level. Old Huo said this piece of land has an area of more than 200 mu. The land has been leveled, and the pipes connecting to the irrigation canal under the hillside are also neat and intact. Even the floor for installing the water pump has been built, but no traces of use can be seen. I asked: "Why not install the water pump?" The accompanying village cadre looked around: "We don't know how."

Later, Old Huo told me that after this Qiongshan Agricultural Demonstration Red Flag "Divert Water Uphill" project was built, it has never been used because installing a steam water pump is skilled work, and users also need to undergo training before taking the post. But Qiongshan doesn't have a master who knows how to install this; they have to wait for Lingao to transfer one to install it.

"This wait has been several months, and don't know when they will come to install it."

Standing on the cement base of the water pump, I saw a water conservancy project by the Nandu River that seemed not to have been put into use either.

"That is the 'Thousand Women Embankment.' Last year the county organized a thousand immigrant women to build it. Even the central government sent people, reporting in newspapers and making propaganda. But in the spring the canal broke, and the supporting sluice gates and such didn't arrive either. The Heaven and Earth Society made an application for material allocation, but the superior hasn't approved it yet. Without cement to repair, without sluice gates, we can't use the water even if there is water!" Old Huo's mood of sighing at the water was expressed in his words and expression.

The awkward situations of "Divert Water Uphill" and "Thousand Women Embankment" exposed a blind spot in our work. Project construction must solve the problems of supporting facilities, usage, and management well; otherwise, it is laboring the people and wasting wealth.

Although Qiongshan is a rare major agricultural county in Hainan, problems of engineering water shortage and poor utilization of water conservancy projects exist simultaneously. This is a common problem. Implementing the Senate's agricultural spirit requires not only increasing investment in construction projects but also improving and perfecting management systems and mechanisms.

Coming back from the fields, it was already more than 1 pm. The village head's woman had boiled sweet potato porridge in the kitchen and fried a pancake flower with oil, salt, and chopped green onion. Working in the morning, walking a lot on paddy field roads, plus having no dishes, I drank two bowls of sweet potato porridge and ate a large bowl of pancake flower but still didn't feel full, so I ate two more local eggs in succession. No one accompanied the meal, and there were no polite formulas; lunch took only more than 10 minutes. In contrast, on some official activity occasions, eating became a burden wasting time and money. Actually, this burden is "uncomfortable at both ends." Changing the method of official reception can be very simple: first, don't want people to accompany; second, firmly implement the principle of paying from one's own pocket. Achieving these two points, the "chronic illness of eating and drinking" can be solved easily.

After the meal, I came to the village office. The main cadres of the village all came. The militia captain had served as a soldier in Shandong and returned after being discharged due to old age. Honest and sincere yet not lacking shrewdness, he also spoke the new language [Mandarin] quite well. The accountant is a young man cultivated by ourselves. The ledgers here are incomplete. At my request, Old Huo found several books of materials from the cabinet: records of village cadre meetings, Heaven and Earth Society work registration, and records of Red and White Council activities, etc.
