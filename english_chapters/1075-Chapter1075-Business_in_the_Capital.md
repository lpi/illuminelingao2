# Chapter 1075 - Business in the Capital

Wu Kaidi was, after all, someone who had mixed in the Capital with his master for ten years. He had a lot of experience running errands for his master, and through word of mouth among servants, he knew quite a few tricks of corruption and fraud.

"This bunch of eunuchs are all masters who eat people without spitting out bones. If he cheats me of tens of thousands on taels of silver without doing the work, wouldn't we still have to give him the dividends here without a penny less? We are compromising for the general interest here."

He thought for a moment and said: "Is the Master worrying too much? Your relationship with Eunuch Yang is not an ordinary one—how much silver has he deposited in your house alone? Besides, he still holds shares in the house. What benefit does he get from cheating you? Furthermore, if he goes to ask Wang Dehua to do things, he is also sending silver to Wang Dehua, and Wang Dehua has to appreciate his face. Eunuch Yang would wish for such a thing where he can earn outside silver. Otherwise, what does he rely on to curry favor with the higher-ups?"

"That's true!" Leng Ningyun held his forehead. Wu Kaidi made some sense. "But I'm still worried..."

Leng Ningyun had worked in the financial industry for a period in the past and was used to seeing a batch of brokers at the foot of the Capital who pulled tiger skins as a banner, buying and selling on empty air. They could fool hundreds of thousands or millions out of suckers from out of town without doing a thing.

"What the Master says is also true." Wu Kaidi said. "I'll go out and ask around right now. Get you some solid news."

Running out to buy the Capital Gazette/Di Chao was an important schedule for Wu Kaidi every day, then he would go around the doors of various officials and big businesses with connections, chat with the gatekeepers, and listen to the news. A lot of the Capital intelligence collected by Leng Ningyun actually came this way.

"Also about the news of the Dengzhou Mutiny, ask around more," he instructed.

"Yes, I understand."

While Wu Kaidi went to inquire about news, Leng Ningyun moved his numb legs off the heated kang. Rubbing his legs and feet, he walked full of displeasure to a hidden door with a combination lock.

Opening the hidden door, inside was a room without windows on all four sides—the local "Safe House." The area of the safe house was not small—not a tiny room. According to traditional Chinese architectural style, this was a room three bays wide. Rows of large red sandalwood cabinets stood along the walls. In the center was a large painting table. There were a few chairs, and several blackboards stood there.

Leng Ningyun lit the gas lamp on the table, and the whole room instantly became bright.

This place was accessible only to himself, his assistant Wu Kaidi, and his confidential secretary who doubled as a radio operator.

He walked to a large red sandalwood cabinet numbered.

Opening the cabinet door, inside were packed binders: these cabinets collected all intelligence materials on the Capital, ranging from officials of all sizes in various yamen, clerks, owners and managers of major businesses, to the shop assistants, servants, maids, gatekeepers, and cooks below... The list was complete. Key figures also had short biographies. Besides that, there was "black material" on these people—any black material, whether hearsay or factual, Wu Kaidi would report to him in detail every day, and he summarized it into materials and filed them into someone's file.

Things that big shots thought were very secret were known by the lower levels very early; this phenomenon was also very common in the Ming Dynasty. Especially the servants and petty officials around dignitaries were almost born leakers.

Recorded in these notebooks were the results of his days in the Capital.

Intelligence work is first of all gathering enough basic data—and public data is the main source of intelligence. This was the concept Li Yan focused on instilling in him during his training at the Farm.

Actually, this was not a rare concept for Leng Ningyun, who had made a living in the financial industry—the financial industry also had an intelligence collection system. Initially, when he worked in the Key Account Department for a period, the department also had detailed customer files for all key customers, detailed down to the birthdays, hobbies, and even food tastes of wives, children, and even mistresses.

Leng Ningyun was very familiar with the documents in the cabinet. He quickly found the materials on currently popular eunuchs like Wang Dehua, took them out one by one, piled them on the desk, and began to read.

The days of opening a bank in the Capital gave Leng Ningyun the illusion of returning to work in a bank in the past—the biggest feeling was: It's really damn boring.

How was this different from working in the Key Account Department of the bank originally—at least that was in a high-class office building, a 24-hour constant temperature and humidity environment, the restroom was clean, the flush toilet shone, and the air was filled with the scent of jasmine essence.

Since parting with Zhao Yingong in Hangzhou, he had completely said goodbye to direct contact with Senators. Contact with the Senate was limited to a few letters and radio waves. Although conditions in Lingao were tough, life facilities for Senators had greatly improved after years of construction; at least sanitary bath equipment was fully popularized in Bairen City. Here, his most accustomed hygiene method was heating water to bathe every day—Wu Kaidi reminded him more than once: doing so in winter was dangerous: either catching a cold and dying, or dying from "charcoal poison" (carbon monoxide poisoning) while burning a charcoal basin to keep warm during the bath. After catching a cold and fever once after a bath, he had to reduce bathing to once a week. Fortunately, there was paper for wiping butts sold in the Capital—called "Dou'er Paper," a kind of rough straw paper. It was passable after being meticulously processed by the local maid he bought: spraying water first, then ironing with a charcoal iron made it much softer.

Leng Ningyun occasionally regretted applying to come to Beijing. Initially, because he was just a face in the crowd in the Senate, he boldly applied with a faint thought of making contributions and establishing a career, and it was actually approved. Leng Ningyun would often shamefully recall how he emptied his clip in one breath, dropped his rifle, and fled during the battle defending the camp against Huang Shoutong. Because Wang Luobin saw this, it became a huge "stain" on him. He always wanted to wash himself clean through some heroic action.

When he left Lingao to organize his backpack, picking up that Glock pistol brought a bit of self-mockery: What's the use of carrying this pistol? Once something happens, counting on the Foreign Intelligence Bureau to rescue is absolutely too late; he could at most use this modern weapon to end his own life.

After arriving in Beijing, the difficulties of the work far exceeded his imagination. Although he received comprehensive training at "The Farm" and the Historical Data Research Group of the Grand Library specifically crammed him with information on Capital officials and concepts of political struggle, these things were of no use when he really started working in Beijing: High-ranking officials disdained meeting a small merchant like him. Whether you were the Bill Gates or Buffett of the Ming Dynasty, in the eyes of scholar-officials, you were just a tool for amassing wealth.

More importantly, coming to Beijing, he took Eunuch Yang's route. His business also had Eunuch Yang's background. Many scholar-officials were very dismissive of this. There was also resistance to carrying out work. Privately, Leng Ningyun had heard Senators mock that he only did two things in Beijing: kowtowing and giving money.

The problem was, for some people, even if you wanted to give them money, there was nowhere to give it. Leng Ningyun thought, *bribery is a profound branch of learning*.

According to Leng Ningyun's original plan, his two main blocks of work in Beijing were: contacting high-level officials, expanding the intelligence network and connections; establishing Delong Bank outlets and expanding financial influence to achieve profitability.

For the first task, Leng Ningyun felt he had somewhat failed the trust of the Foreign Intelligence Bureau. Although River Mountain (Jiang Shan) didn't have high expectations for his activity ability, he hadn't made any progress worth mentioning in activities to approach high-level officials. Obviously, using merely Eunuch Yang's route was not enough; they urgently needed new high-level figures with enough influence to broaden the social network.

On the other aspect, Delong Bank had opened smoothly. The current Delong Bank Beijing Branch, named a branch, was actually also the Senate's communication station and intelligence point in Beijing. The opening of the bank was established entirely according to the standard system of Delong Bank branches everywhere. Leng Ningyun considered himself conscientious in his professional field. Relying on Delong's existing influence in Guangdong and the Jiangnan region, the remittance business handled since opening had seen substantial development: Delong-issued drafts could previously only be cashed at Li Luoyou's Liaohai Firm in the Capital. Not only was the discount rate relatively high, but there was also a certain quota for cashing each month, causing many inconveniences. Since Delong opened, remittances from the direction of Liangguang (Guangdong/Guangxi) had basically been monopolized by Delong, and remittance business in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang area was also flourishing.

Because of the expansion of the remittance business, deposits increased substantially. In Leng Ningyun's ledger, the recent daily turnover was over one hundred thousand taels. Fixed-term deposit business with fixed interest was also carried out in small amounts. But the loan business, which was crucial for a bank, had not unfolded much up to now.

From a certain perspective, lending was a very profitable financial activity in 17th-century Beijing City of the Great Ming: First, there was no limited liability in this spacetime; it was all unlimited liability. Second, the interest rates here were outrageously high, calculated by the month, and annual interest lower than thirty percent was considered charity.

Moreover, the demand for loans here was not small. Whether it was various merchants doing big business here, or failed scholars and dismissed officials scrambling and drilling for a half-official position here, they all had great demand for loans.

In the recent few months, he had only issued one large loan: five hundred taels of silver. The project was lending to a Mongol goods merchant going to Mongolia to purchase brick tea and groceries.

The business was introduced by the Qipwei Escort Agency Capital Head Office. Merchants took brick tea to Mongolia, exchanged it for furs, horses, and cattle, and brought them back inside the pass. The profit from Mongolian trade was very considerable, up to several hundred percent at a time. Leng Ningyun felt this risk was worth taking. Even so, he still worried about this large loan of his: he actually knew very little about risk control in the Ming Dynasty, but he felt this step had to be taken sooner or later: Everything has a beginning.
