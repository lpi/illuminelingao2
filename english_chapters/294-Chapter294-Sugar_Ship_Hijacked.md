# Chapter 294: Sweet Port Turbulence — Sugar Ship Hijacked

Pei Lixiu came to serve dishes again. "This is foie gras pate," she said. "This wine was sent by Young Master Wu. Regarding their matter, Master, why don't you trouble yourself to plan something for them?" Saying this, she cast a flirtatious glance, and while serving the wine, leaned half her body against Guo Yi.

Wu and Dong saw this and couldn't help but be overjoyed. They didn't expect Miss Pei to be willing to put in so much effort; she was indeed a person of her word! With her taking the lead, there was an eighty percent chance this matter would work out!

Half of Guo Yi's body, however, had already gone numb. Although he knew it was acting, he was complaining incessantly in his heart. He still had to put on an appearance of enjoyment and said, "Easy to discuss! Easy to discuss. Since you two value me, brother, I naturally have to plan well for you two."

"We are troubling you! Thank you!"

Guo Yi said to the two, "I have a question to ask."

"Good, good. Please speak."

"Since you two think highly of me, I dare not be ungrateful. But first, I want to ask how much money there is. To use this money, there must always be a plan. Is the capital to be returned in one or two months, or is a year or half a year also fine? How much return do you want? There must be a general idea first so I can start."

Wu Zhixiang looked at Dong Jizhong, seeking his opinion with his eyes.

"Brother Ziyan," Dong Jizhong said, "There isn't much silver. I have 50,000, and Brother Wu has over 30,000. Together, it's just a figure of 80,000 or 90,000. Silver is inconvenient to leave sitting for long; it must be turned over quickly."

Nearly 100,000 silver, yet they said the amount wasn't large; what a lavish tone. The wealth of officialdom was truly appalling. Guo Yi thought, no wonder the Ming Dynasty was going to perish.

He nodded. "I understand your thoughts. Originally, this is no big deal. But for merchants, trust and righteousness are most important. Now, all Australian goods produced by Purple Treasure Pavilion are exclusively sold by Master Gao. It is inconvenient for me to go back on my word and distribute goods to you two without authorization. Otherwise, in this marketplace, my, Guo's, credit would be gone."

"This, we still ask Brother Ziyan to help!" Wu Zhixiang quickly pleaded.

Help? Why should I help you? Guo Yi thought to himself that dandies were dandies; they didn't even know these basic worldly wisdoms. However, although dandies were ignorant of worldly wisdom, they had money. Now, to use their money, the so-called "help" was also bringing help to himself.

"I have another way to get rich. I wonder if you two are interested?"

"We wish to hear the details!" The two immediately became interested.

"Do you two know about sugar?"

"We know, we know," Dong Jizhong nodded repeatedly. "Sugar is a big business!" Although he didn't do maritime trade, he had been influenced by what he saw and heard in Guangzhou and knew that sugar was an extremely easy-to-sell foreign trade good; both the East and West Oceans were scrambling for it.

"In Australia, sugar also sells very well. Therefore, in the recent month or two, I will be collecting sugar in Guangdong. Once the sugar is collected, loaded onto ships, and transported back, it will be silver. Are you two interested in investing a share in it?"

He didn't say borrow; firstly, the interest to be paid for borrowing was extremely high, and secondly, they had just said they had great concerns about usury, so he only said he invited them to participate with a share.

Wu Zhixiang said without thinking, "Good, good. I just don't know what the return is?"

"It's hard to say, but according to the annual convention, for every tael of silver invested, a return of 2% is always there."

"How long will it take? It won't do if the time delay is too long." Dong Jizhong interrupted.

Guo Yi nodded. "Of course! If it takes a year or half a year to get the capital and interest back, you two should just deposit it directly at the counter of a large business house. My business will see results in three months."

Actually, it wouldn't even take a month. Guo Yi had calculated it himself; a shipload of sugar transported from Xuwen to Guangzhou could be sold off in as fast as ten days. Paying a total of 2% interest over three months was a heavy interest rate, but compared to the interest for borrowing, it was much lower. Moreover, in these three months, the money could change hands one or two more times, equivalent to using it three times over.

Having his mind read, Dong Jizhong's face flushed slightly, and he busily said, "That's not what I meant! Brother Ziyan is helping us brothers so much! How could brothers dare to haggle over more or less? It's just that there are some inconveniences involved..." To show he wasn't talking nonsense, he awkwardly revealed a bit of news, saying that part of this silver was "temporarily borrowed public funds" and couldn't be kept in hand for long. Guo Yi thought, how much public funds could a Vice General father have? This money was probably soldier's pay.

"It's fine, it's fine, we are all brothers!" Guo Yi put on the appearance of a good friend, "Come, come, drink!"

"Since it is settled, I wonder where the silver should be sent for collection?" Dong Jizhong was anxious to finalize the matter. "I will write a note immediately and tell someone to go back and withdraw it and send it to your residence immediately..."

"No need," Guo Yi said decisively. "Since we are partners, the first priority is credit, and the second is procedure. When the time comes for your funds, I will have people from the Qiwei Escort Agency come to collect them. You two just need to instruct your doormen and accountants. I will instruct Purple Treasure Pavilion to issue a passbook for you, noting three months and calculating interest at 2%. If the market is good, a bonus will be presented according to the share capital. Is this acceptable?"

"Acceptable, acceptable!" These words made the two nod repeatedly, feeling that Proprietor Guo spoke and acted beautifully and reliably. They felt a few points more closeness towards him. Once the major event was settled, the mood naturally relaxed, and the subsequent drinking went smoother and smoother. Guo Yi also took the opportunity to inquire about a lot of official news.

What he was most concerned about was, naturally, Guangdong's attitude towards Lingao. In Guangdong's official circles, the movements of Liu Xiang, Zhu Cailao, and others attracted far more attention than Lingao. Dong Jizhong hadn't even heard of such a thing—Lingao had reported bandit situations, but in these years, prefectures and counties reporting bandits were as numerous as ox hairs. Lingao County seat was still in the hands of the government, so naturally, no one cared.

As for inside Beijing city, Chongzhen was still too busy "bringing order out of chaos" and cleaning up the remnants of Wei Zhongxian's clique—he had recently reprimanded the cabinet ministers for the third time for being ineffective in liquidating the "traitorous party." Seeing that this year's "Capital Inspection" in both the Southern and Northern capitals would inevitably involve major actions to clear out the "traitorous party" of Wei Zhongxian, the atmosphere in officialdom was quite tense. The officials who were originally anti-Wei naturally wanted to take advantage of the momentum to rise; those who had secretly colluded had to consider how to make connections in various ways to exonerate themselves, preferably keeping their official positions; the fence-sitters wanted to curry favor with the new dignitaries of the current dynasty to advance further... The entire court and officialdom were buzzing like a swarm of bees, with no peace.

This was generally consistent with the news Guo Yi had obtained from the court gazettes. Since no one in either Beijing or Guangdong was paying attention, Lingao's construction could still obtain a relatively stable buffer period. This news had to be notified to the Executive Committee as soon as possible.

The drinking lasted until three in the afternoon before they dispersed happily. Guo Yi explained a few important words to Pei Lixiu, especially asking her to pay attention to whether anyone coming to Purple Clarity Pavilion recently mentioned sugar. If there was important news, send someone to report it in time.

The Transmigration Group's control over Leizhou sugar versus the Haiyi Guild was bound to determine a winner. According to Guo Yi's view, no matter how strong the Haiyi Guild was, it couldn't fight the strong dragon of the Transmigration Group. Even without using the Executive Committee's special forces, just relying on the operations here in Guangzhou, the Haiyi Guild would undoubtedly lose in this sugar collection war—after successfully pulling two loans today, he became even more firm in this belief.

Now, regarding funds, the Transmigration Group was already holding the winning ticket. I'm afraid the Haiyi Guild wouldn't expect the transmigrators to have the ability to get over 100,000 taels of silver so quickly. In the next few days, there should be more funds that could be mobilized—Pei Lixiu said that besides Wu and Dong, there were several other young masters from similar official families. He didn't dare say too much, but mobilizing another 40,000 or 50,000 silver shouldn't be a problem. The figure of 200,000 taels was enough to beat the Haiyi Guild until they couldn't get up.

China has always been called a black hole for silver, and Guangzhou is probably the place that hoards the most silver. They say money is tight, but actually, there are plenty of people with large amounts of cash in hand! It's just a matter of figuring out how to dig it all out of them.

In the past, he only felt that the Transmigration Group had the Gao family line, so money was not a problem at all. However, trying his hand in the sugar industry this time, he discovered that he was still far from the four words "abundant money supply." In the long run, raising funds from multiple sources was the important thing. All the way, he was racking his brains on how to raise more funds and expand the business further.

While contemplating in the sedan chair, the sedan chair suddenly stopped, and a follower reported, "Master, someone from Shopkeeper Sun of Qiwei has come to pay respects, asking you to go to the escort agency immediately."

"What is it?" Guo Yi asked, then realized he was rash. The comer was just a messenger; what could he know? Shopkeeper Sun most likely had important news and had to report it in person. Not finding him at Huifu Street, and knowing he had gone to Purple Clarity Pavilion, he sent someone to look for him on the way.

"Go to Qiwei!"

Once the sedan curtain was lowered, they immediately went in the direction of the Qiwei Escort Agency. His heart was a bit anxious. Although he was ninety-nine percent sure about the Leizhou matter this time, the closer it got to the final moment, the less likely problems could occur. The key to this battle was the sugar price in Guangzhou. According to recent market trends, the price was climbing steadily and had reached 3.92 taels. He already knew from the South China side that according to locals, Leizhou's sugar production this year was "average," meaning a standard level. However, Leizhou was not the only place in China that produced sugar; Fujian, close at hand, also produced sugar. He still knew nothing about the local market there. If a large batch of sugar arrived and the price fell, the large sum of high-interest borrowed funds would turn into a dose of poison!

At this critical juncture, unexpected accidents were feared the most. Guo Yi had already instructed Sun Kecheng that the various branches and external counters should report every three days recently. If they encountered sugar goods passing through, they should try to find out the origin and production volume of the sugar, and where it was planned to be transported and sold. Instruct escort masters to visit tea houses more often, just to obtain useful news in these places—even a few words were sometimes extremely critical.

The sedan chair arrived at Qiwei. Instead of entering the main gate—he was a shareholder here and a close friend of the shopkeeper, coming once every three to five days, a guest familiar beyond familiarity—the sedan chair went straight in through the side door and simply stopped by the flower hall.

Sun Kecheng was already waiting under the dripping eaves. This wasn't politeness, but because the matter was urgent, and he had to tell Guo Yi quickly.

"Proprietor Guo, something happened!"

These words came down like a blow to the face, clearly indicating the urgency of the matter. Guo Yi nodded, "Speak inside."

Only then did Sun Kecheng realize that talking in the courtyard was inappropriate, and quickly ushered him into the flower hall and into a side chamber. This was where they discussed matters in secret.

"Yesterday, a sugar ship was hijacked at sea!"

Guo Yi felt a tightness in his heart. Could it be the *Dengyingzhou*? That ship was a precious darling. On second thought, the *Dengyingzhou* had brought a shipload of sugar from Leizhou, and had just loaded bituminous coal and left for Lingao the day before yesterday. It should still be on the way now, so it couldn't be it no matter what.

"It's the *Guang Bing*!"

The *Guang Bing* was a double-masted Guangdong ship with a capacity of over 100 tons. It was a vessel belonging to the Gaodi Shipyard dedicated to coastal freight.

The so-called Gaodi Shipyard was a freight shipping company jointly run by the Guangzhou Station and the Qiwei Escort Agency to make up for Lingao's shipping shortage. All used were small coastal cargo ships purchased locally, and the sailors were also hired locally. The shipping company was managed by the Guangzhou Station and did not belong to the jurisdiction of the Maritime Power Department. The only business was running the Lingao-Guangzhou route.

Because business was busy, the fleet expanded quickly. Now it already possessed six double-masted ships, named starting with 'Guang' and ordered by Heavenly Stems, from *Guang Jia* all the way to *Guang Geng*. They bore more than half of the task of transporting various materials to Lingao.

Originally, Gaodi ships mostly returned from Lingao empty—the so-called "Australian goods" were small in quantity and high in value, so for safety reasons, they were always transported by the Maritime Power Department's *Dengyingzhou*. Right now, the South China Factory had a backlog of granulated sugar, and Guangzhou was also anxious to recoup funds. After discussion, both sides decided to use the empty ships of the Gaodi Shipyard returning from Lingao to load granulated sugar on the way back. It was a convenient and profitable thing; who knew such a thing would happen!

Because the sea surface was not peaceful, although there were no cannons on the shipyard's ships, sailors were equipped with swords, spears, and matchlock guns for self-defense, and special escort masters for sea routes were assigned to hold the line. The route basically didn't go into the outer ocean, only sailing in the inner ocean. Although the journey was slightly longer this way, it was safer. So the ships ran for several months without any incidents—how did an accident happen as soon as sugar was loaded?

"What exactly happened? Tell me the process."

Sun Kecheng whispered, "The ship came back, but five people died."

"Can the ship still be used?" After asking this, he couldn't help regretting it. Asking about the ship's condition before the casualties of subordinates was a bit too chilling. He hurriedly added a sentence, "Are there any wounded?"

"The ship is at the dock, looking for someone for repairs. There is some minor damage, but no major obstruction!" Sun Kecheng said. "The sailors are all resting at Gaodi Inn. Some are injured and doctors are being called!"

"Is the ship captain alright? What about the escort masters?"

"I heard they were injured, but it's not serious. But two escort masters died!" Sun Kecheng looked gloomy. "They were old brothers who had worked together for many years. I didn't expect such a thing to happen!"

Although death in the escort agency was not rare, these two were old hands who had worked together for years. Naturally, the sentiment was different from the new recruits recently.

"People cannot be brought back to life. I will definitely provide generous compensation here!" Guo Yi quickly patted his chest. "First send 200 taels of silver as a condolence gift to each of the bereaved families. As for the compensation matters, you watch over it for me first, and we'll discuss it together later—don't be afraid to spend money!"
