# Chapter 2495: Burning the Building (Part 4)

The carriage started quickly. Not long after, it arrived at the intersection. Scout No. 1 was following on foot, already panting a bit from hurrying. Seeing the carriage arrive, he immediately hopped onto the side of the carriage. People were coming and going on the road, making it inconvenient for the large carriage Qiaoyan rode in to travel. Before long, Yang Cao's carriage caught up by taking a shortcut. After following for a distance, Yang Cao slightly lifted the curtain to look forward. She saw that the carriage ahead did not look as steady as before; the carriage body swayed left and right lightly, obviously carrying a light load. Looking at the wheel ruts, they were also very shallow. Yang Cao immediately felt something was wrong and whispered: "Go, see if there is anyone in the carriage."

Scout No. 1 immediately jumped off the carriage and walked quickly over. He rubbed his body against the front shaft of the carriage and fell down immediately, shouting: "Ah, the carriage hit someone!"

The driver was startled and immediately reined in the carriage, saying: "You, you bumped into it yourself; what does it have to do with me!"

Scout No. 1 immediately got up and grabbed the horse's bridle, saying: "Want to leave after hitting someone? Is there such reason!" As he spoke, he got on the carriage to pull and drag the driver. Taking the opportunity, he bumped his body and seemingly unintentionally hooked the carriage curtain with his arm, lifting it. To his shock, he found the carriage empty.

The scout immediately took out his ID and flashed it, asking the driver sternly with a fierce look: "Where is the person in the carriage? I am from the Yamen. You must speak truthfully, or be careful of a lawsuit!"

The driver was at a loss and didn't know who the person in front of him was. Seeing his fierce face, he was afraid and didn't dare to provoke him. He couldn't help saying: "I, I don't know. That, that person gave double tip as soon as he got on the carriage, only saying to deliver a letter to Three Immortals Terrace. On the way, the carriage curtain and window curtains must be hung well and cannot be opened. He said if the letter isn't delivered, he'll make me pay double. After saying this, at the corner of the last intersection where tree shade covered the view, he didn't even call to stop and jumped directly off the carriage and left." Saying this, he took out an envelope.

Scout No. 1 grabbed the envelope and opened it. Sure enough, it was a piece of white paper. He wasted no more words with the driver, took the envelope, and reported back immediately. Yang Cao knew instantly upon seeing it that they had fallen for a diversionary tactic and lost the tail. Now that person was the only clue to this matter. Once lost, it would be like a clay ox entering the sea. The tail must be recovered as soon as possible. She quickly spread out the regional map marking the surrounding streets, exits, and paths of the surveillance area in the carriage. Her eyes wandered nervously over the map, while her mind thought rapidly. *Not going out of the city, walking—this indicates their stronghold is inside the city or at least they have a foothold inside the city. The location where he got off shouldn't be where the stronghold is; otherwise, a little analysis would expose it. The driver said he got off at the previous intersection, indicating Yang Cao and her team discovered it quite timely. The target shouldn't have gone far. Calculated by time, it shouldn't exceed half a street. There is still a possibility of recovering the tail.* Thinking of this, Yang Cao quickly circled several possible locations and paths where the target might appear on the map with a red pencil, then pulled open the bottom box of the carriage, took out the eight-power binoculars, handed the map and binoculars to Scout No. 2 sitting diagonally on the carriage side in front, and said: "Commanding height, search and observe." Scout No. 2 took the items and nodded.

The driver scanned the surroundings and stopped the carriage along a high wall by the roadside. With binoculars in hand, Scout No. 2 stepped on the carriage roof and leaped onto the top of the wall in just two steps, then climbed up a big tree with the help of the wall. Straddling a tree fork, he covered the binoculars with a cloth and searched among the streets and alleys, quickly comparing the target's physical characteristics with the few points marked on the map.

Time passed second by second. Yang Cao took out her pocket watch and looked at it. Fine cold sweat began to slowly seep from her forehead. The eyes of the three people under the tree also gradually became more and more anxious. Suddenly, Scout No. 2's binoculars stopped swinging abruptly. He fixed on a spot for a moment, held the binoculars with his left hand, pointed to the west with his right hand, and then quickly made a few one-armed hand signals downward. Yang Cao immediately looked down at the map and said: "Target moving from west to east. He is taking Route Wu."

At this time, Scout No. 2 swung his leg, propped his hands and feet on the trunk twice, and jumped down straight from the tree. As soon as he landed, Yang Cao immediately said to him: "You have the best physical stamina. Go on foot via Route Bing to intersperse. Route Geng is wide; the carriage takes Route Geng. Action." Immediately, the driver shouted: "Giddyap!" The carriage galloped straight through from the diagonal street according to the planned route, while Scout No. 2 flew via a shortcut from another narrow alley.

Yang Cao's carriage circled around the perimeter and slowed down on a straight road ahead of Qiaoyan, dropping off Scout No. 1. Scout No. 2 had just come out of the narrow alley entrance, still some distance from the target. Scout No. 1 calmly said to a newsboy by the road: "A daily paper." Saying this, he took out a coin from his chest pocket and threw it over. Scouts always carried a handful of small change to be ready to pay bills without needing change.

Scout No. 1 stood quietly by the roadside holding the newspaper, observing silently with eyes over the top edge of the newspaper. Shortly, Qiaoyan walked past Scout No. 1. Only after he had passed six or seven meters did Scout No. 1 calmly put away the newspaper and follow slowly. At this time, Scout No. 2 had also recovered from the heavy panting of running fast and slowly followed behind Scout No. 1. Still following the order of No. 1 as main tail and No. 2 as vice tail, they resumed positions. Yang Cao's position changed slightly, falling slightly behind Scout No. 2. Although Guangzhou had been liberated, there were still not many women showing their faces in public. A woman appearing repeatedly would be more conspicuous and easier to expose, so generally, male scouts were arranged as main tails, and women often served as mobile substitutes.

Yang Cao followed behind Scout No. 2. After passing another intersection, she suddenly keenly perceived that the eyes of a beggar by the road were somewhat strange. Although the beggar held a bowl with jagged edges and shook it constantly to beg for food, his gaze patrolled constantly ten meters behind Qiaoyan. Yang Cao's heart skipped a beat: *The target has someone meeting him.*

She walked quickly forward, successively overtaking Scouts No. 1 and No. 2. She touched her waist with her hand, alerting Scout No. 1 that the target had support personnel. Scout No. 1 signaled receipt with his eyes, then immediately put his hands behind his back to send information to No. 2 behind. Scouts No. 1 and No. 2 immediately exchanged tail positions to confuse the support personnel, while Yang Cao slowed her pace and fell behind, searching for the beggar's figure.

Sure enough, the beggar quietly followed in the crowd. At this time, Qiaoyan ahead suddenly turned sharply into a small alley nearby, then pressed his body tightly against the alley wall on the back street to peek backward. Scout No. 2, having swapped positions, did not follow into the small alley. Instead, he looked straight ahead, pacing slowly, walking straight past the alley entrance and striding away. Scout No. 1 calmly stopped, sat down at a tea stall by the road, ordered a cup of tea and two pieces of dim sum, and calmly drank slowly while browsing the newspaper. Yang Cao turned into a fabric shop by the road, casually picking through fabrics, chatting idly with the shop assistant, while her gaze monitored secretly through the main door.

Qiaoyan's gaze stared at the back of the receding Scout No. 2. Only after a good while did he withdraw his gaze, then cast his eyes toward the beggar in the crowd. The beggar shook his head gently. Qiaoyan's heart instantly relaxed, and he let out a long breath. Waiting a moment longer and seeing nothing strange, he hesitated no more, flashed out of the alley entrance, and walked quickly forward.

Yang Cao walked out of the fabric shop and switched to the main tail position. Scout No. 1 followed behind her. The two trailed Qiaoyan silently, like an invisible wake. Scout No. 2 turned his reversible outer robe inside out, put on a melon-skin cap, stuck a plaster on his face, slouched his shoulders, leaned against the wall at the street intersection ahead dozing off, and waited silently for the target's appearance. Everything gradually slid into track.

Half an hour later, Qiaoyan stood in front of a large courtyard gate. He knocked on the courtyard gate lightly with three short and two long taps, looking around vigilantly at the same time. Not long after, the courtyard gate opened. Qiaoyan flashed inside the door. The courtyard gate clattered and closed tightly.

Outside the gate, at the street intersection, people came and went, bustling with activity, without a trace of the loneliness of dusk. The slanting glow of the setting sun lazily sprinkled on Yang Cao's shoulder. Yang Cao lit a lady's "Holy Ship" with a hint of fatigue, held it lazily with her right hand, gracefully blew out a smoke ring, and whispered: "Going home, so nice."

Back at the bureau, Yang Cao organized all the materials at hand and began to sort them out. To be honest, there were simply too many materials in front of her, with thousands of threads and loose ends. The data retrieval system established by the Calculation Center in Guangzhou helped them a lot, allowing them to query various related materials at any time using the "keyword" mode, but this mechanical retrieval still required a lot of manpower for organization and analysis.

Although related card systems were made, at a glance, there were several hundred index cards of all kinds. This relied heavily on the brainpower of the responsible officials.

Yang Cao realized that the existence of the Martial Team qualitatively changed the whole case. In the past, they only suspected the existence of a "Martial Team," but judging from this tracking, this team not only existed but was also very careful. She recalled the counterfeit currency case which had recently shown a trend of intensifying, and the clue of the mysterious drug silver ingot "Sanjiangmao" notified by Police Section 9.

What did they want to do by gathering together? Obviously, collecting "Baldy Intelligence" was only a part; otherwise, it couldn't explain why they spent money to maintain some "Martial Team." Yang Cao was very clear about the cost of maintaining armed forces; it was far from comparable to hiring a few scholars to copy and write. A team of several hundred people gathering together—people eating and horses chewing—just the daily cost of food and firewood was a huge expense, let alone the monthly pay.

The expense of maintaining private soldiers for a long time was something even a wealthy and powerful family like the Liang family couldn't bear. The Loyalty Battalion in Foshan was maintained by joint funding from all the big households in the fort.

It was obvious that the Liang family was not alone. There might be quite a few local noble families and big households secretly colluding with him. It's just that these big households either didn't live in Guangzhou or the main family members were all in the countryside. The Senate's limited powerful units still couldn't monitor their abnormalities.

Thinking of this, Yang Cao's hair stood on end. Under the Ming rule, it might be pardonable for these big households to join forces to maintain militia and village braves. What did they intend to use them for now?
