# Chapter 2007 - The Jiliang Institute

However, most women had no home to return to. Women sent to Qingjie Hall, whether willingly or by force, either came from impoverished families with one less mouth to feed, or had relatives fighting over inheritances who feared orphans and widows would claim too large a share. Those who genuinely wished to maintain their chaste widowhood out of conviction were perhaps one or two in a hundred.

Now that Qingjie Hall had been dissolved, for them it actually meant losing their livelihood. When the dissolution of Qingjie Hall was announced and everyone could go home, not only did most people "refuse to comply at all costs," but it nearly caused fatalities, almost turning this "benevolent policy" into an embarrassment.

Later, Liu San came specially to hold several discussion meetings and roughly understood that the widows' reluctance to leave wasn't because of "maintaining chastity" but due to livelihood concerns. So the final decision was to organize "production for self-rescue" at the shelter, with further arrangements to be made gradually later.

"I want to see Qingjie Hall," Du Yibin said directly. "And the Jiliang Institute."

The Director and Deputy Director exchanged glances: this Elder comes in asking to see nothing else, not asking about anything else—just wants to look at women. What's his angle?

However, since he was an Elder conducting an inspection, wherever he wanted to go was naturally up to him. Lu Weijia quickly said: "That's easy to arrange."

The "chaste widows" still lived in the former Qingjie Hall buildings. Because women from similar institutions across the province had been added, the original buildings weren't enough, so some additional quarters had been repaired and built. The dormitories were equipped with bunk beds and necessary washing facilities. Women with young children were given separate rooms. The originally filthy environment had been cleaned up, and public toilets had been specially built. Both the surrounding environment and living conditions had greatly improved.

The "chaste widows" were no longer locked away in small courtyards like before. They could move freely within the shelter grounds. Previously, spinning and weaving in dark rooms had been their only work. Now some served as "childcare workers" or "attendants" within the shelter, while others handled "outsourced processing"—mainly sewing various uniforms and making shoe uppers.

The work wasn't light, but the working environment was brighter and more hygienic than before. With adequate food and rest, these women who had become pale and emaciated from long-term malnutrition and confinement had regained healthy complexions, and their previously skeletal bodies had filled out.

Though the shelter's rules were strict, they couldn't withstand the power of hormones. So when Du Yibin arrived and talked with the person in charge, he realized he'd come a step late. The naturalized personnel working at the shelter had already used their positions to "personally benefit" by getting together with quite a few "chaste widows." He was told several couples had even "registered."

"Really?!" Du Yibin's head immediately began to ache. So what am I even doing here?

"Yes, about seven or eight couples." Lu Weijia, seeing his expression turn sour, quickly added, "This was approved by the Civil Affairs department—they said it was to solve naturalized citizens' marriage problems..."

"He solves some, you solve some—how am I supposed to solve any?" Du Yibin was quite displeased, feeling they'd stolen his thunder. But Mao Xiuyu misunderstood his meaning, thinking this Elder had come to Qingjie Hall to "select beauties." He sidled up and said: "What's so good about these widows? Most are half-old ladies in their thirties and forties..."

Du Yibin was already annoyed, and this tangent made him even more irritated. He scolded: "What do you know!"

Mao Xiuyu was startled and quickly shut his mouth.

"How many 'chaste widows' do you have here now?"

"Elder, a document came recently saying we shouldn't call them 'chaste widows' anymore..." Lu Weijia said carefully.

"Oh, right, right," Du Yibin slapped his forehead. "So how many widows are there?"

Lu Weijia didn't dare correct the Elder's terminology—the official term was "single women"—and said: "Currently three hundred and nine, of whom twenty-three have young children with them. Besides locals, there are also those sent from other prefectures."

"Ages?"

The age composition was relatively favorable. Only about forty were over fifty—life in Qingjie Hall was hard and exhausting, and widows often didn't live long. Of all age groups, those between thirty and forty were the highest proportion.

This situation was quite different from what he'd imagined, but over three hundred people wasn't a small number. Even if half truly wanted to maintain their widowhood, the rest could still solve over a hundred naturalized citizens' marriage problems.

The two Directors watched his expression alternate between cloudy and clear, occasionally muttering to himself, not knowing what had gotten into this Elder. After a while, he finally said: "Let's go—to the Jiliang Institute. To see the prostitutes."

"Elder, you're not going to look at Qingjie Hall anymore..."

"We'll talk about it later!"

The two didn't dare disobey and had no choice but to take him to the Jiliang Institute.

The Jiliang Institute was set up in what had been a desolate and terrifying back garden. The human remains left there had been cleared away, and several groups of temporary shed-buildings had been erected. The damaged walls had also been patched with bamboo fencing, and Police Volunteer guard posts had been set up on the perimeter—though security outside the city had somewhat improved, there was still sporadic bandit activity, with robberies, murders, and thefts occurring occasionally at night.

Lower-class prostitutes had complex social connections, having interacted with people from all walks of life. To facilitate education and prevent accidents, this area was completely closed-off. Students could only move around within the Jiliang Institute grounds.

"Elder!"

Seeing them arrive, a young female naturalized cadre came forward.

"You are..."

"My name is Lu Cheng. I'm from the Guangzhou Women's Federation, currently in charge of the Jiliang Institute's work."

"Are you married?" Du Yibin suddenly asked.

"What?" Lu Cheng was startled. "N-no..."

"Why aren't you married?"

Lu Cheng had interacted with quite a few Elders but had never encountered one with this manner. She wondered what this Elder wanted—could he have taken a fancy to her? "Busy with work, haven't met the right person..."

"Busy with work is no excuse." Du Yibin thought, clearly there's a single female cadre here while over there they have no wives. "Hurry up and find a cadre or soldier to marry!"

Lu Cheng was bewildered, thinking, what business is it of yours! But her mouth still crisply responded: "Yes! I'll do so as soon as possible!"

Lu Weijia wondered what this Elder's angle was. He came for an inspection but didn't look at what he should look at, didn't ask what he should ask—just fixated on "widows" and "prostitutes." Mao Xiuyu had another thought: could this Elder be here to find maidservants and concubines? But since Elders commanded all under heaven, why would he need to come here? He really couldn't figure it out.

Lu Cheng gave a general introduction to the Jiliang Institute's situation. Currently it housed nearly five hundred prostitutes who had declared during the public morality rectification campaign that they didn't wish to continue in that profession. They came from various counties under Guangzhou Prefecture. These prostitutes were mostly from the lower tiers—sold into prostitution due to family poverty, with most having long lost contact with their families. They were strangers in the local area with no relatives. Because they had been cheap prostitutes, they'd been heavily exploited by madams and pimps, had no savings, and some had various diseases.

"...After arriving here, we helped them go through purification and treated their illnesses. Now production for self-rescue activities are underway..."

"How are these prostitutes doing?"

"The female students' mood is relatively stable." Lu Cheng didn't directly correct the Elder's terminology. "Most of them had very bitter backgrounds and suffered exploitation and abuse in the brothels. Being able to come here, they're all grateful to the Council of Elders."

"Are there any problems?"

The previous words were standard formalities. Lu Cheng had been through Political Security training and knew that what Elders valued most was "existing problems."

"There are some emotional issues. Mainly pessimism about their future lives, and a tendency toward laziness."

The long-term life of prostitution had caused most of them to lose their work ethic, developing lazy, dissolute habits of getting by day to day. So although "production for self-rescue" had been organized for them, their production efficiency didn't even reach half that of the "single women."

"Some people are quite resistant to labor." Lu Cheng grew indignant as she spoke. "Under the madams' and pimps' control, they cowered like quails, not daring to say a word. Once in the Jiliang Institute, each one is like an unchained monkey—sharp-tongued enough to leave you breathless! Seeing that we're kind-hearted, they don't hesitate to break rules..."

It seemed Lu Cheng had taken quite a bit of abuse at the Jiliang Institute. Mao Xiuyu quickly chimed in: "These prosti—students are something else. Each one's a tough customer, thick-skinned! Their backsides are thick-skinned too! When they're punished with the cane for breaking rules, it has no effect at all. After the beating, they pull up their pants still joking: saying how back under the madam they'd knelt on chains and been burned with hot iron chopsticks—these few strokes are just scratching an itch... Truly shameless!"

"They were tortured in the brothels before. Our mild corporal punishment has no deterrent effect on them..." Lu Weijia said. "That's why I say we should focus on education rather than relying on corporal punishment..."

Du Yibin frowned more deeply as he listened. How could women like this become wives for naturalized citizens? For disabled naturalized citizens, there was no point even thinking about it. If things went wrong, they might end up creating "Wu Dalang" situations. This Wang Jun fellow was really unreliable!

He was already inclined to retreat, but they were already at the gate—he'd just declined to visit Qingjie Hall earlier, and backing out again would seem too flighty.

The Police Volunteer guards opened the gate. The leveled ground was covered with white sand and lime, with seven "longhouses" built in rows—bamboo poles and timber for the frame, bamboo strips and reed mats for walls, plastered with a layer of yellow mud and whitewashed. They looked neat and clean enough. Between the longhouses, the gap spaces held rows of clotheslines laden with women's garments—fluttering in the wind like flags of all nations. Though this time period had no triangle panties, bras, or stockings, Du Yibin knew enough to recognize that most were women's intimate garments. He felt slightly embarrassed.

Mao Xiuyu, thinking he found it unlucky, whispered to Lu Cheng: "Director Lu, perhaps you should have them take these down first—unsightly..."

"No need to take them down." Du Yibin heard this and became even more annoyed, scolding: "What's wrong with hanging a few clothes? Making a mountain out of a molehill!"

"Yes, yes, yes." Mao Xiuyu immediately hunched his back, put on an expression of "your humble servant deserves death," and shrank to the back.

Only a handful of "female students" were in the open area—some squatting by the well washing clothes, others dozing in chairs by the longhouse doors. Lu Cheng said most were working in the workshop; these were all on sick leave.
