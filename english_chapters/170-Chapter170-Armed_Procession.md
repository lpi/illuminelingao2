# Chapter 170: Armed Procession

News of the "bald bandits" bivouacking nearby spread to the surrounding villages. Obviously, more than 200 fully armed, artillery-equipped soldiers weren't touring. Before dark, villages within ten *li* sent envoys with wine, dried meat, chickens, and ducks to visit.

"I was about to summon them, and they delivered themselves." Xi Yazhou had an Executive Committee mandate: pacify roadside villages, secure allegiance.

The headquarters tent had a radio installed and a laptop computer displaying Xi Yazhou's beloved wargame—now converted to an operational simulation system. Outside, two soldiers frantically pedaled a dual-person generator.

Xi Yazhou sat on a folding canvas chair before the headquarters tent. Behind him were two flagstaffs flying his favorite red-yellow triangular pennants—his personal command flag. The transmigrator army's official flag remained under debate. Watching the bent-backed elders in their best clothes shuffle toward him through the camp gate... this feeling of power was rather enjoyable.

Through three translators—besides Lingao dialect, some spoke military dialect and some Qiongzhou dialect—Xi Yazhou explained that they were just passing through and would depart at dawn. Gifts were refused. Unexpectedly, this declaration made the elders weep. They knelt, desperately pleading, practically hugging his legs.

"What's happening?" Xi Yazhou was puzzled.

Translator Xiong Buyu was also confused—why did a harmless announcement produce this? After much questioning, it turned out the elders assumed the rejection of gifts meant dissatisfaction—that they were expecting extortion. All were crying about their villages starving to death.

"Fine, accept the wine." Xi Yazhou half-laughed, half-sympathized with the commoners' plight. "Keep dried meat and poultry. Send fresh vegetables and eggs instead."

Hearing Xi Yazhou's request, the elders rose as if pardoned. The villages then jointly presented "Chief Xi" 50 *liang* of silver. Xi Yazhou firmly refused. This earned him praise: "The General is incorruptible," "The Chief is pure and selfless." Xiong Buyu translated a few—then stopped bothering.

Xi Yazhou, his face serious, announced that per Executive Committee policy, all villages must send representatives to Bairren Fortress by Chongzhen Year 2, 1st Month, 30th Day to discuss "bandit suppression" matters. Lateness would be treated as "bandit collaboration."

"Everyone knows what happened to the pirate-colluding Gou Manor." Xi Yazhou glared menacingly. "We came to Lingao—saw people suffering, bandits rampant. We organized militia for 'Eliminating tyranny, Protecting borders, Securing people'—maintaining peace for the Court. Non-cooperators oppose all Lingao people. Opposing Lingao people opposes the Court. Opposing the Court makes you rebel traitors! Anyone can execute them!" He slashed his hand downward. "Absent villages today—you notify them."

The kneeling people were confused. These "bald bandits" were pirates themselves—yet they claimed to be "for the Court"? Confusion aside, Gou Manor's bloody legend, embellished through countless retellings, had become a horror story. Nobody dared say "no"; they only murmured assent, secretly relieved their villages had wisely come.

Xi Yazhou also required each village to send one liaison to accompany the forces, plus mountain guides. Only then were they dismissed.

"Every village sent someone?" Xi Yazhou asked Xiong Buyu, checking off map-marked villages.

"Within ten *li*, all came. Within fifteen *li*, three came."

Xi Yazhou smiled confidently. "After we handle Baitu—more villages will come."

"Why summon them to Bairren?" Xiong Buyu was curious.

"Conscription and requisitions." Xi Yazhou studied the terrain map. "Lingao county—we have no opponents. Next: utilizing local manpower and resources. Chief Ma wants to seize the county seat and become magistrate himself. But Commissar Wen wants to 'surround the cities from the countryside'—use force to pressure villages, building our administrative network. The county seat is irrelevant."

"The county seat seems pointless. It's just a *yamen*. Occupation is trivial whenever."

"Exactly. People are fundamental."

"Report—Navy Commander Chen has arrived!"

Tomorrow, the mountain march would begin. The Navy support flotilla couldn't resupply Army until reaching Baitu. Xi Yazhou coordinated with flotilla commander Chen Haiyang. Both decided: advance separately tomorrow. Army would reach Baitu's perimeter by 3 p.m. Then—surrender demand to villagers. If failed, Xi Yazhou would fire 3 red rockets—*Fubo* would bombard Baitu harbor. If successful, one green rocket. With a recruited firecracker craftsman, signal rockets were feasible, though not signal flares.

They established various communication signals and contingency plans. Past 6 p.m., Chen Haiyang rowed back to the *Fubo*, declining Xi Yazhou's dinner invitation but taking the Navy's share of vegetables and eggs. Xi Yazhou was certain: *Fubo* had better food. This irked him—especially seeing his orderly bring steaming rice noodle soup.

Dinner: Grassland-3 and -4. The former was rice noodle wrappers; the latter was rice vermicelli. Boiled until soft—with complete seasoning packets: salt, dried scallion, pepper. Unfortunately there was no chili—otherwise chili oil would have perfected it. The nearby villagers' vegetables and eggs enriched the soup.

The taste was quite good—just lacking fat. Xi Yazhou again witnessed the local farmers' appetites: one soldier ate nearly three *jin* of rice noodles before stopping.

The officers' soup had sliced luncheon meat. Frugal traditions showed their power—one 125g can was split by two. The cutter had to slice precisely equal. Finally—even the can's inner fat residue was hot-soup-rinsed clean.

"Who knew luncheon meat would become a delicacy!" Dongmen Chuiyu sipped rice noodle soup. Luncheon meat made broth richer—added various spice mixed flavors. Better than plain seasoned soup. Grassland-3 and -4 seemed fine—the drawback was fat deficiency. Without luncheon meat—plain seasoning packets were bland.

He noted his impressions of the rations in his notebook. He walked outside to stretch, but kicked something that went *clanging* away. Looking closely, he saw an empty luncheon meat can.

"Such waste! Who did this!" Dongmen Chuiyu was outraged. Tinned steel plate was beyond the Industrial Department's capability. In the cafeteria's daily cooking, cans, vacuum foil bags, and plastic bags were all carefully washed clean and returned to the Planning Committee warehouse. He searched and collected all the cans. Rushed to headquarters reporting to Xi Yazhou. That evening, all officers received an order: used cans must be washed clean and collected.

Artillery Training Battery Commander Ying Yu was on the mountain march. His uniform was soaked with sweat. Was this really winter? He paused, sipping salted water from his canteen and studying the winding mountain path.

Dense forest obscured the column. The terrain wasn't steep—but it was rough going. Ying Yu could imagine his unit: Army Artillery Training platoon—three 12-pounder mountain howitzers. The cannons were disassembled for mule transport. A standard 12-pounder howitzer required three mules: the first carried the barrel, the second carried the frame and wheels, and the third carried two ammo boxes. Each box held 8 shells: 2 explosive and 6 solid. Two boxes: 16 rounds. The normal load was 48 rounds per gun. But transmigrators' total horses and mules weren't enough. Even deploying just 3 guns consumed most of the Farm's horses. Wu Nanhai demanded Ying Yu guarantee all horses returned safely. He even sent Yang Baogui with the expedition for horse care, though Yang could ride the ships, avoiding the foot march.

Several artillerymen passed Ying Yu. Like the infantry, they had full gear and rifles. The sole exception was a 15-year-old kid without a rifle: a Military-Political School artillery cadet, skinny as a monkey. Ying Yu exempted his rifle.

"When will we have fully horse-and-mule-ized horse artillery?" Ying Yu sighed.

Behind the artillery came a dozen porters—all carrying and shouldering artillery gear. These were yesterday's village "liaisons." Xi Yazhou had prepared them for possible additional manpower and material needs, sending them back to arrange. Ying Yu said that since they were idle, they should help carry equipment to reduce the burden on the horses. Artillery had too much miscellaneous gear.

Bei Wei, with the Recon Team and guides, advanced several kilometers—conducting screen and sweep, clearing potential ambushes and observation posts. According to the guides, Baitu rarely contacted neighboring villages. They traded directly by ship—food, supplies, even shipbuilding timber came by sea. They lacked nothing and lived comfortably. Occasional markets—often paying in foreign silver. Someone had seen large foreign ships visiting Baitu.

Baitu, due to local bandit harassment, had stockades guarding road junctions. As for maritime powers—they didn't attack. Pirates frequently bought and repaired ships at Baitu.
