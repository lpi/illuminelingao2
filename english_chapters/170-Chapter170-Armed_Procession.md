# Chapter 170: Armed Procession

News of "bald bandits" bivouacking nearby spread to surrounding villages. Obviously 200+ fully armed, artillery-equipped soldiers weren't touring. Before dark—villages within 10+ *li* sent envoys with wine, dried meat, chickens and ducks to visit.

"Was about to summon them—delivered themselves." Xi Yazhou had an Executive Committee mandate: pacify roadside villages, secure allegiance.

The headquarters tent had a radio installed, a laptop computer displaying Xi Yazhou's beloved wargame—now converted to an operational simulation system. Outside—two soldiers frantically pedaled a dual-person generator.

Xi Yazhou sat on a folding canvas chair before the headquarters tent. Behind him: two flag staffs flying his favorite red-yellow triangular pennants—personal command flag. The transmigrator army's official flag remained under debate. Watching bent-backed elders in their best clothes shuffle toward him through the camp gate... this power feeling was rather enjoyable.

Through three translators—besides Lingao dialect, some spoke military dialect, some Qiongzhou dialect—Xi Yazhou explained: just passing through, departing at dawn. Gifts refused. Unexpectedly—this declaration made elders weep—kneeling, desperately pleading, practically hugging his legs.

"What's happening?" Xi Yazhou was puzzled.

Translator Xiong Buyu was also confused—why did a harmless announcement produce this? After much questioning: elders assumed gift rejection meant dissatisfaction—expecting extortion. All were crying about villages starving to death.

"Fine, accept the wine." Xi Yazhou half laughed, half sympathized with commoners' plight. "Keep dried meat and poultry. Send fresh vegetables and eggs instead."

Hearing Xi Yazhou's request—elders rose as if pardoned. Villages then jointly presented "Chief Xi" 50 *liang* silver. Xi Yazhou firmly refused. This earned praise: "General is incorruptible," "Chief is pure and selfless." Xiong Buyu translated a few—then stopped bothering.

Xi Yazhou—face serious—announced per Executive Committee policy: all villages must send representatives to Bairren Fortress by Chongzhen-2 Year, 1st Month, 30th Day to discuss "bandit suppression" matters. Lateness would be treated as "bandit collaboration."

"What happened to pirate-colluding Gou Manor—everyone knows." Xi Yazhou glared menacingly. "We came to Lingao—saw people suffering, bandits rampant. We organized militia for 'Eliminating tyranny, Protecting borders, Securing people'—maintaining peace for the Court. Non-cooperators oppose all Lingao people. Opposing Lingao people opposes the Court. Opposing the Court makes you rebel traitors! Anyone can execute them!" He slashed his hand downward. "Absent villages today—you notify them."

Kneeling people were confused. These "bald bandits" were pirates themselves—yet claiming "for the Court"? Confusion aside—Gou Manor's bloody legend, embellished through countless retellings, had become a horror story. Nobody dared say "no"—only murmured assent, secretly relieved their villages wisely came.

Xi Yazhou also required each village to send one liaison accompanying forces, plus mountain guides. Only then were they dismissed.

"Every village sent someone?" Xi Yazhou asked Xiong Buyu, checking off map-marked villages.

"Within 10-*li*—all came. Within 15-*li*—three came."

Xi Yazhou smiled confidently: "After we handle Baitu—more villages will come."

"Why summon them to Bairren?" Xiong Buyu was curious.

"Conscription and requisitions." Xi Yazhou studied the terrain map. "Lingao county—we have no opponents. Next: utilizing local manpower and resources. Chief Ma wants to seize the county seat—become magistrate himself. But Commissar Wen wants rural-surrounding-cities—use force to pressure villages, building our administrative network. The county seat is irrelevant."

"County seat seems pointless. Just a *yamen*. Occupation's trivial whenever."

"Exactly. People are fundamental."

"Report—Navy Commander Chen arrived!"

Tomorrow—mountain marching began. The Navy support flotilla couldn't resupply Army until reaching Baitu. Xi Yazhou coordinated with flotilla commander Chen Haiyang. Both decided: advance separately tomorrow. Army would reach Baitu's perimeter by 3pm. Then—surrender demand to villagers. If failed, Xi Yazhou would fire 3 red rockets—*Fubo* would bombard Baitu harbor. If successful—1 green rocket. With a recruited firecracker craftsman—signal rockets were feasible though not signal flares.

They established various communication signals and contingency plans. Past 6pm—Chen Haiyang rowed back to *Fubo*, declining Xi Yazhou's dinner invitation—bringing Navy's vegetable and egg share. Xi Yazhou was certain: *Fubo* had better food. This irked him—especially seeing his orderly bring steaming rice noodle soup.

Dinner: Grassland-3 and -4. Former was rice-noodle wrapper; latter was rice vermicelli. Boiled until soft—with complete seasoning packets: salt, dried scallion, pepper. Unfortunately no chili—otherwise chili oil would perfect it. Nearby villagers' vegetables and eggs enriched soup contents.

Taste was quite good—just lacking fat. Xi Yazhou again witnessed local farmers' appetites: one soldier ate nearly 3-*jin* rice noodles before stopping.

Officers' soup had sliced luncheon meat. Frugal traditions showed power—one 125g can split by two. The cutter had to slice precisely equal. Finally—even the can's inner fat residue was hot-soup-rinsed clean.

"Who knew luncheon meat would become a delicacy!" Dongmen Chuiyu sipped rice noodle soup. Luncheon meat made broth richer—added various spice mixed flavors. Better than plain seasoned soup. Grassland-3 and -4 seemed fine—drawback was fat deficiency. Without luncheon meat—plain seasoning packets were bland.

He noted ration impressions in his notebook. Walked outside for stretching—but—kicked something *clang*-ing far. Looking closely: an empty luncheon meat can.

"Such waste! Who did this!" Dongmen Chuiyu was outraged. Tinned steel plate was beyond the Industrial Department's capability. Cafeteria daily cooking—cans, vacuum foil bags, plastic bags were all carefully washed clean, returned to Planning Committee warehouse. He searched—collected all cans. Rushed to headquarters reporting to Xi Yazhou. That evening—all officers received an order: eaten cans must be washed clean, collected.

Artillery Training Battery Commander Ying Yu was mountain marching. Sweat-soaked uniform. Was this winter? He paused—sipping salted water from his canteen—studying the winding mountain path.

Dense forest obscured the column. Terrain wasn't steep—but rough going. Ying Yu could imagine his unit: Army Artillery Training platoon—3 × 12-pounder mountain howitzers. Cannons disassembled for mule transport. Standard 12-pounder howitzer required 3 mules each: first carried barrel, second carried frame and wheels, third carried two ammo boxes. Each box held 8 shells: 2 explosive, 6 solid. Two boxes: 16 rounds. Normal load was 48 rounds per gun. But transmigrators' total horses and mules weren't enough. Even deploying just 3 guns consumed most Farm horses. Wu Nanhai demanded Ying Yu guarantee all horses returned safely. He even sent Yang Baogui with the expedition for horse care—though Yang could ride ships, avoiding foot marching.

Several artillerymen passed Ying Yu. Like infantry—full gear and rifles. Sole exception: a 15-year-old kid without a rifle. Military-Political School artillery cadet—skinny as a monkey. Ying Yu exempted his rifle.

"When will we have fully horse-and-mule-ized horse artillery?" Ying Yu sighed.

Behind artillery: a dozen porters—all carrying and shouldering artillery gear. These were yesterday's village "liaisons." Xi Yazhou had prepared them for possible additional manpower and material needs—sending them back to arrange. Ying Yu said: since they're idle—help carry equipment, reduce horse burden. Artillery had too much miscellaneous gear.

Bei Wei with the Recon Team and guides advanced several kilometers—conducting screen and sweep, clearing potential ambushes and observation posts. Per guides: Baitu rarely contacted neighboring villages. They traded directly by ship—food, supplies, even shipbuilding timber came by sea. They lacked nothing, lived comfortably. Occasional markets—often paying in foreign silver. Someone had seen large foreign ships visiting Baitu.

Baitu—due to local bandit harassment—had stockades guarding road junctions. As for maritime powers—they didn't attack. Pirates frequently bought and repaired ships at Baitu.
