# Chapter 1810 - Propaganda Work

The conversation with Ding Ding had touched on a broader issue that Liu Xiang found increasingly frustrating: the gap between what the Council of Elders was trying to accomplish and how the Propaganda Department communicated it.

The problem wasn't that their policies were bad—quite the opposite. Public sanitation campaigns reduced disease. Currency reform would stabilize the economy. Tax rationalization would reduce corruption. These were genuinely beneficial programs.

But the way they were announced made them sound like arbitrary impositions. "The Council of Elders has decreed..." "All citizens must comply with..." "Failure to observe regulations will result in..."

This was the language of occupation, not governance. It might achieve compliance, but it wouldn't win hearts.

"We're not the Ming dynasty," Liu Xiang had argued at a propaganda coordination meeting. "We can actually explain our reasoning. We should use that capability."

"The common people don't need explanations," one propaganda cadre had replied. "They just need clear instructions."

"That's exactly the kind of thinking that made people hate the Ming. 'The emperor has spoken, therefore obey.' We're supposed to be different."

The meeting had ended inconclusively. Director Qiu had his own theories about mass communication, heavily influenced by what he remembered of 20th-century propaganda techniques. Liu Xiang thought those techniques were poorly suited to 17th-century Guangzhou, but convincing Qiu was difficult.

Part of the problem was institutional. The Propaganda Department reported to Wudaokou, not to local government. Liu Xiang could suggest, request, and complain, but he couldn't order them to change their approach. This was intentional—propaganda was considered too important to leave to local discretion—but it created coordination problems.

Another part was cultural. Many Elders had absorbed the assumption that the Council was so obviously superior that its mere authority should command obedience. They saw explanation as weakness, as though admitting that their policies required justification.

Liu Xiang saw it differently. The Ming had collapsed not because its policies were bad—though many were—but because it had lost legitimacy in the eyes of the people. The Council of Elders' military superiority could conquer territory, but only good governance could hold it. And good governance required communication.

He picked up another document from the stack—a report on public reaction to the new currency announcement. The response was mixed. Merchants were cautiously receptive to the silver dollars, which at least represented standardized weight and purity. But the circulation vouchers were viewed with deep suspicion. Too many people remembered—or had heard stories about—the Great Ming Treasure Notes and their catastrophic inflation.

The propaganda around the new currency had been particularly poor. The official announcements emphasized technical details—exchange rates, denominations, anti-counterfeiting features—while completely failing to address the underlying anxiety: "Will this paper hold its value?"

Liu Xiang drafted a note to the Finance Ministry's communications office, suggesting they emphasize the reserve backing, the exchange guarantee, and the Council's track record in Hainan. Facts that might actually reassure merchants, rather than bureaucratic specifications that meant nothing to them.

Whether anyone would listen was another matter.

The afternoon wore on. More documents, more decisions, more compromises. A request from the Health Department for additional facilities. A complaint from the Harbor Authority about overlapping jurisdiction. A report on grain prices that showed slight increases—within acceptable ranges, but worth monitoring.

Each item was a thread in the vast fabric of governing a major city. Pull one wrong and others might unravel. Leave one neglected and problems would compound.

By evening, Liu Xiang's coffee pot was empty and his eyes were tired. Zhang Yunmi had long since gone home. The building was quiet except for the night duty staff.

He stood and stretched, looking out the window at the city spreading below. Thousands of cooking fires sent smoke rising into the evening air. Hundreds of thousands of people going about their lives, largely unaware of the bureaucratic machinery that shaped their daily existence.

This was what they had conquered. A living, breathing metropolis with centuries of history, millions of stories, countless interlocking needs and interests. And he was supposed to make it work better than the Ming had.

No pressure at all.

Liu Xiang gathered his papers, shut off the office lamp, and headed home. Tomorrow would bring another mountain of documents. But for now, Guo Xier would have dinner waiting, and he could think about something other than circulation vouchers and vice taxes for a few hours.

The work of building a new world could resume in the morning.
