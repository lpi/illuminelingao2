# Chapter 548 - The Informant

In her terrifying dreams, government troops attacked, the Australians were defeated, and the Chiefs were dragged one by one to the execution ground to be beheaded. Somehow, her whole family was there too: her father, mother, brother, even her younger brother who had died in childhood and her grandparents who had passed away years ago—all bound, with execution placards stuck in their backs. The ground ran with rivers of blood. She wanted to explain to the officials that her family weren't hair-shaven bandits, just refugees who had been swept up. But she couldn't speak. Later, she tried to run—she wasn't tied, and no one was guarding her, yet she couldn't lift her feet. She shouted in desperation.

Similar nightmares occurred several times. Waking from a nightmare, she resolved several times to quit school the next day, go home, tell her family, and flee far away from this place.

But by daylight, she hesitated again. Flee? To where? There was no paradise under the Great Ming sky. Let alone paradise, for commoners like ants, finding a place just to live and survive was hard enough. Lingao wasn't paradise, but at least it allowed her family to live in peace, with food, clothes, and shelter. It gave them hope for the future. were they to return to that wandering life of displacement and near-destruction?

So what if it was rebellion? Lu Cheng thought. Without the Australians, the family might have died in the streets long ago, and she would probably have fallen into the hands of human traffickers, sold to suffer somewhere unknown. She steeled her heart: even if it meant rebellion, she would follow the Chiefs, even if it meant death—at least she lived a few good days now. If they could defeat the government troops, future days would be even better.

"The Australian Chiefs saved our whole family. Even if it means beheading for rebellion, we'll follow them," Lu Cheng sighed. "What else can we do?"

"I just don't know if the Chiefs can hold out," Yao Yulan said. "My dad moved our whole livelihood to Lingao. If the Chiefs can't beat the government troops, our family is finished." Unlike the refugees who had suffered enough, Yao Yulan lacked the courage to burn her bridges.

"You have a family. So do I," Lu Cheng said. Suddenly she remembered something. "The Chiefs have such good firearms; the government troops surely can't beat them."

"And that big iron ship. The government troops can't even beat pirates; they definitely have no chance against the Australian iron ship." Yao Yulan seemed to be cheering herself up, but then she sighed again. "It's just that the Chiefs have too few soldiers. If the government sends a swarm, I'm afraid they can't hold."

"It doesn't matter if the Australians have few soldiers; aren't we all 'soldiers'?" Ke Yun, sleeping on the bunk adjacent to the upper bunk, had been woken by their talk. She was the youngest of them all, only seventeen, and looked very thin and small. Ke Yun never mentioned her family; Yao Yulan assumed she was an orphan.

"We count as soldiers?" Yao Yulan made a fuss. "Women fighting—don't the Chiefs think it's bad luck? Women aren't allowed in the army."

"They have female officials; what's a few female soldiers?" Ke Yun said softly. "Haven't you seen them?"

"I have. A Chief Dong—pretty, but her frame is really big!" Yao Yulan gestured. "And that chest..." She pulled her shirt exaggeratedly high. "This big!"

Several girls giggled, waking up the others. Women talk was infectious; one by one, they joined the chat.

"Chief Dong is formidable. I saw her practice with a steel spear. Heard she even went to the countryside and killed bandits."

"So fierce? Was she a street performer?"

"Nonsense. Chief Dong is very learned and manages many villages. She comes to our village often."

"Isn't it Chief Du who goes to the villages often? A tall female Chief with very long legs," Lu Cheng recalled. This Chief Du acted decisively and had very short hair, but she spoke entirely in incomprehensible "Newspeak." The village headmen were all terrified of her.

"There are quite a few," Ke Yun said. "Besides, once we learn to shoot, I won't be afraid of any great general in full armor, let alone a small soldier. With the Chiefs' Six-Star Repeater, anyone who comes is dead."

The "Six-Star Repeater" was actually a revolver. The large batch of pistols the transmigrated collective purchased through the North American branch included many S&W 9mm revolvers. Many transmigrators found this pistol convenient and handy—especially the women, who almost all had one.

"That belongs to the Chiefs. Would they give them to us?" Yao Yulan, having been in Bairen Commune for over half a year, knew that things issued to indigenous people, while dozens of times better than similar items of this timeline, were far inferior to what the Chiefs used themselves. "Besides, even if they gave them to us, I wouldn't dare take a gun to battle. Hearing hundreds of men shout during army drills terrifies me."

"Yeah, fighting and killing on the battlefield—I wouldn't dare." Other girls agreed.

"What do you know?" Yang Cao, sleeping on the bunk below Ke Yun, also woke up. She hadn't spoken until now. "What the Chiefs want us to do is the work of the Australian Jinyiwei and Eastern Depot."

"What are Jinyiwei and Eastern Depot?" Most girls didn't know, but Yao Yulan and Lu Cheng did; their faces instantly changed color.

The Jinyiwei had branches in the provinces, but the Eastern Depot operated mainly in the capital; traces of Eastern Depot agents were rarely seen locally. But since Wei Zhongxian took power in the Tianqi era, even remote places saw men in "fresh clothes and angry horses, speaking the capital dialect." The name of the Eastern Depot spread from the capital to the whole country.

"You mean we're to be female agents?" Yao Yulan turned pale as a flower.

"What are agents?"

"Spies for the court," Yang Cao said. "Specializing in investigating officials and commoners. With an arrest warrant from the Ministry of Justice, they can arrest, interrogate, or just kill you."

"That fierce!" The girls gasped in unison.

"We have to kill people too?" Yao Yulan was practically scared out of her wits—she wanted to be a "cadre," not a killer.

At that moment, footsteps sounded in the corridor. Everyone shut up simultaneously—chatting without permission at night was a serious error.

Early the next morning, during the chaos of breakfast in Fangcaodi Education Park's No. 1 Canteen, Ke Yun slipped away quietly. A few minutes later, she appeared in a windowless room behind the canteen. This was one of several "safe houses" set up by the General Political Security Bureau in the Education Park. Such rooms were often situated within building clusters, findable only by those who knew the path. Political Security personnel met their informers here to listen to reports and issue instructions.

Wu Mu was waiting for her in the room. Ke Yun was actually a "Ten-Man Group" mole Wu Mu had planted in the girls' squad. Ke Yun was trained specifically for "internal control." This orphan, physically only fifteen, had been saved by the Guangzhou Station from a pile of corpses in the Nanhai County charity graveyard. Now she was a seasoned informant who wouldn't blink at betraying anyone.

She reported the girls' squad's ideological trends to Wu Mu, noting any serious disciplinary violations. Wu Mu listened carefully. In fact, Ke Yun's Mandarin was not bad; her dialect was a complete disguise.

In her report, the focus was on the recent wavering thoughts in the girls' squad. Ke Yun gave a low evaluation of Yao Yulan, considering her worldly and glib, unknowingly leading opinion within the squad.

"Yao Yulan's stance is unstable; she often spreads wavering remarks," Ke Yun said, then listed many things Yao Yulan had said. Because most indigenous personnel had low education levels and couldn't write accurate reports, Ran Yao had focused on training Ten-Man Group members in verbal repetition, retelling the subjects' words directly.

Wu Mu noted the key points of her report. He didn't ask questions during the process, waiting until she finished to avoid interrupting her flow. Then she reported Yang Cao's suspicious points—her older age, her claim of being an opera singer despite never singing, and her surprising knowledge of government secret services like the Eastern Depot and Jinyiwei—even knowing the agents were called "Fanzi."

Wu Mu wasn't interested in Yao Yulan's case; whether to expel her or observe her was minor. But Yang Cao's case was special—could this woman be a spy?

Wu Mu decided to review her file first upon returning.

"Lu Cheng often has nightmares at night," Ke Yun continued. "She wakes up frequently. She never says what she dreamed, but once I heard her talk in her sleep: '…were swept up.' I think her stance is wavering."

"Swept up" simply meant working for the Australians wasn't voluntary but forced. This implied Lu Cheng had little confidence in the transmigrated collective, believing they would eventually be suppressed by government troops—otherwise she wouldn't have such dreams.

She then reported on the other girls' thoughts and gave her own evaluations. Wu Mu took notes while listening, secret admiring Ran Yao: without the foundation Ran Yao laid, he wouldn't know how to do this job. Just training the personnel was a huge merit.

"You've done well." Wu Mu nodded in praise. Ke Yun immediately stood up. "Thank you, Chief."

"Sit down. Continue monitoring them, focusing on Yang Cao," Wu Mu instructed. "Report who she contacts most, what she says, and where she goes."

"Understood."

"As for Yao Yulan's wavering tendencies, pay attention to neutralizing her negative influence anytime," Wu Mu said. "Give everyone confidence."
