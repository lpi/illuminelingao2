# Chapter 126: Guangzhou Trip (Part 2)

Sea trials revealed that under full sail with favorable winds, the ship could reach about 12 knots—engines didn't boost speed much. However, ship handling had greatly improved—good news for transmigrators with zero hard-sail experience.

"At least we'll have a major advantage in headwinds." Lin Shenhe summarized this benefit.

Besides propulsion, the ship underwent a series of modifications: radio installation, added living quarters, reinforced cargo hold bulkheads, and several hidden compartments. These contained weapons, ammunition, and Lin Shenhe's personal cargo—for pirating opportunities.

Including transmigrators, the entire Guangzhou Procurement Delegation numbered twenty-five. Against pirate attacks, the ship was well-stocked with weapons, ammunition, plus provisions, fresh water, silver, and various supplies.

November 1, 1628—the sixth day of the tenth month, Chongzhen Year One—a fair and sunny day. Third-class transport ship *Deng Yingzhou* *(Ascending the Immortal Isle)* weighed anchor from Bopu, sailing toward the sun-drenched sea.

This grand-sounding "Third-class Transport Ship *Deng Yingzhou*" was purely fantasy from people with strong naval romanticism. Why "third-class" rather than second or fourth—only they knew.

*Deng Yingzhou* picked up Liu Gang at Denglong Point, Xuwen. This small salt merchant brought along several bodyguards and assistants. He'd originally refused to sail to Guangzhou—preferring safer overland routes. But hearing about the short-hairs' formidable firearms, he felt somewhat reassured. A slight regret: the legendary iron ships were absent.

The journey went smoothly—nothing eventful. Five days later, they arrived at Guangzhou's South City dock.

The 1628 Pearl River estuary wasn't as busy as later eras. With pirates rampant—and rumors of Admiral Yu planning to blockade ships to attack Liu Laoxiang—all foreign vessels had scattered. Few ships were on the Pearl River.

Lin Chuanqing hadn't slept well these days. This Guangzhou trip carried some risk. During his smuggling-guide days on the South Sea, he'd seen all kinds of storms. But he'd retired long ago. Though the North American faction constantly watched for piracy opportunities at sea, he most feared encountering pirate ships. Liu Laoxiang and his pirate fleet weren't to be trifled with. In his smuggling days, he'd known: encountering any country's patrol boats was manageable—at worst, the deal fell through. Encountering pirates meant total loss.

If they met Liu Xiang's pirates, this ship's lives would depend entirely on these dozen-plus rifles and two diesel engines. No one had naval combat experience. One or two pirate ships might be manageable; but if seventeen or eighteen came...

Fortunately, Liu Gang had brought a helmsman familiar with coastal routes. Under his guidance, they'd nervously hugged the coastline—fleeing into harbors at any suspicious ship. This stop-and-go sailing had been extremely difficult. Now reaching the Pearl River estuary, he could finally sleep soundly. Thinking deeply, he glanced back at Guo Yi by the other railing—couldn't help a rueful smile.

For Guo Yi, these five days at sea had been pure torment. Since being transferred to Security Group for interrogation work, his life had gained new hope. Now entrusted as Guangzhou Underground Forward Station Chief—a qualitative leap personally—he'd been recognized. Though this mission was risky, high risk meant high reward. He'd use his professional expertise to rapidly elevate his standing—eventually entering the group's upper echelons. Excited, Guo Yi had prepared complete plans and schemes—hopefully rushing toward this idealized new frontier.

Though he'd prepared for seasickness, the originally planned one or two day voyage had stretched to five days of evasive sailing—still not on land. Guo Yi's complexion had shifted from red to white to green to black... He'd never known he was prone to seasickness—apparently 78-ton wooden boats differed from thousand-ton ships. Everything worth vomiting had been expelled in the first three days' waves. For the first time since his involuntary crossing, someone had thoughts of death...

Fortunately, the worst was over. On calm sailing like now, he could occasionally venture out to breathe sea air while feigning composure. But post-landing challenges would far exceed mere seasickness. This was just a small prelude.

"Dock! Dock!" Qian Shuixie's shouts from the crow's nest stirred everyone—crowds squeezed to both rails for a look. From shipboard, a winding green ribbon stretched toward the horizon—the Pearl River. In the distance: Guangzhou's imposing city walls. Surrounding residences and fortifications were visible with the naked eye. The dockside had several small sailboats anchored. To prevent pirate raids, barriers surrounded the dock.

Stimulated by landing hopes, everyone strained to berth. The dock workers—mostly dark-skinned, thin—seeing these people appearing tall and robust (from future nutritional abundance), gathered curiously to investigate. Meng De was first to jump ashore—followed by Qian Shuixie, Zhou Weisen, and others. Though everyone had dressed as Ming people with fake hair buns—not easily exposed—military habits still made them quickly assume alert stances. Both sides thus faced off in this strange atmosphere...

"Why aren't you coming ashore? What's the delay?" A coquettish voice came from the cabin rear.

Everyone turned—seeing a stunningly beautiful woman parting the curtain to peer out. Her high cloud-like coiffure seemed casually pinned yet perfectly draped several strands across her gently heaving bosom. An indescribable languid elegance. Dazzling melon-seed face; gauze-veiled crystalline skin rivaling frost and snow—surpassing lotus. A pair of limpid autumn eyes, clear yet misty. Beneath a small pert nose: tender lips like rose petals—plump and dewy. Every glance and smile carried myriad charms—truly heart-stopping.

Meng De's group was instantly stupefied. The dock workers lost their souls—eyes wide, mouths hanging, drool flowing unconsciously. Even if struck dead right now, they'd probably have no reaction.

A cough came from the cabin—Guo Yi emerged, affecting experience, cupping his hands: "A family womenfolk. Apologies for the disruption. Please forgive us." He quickly ushered the beauty back inside—preventing further chaos.

This beauty was the transmigrators' famed Intelligence Group's ultimate secret weapon—codenamed "Miss P," PEPEI. True gender: classified at highest level. PEPEI's disguise skills were first-rate even by modern standards. During the voyage, everyone had been dazzled by continuous transformations from lolita to young boy to mature beauty. This reappearance—even Meng De's group, supposedly immune—still couldn't resist. Profound mastery indeed.

Inside the cabin, Guo Yi reproached: "Miss P, please understand: though you're directly commissioned by Committee's Intelligence Information Group, I'm Guangdong Forward Station Chief—authorized to coordinate overall. Please don't create difficulties for our collective operation." Guo Yi understood: PEPEI was this Guangzhou mission's most important secret weapon. But nothing could jeopardize overall plans—hence this reminder.

PEPEI smiled sweetly: "Why so serious? Never expected these locals would be so easy. My skills were almost wasted." Guo Yi pondered briefly: "We'll now establish the intelligence station as planned. Frontline base construction will be expedited. But whether restaurant or inn—we still have personnel shortages. I'll find solutions. Meanwhile, please stay aboard—avoid complications. This work isn't suitable for your involvement." PEPEI smiled faintly—nodding acquiescence.

Xiao Zishan said: "Let's discuss post-landing actions." As delegation leader, he was only responsible for meeting Gao Ju and procuring Industrial Department needs. Forward station establishment was entirely Guo Yi's responsibility.

"We'll split up. Commissioner Xiao—meet Gao Ju and Manager Sun about cooperation—you're acquaintances. I'll take Old Yan and others—have Liu Gang show us Guangzhou's markets—scout for shop openings. Everyone else stays aboard for now."

"I'll return to the mansion first—send sedan chairs and mule carts to pick everyone up. Let them relax there. Bei Wei knows Sun Chang—he can lead." Xiao Zishan knew everyone had been cooped up five or six days—keeping them aboard might cause trouble. He left Bei Wei to maintain order.

Arrangements settled; after brief preparation, Xiao Zishan—protected by special forces and the North American contingent—headed toward Guangzhou city.

Xiao Zishan felt some familiarity revisiting old grounds; others were purely curious. Most hadn't even visited Lingao's county seat. Now suddenly in southern China's most prosperous commercial city of this era—"dazzling" was entirely fitting.

But this wasn't sightseeing time. Returning to the Huifu Street mansion, caretaker Sun Chang and the Gao family staff were unchanged. Seeing the master return, everyone was delighted. During their year-plus absence, the mansion had been properly restored: walls and embankments renovated, rubble cleared, buildings repaired. Even a vegetable garden had been planted in the yard.
