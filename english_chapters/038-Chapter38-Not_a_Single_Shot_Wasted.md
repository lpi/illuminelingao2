-------------------------

"This is the Xuanzhu boat." Ran Yao pointed to a flower boat on the embankment for him to see through the Xiangfei bamboo curtain.

Lin Shenhe raised the telescope and slowly adjusted the focus. The sky outside the window had already darkened a bit, and the light was soft. Really good weather.

This was a restaurant in White Goose Pond. Yesterday, people from the escort agency rented a private room at the highest point of the third floor alone. Ran Yao and Bei Wei made uninterrupted observations for a whole day here and figured out all the situations.

The location chosen by the bandits to hide the hostage still had some tricks: Hezi Embankment was the outermost embankment of White Goose Pond, and the Xuanzhu boat was the outermost one moored on the embankment. Just sculling outward, it was the broad Pearl River. Not only was it convenient to get on and off the boat and easy to avoid eyes and ears, but it was also easy to flee if something happened.

During the reconnaissance, it was also found that this group of people had set up two other lookouts nearby. One was on a small boat selling boat porridge moored at Renzi Embankment separated by an embankment from Hezi Embankment, and the other was selling medicine on the shore.

On the flower boat, there should be two men guarding. One was fixed on the rear watching tower, and the other often appeared on and off the boat - the escort of Qiwei Escort Agency told Ran Yao that this was the bouncer of the flower boat.

Lin Shenhe adjusted the focus bit by bit, observing the slope below, and calculating the shooting distance. From here to the end of the embankment, it was about one hundred meters. The Xuanzhu boat was moored far from other flower boats, standing a bit lonely at the end of the embankment. This should be a warning distance specially reserved by the bandits for secrecy. Unfortunately, this made it convenient for his shooting - if it were moored one after another like other boats, it would be difficult for him to see the movement on the boat clearly.

Is President Wen really on this flower boat? Is he enjoying the warm fragrance and soft jade in this boudoir, or being ravaged? This is really hard to say.

He "called the roll" one by one for the targets he would take care of. They were all dark and thin men - since arriving in this space-time, he hadn't seen a fat one. The photos of these people had been shown repeatedly to the personnel participating in the operation before departure, and they were basically familiar by heart - even the procuress and prostitutes had photos.

Once they were found to be abnormal, even women had to be killed. This was instructed by Bei Wei, who also specially cited many examples of Vietnamese female agents in the Self-Defense Counterattack against Vietnam to educate him.

What hatred did they have with him? Although these were not good people, from an emotional point of view, like President Wen, they were purely strangers. Lin Shenhe shook his head, trying hard not to let himself think nonsense. As a member of the Transmigrators, anyone who harmed the interests of the Transmigrators could be killed.

Confirming the position and distance of each target one by one. He put down the telescope and dragged the table over. A temporarily modified pillow was placed on it - the accuracy of prone shooting was much higher than kneeling shooting. He could shoot lying on the table.

"Shoot when you hear firecrackers downstairs." Ran Yao reminded him again and went downstairs quickly. He looked at his watch 5:20.

Lin Shenhe took off his helmet and the cumbersome coat. The thickness of clothes would also affect shooting accuracy. After lying well on the table, adjusting the angle of his body with his left elbow as the center, he aimed the rifle at the target.

Who to choose as the first target was decided by Ran Yao. This medicine seller was at the entrance of Hezi Embankment.

In an instant, the head of the medicine peddler filled the entire scope. Lin Shenhe lifted his abdomen slightly off the table surface so that the abdominal breathing undulation and the pulsation of large blood vessels would not affect shooting. To hit the first shot at one hundred meters in an outdoor environment with an unfamiliar rifle required 120% care. Swallowing a mouthful of saliva, he said to the walkie-talkie: "Lin Shenhe is ready."

Bei Wei's group lay in ambush on a small boat 100 meters away from the "Xuanzhu" boat.

Xiao Zishan waited a little further away with the supporting escorts and two mule carts.

With the words "ready" coming from each group in the walkie-talkie. Ran Yao felt much quieter around. His five-shot shotgun was loaded, and a hunting knife was ready to be unsheathed at any time. He reminded himself again that this was a rescue operation, not an arrest.

The moment the firecrackers crackled, Lin Shenhe pulled the trigger. The movement of the index finger was almost not felt by the right hand. The first bullet deviated a little, splashing a puff of smoke on the ground.

Almost without any pause, completely subconsciously ejecting the shell, loading and firing, a red dot immediately appeared on the head of the medicine peddler, and he fell to the ground. In the moment of adjusting the scope, he glimpsed Ran Yao rushing towards the flower boat, running with large strides holding the five-shot shotgun. The black cloak floated up, revealing the camouflage uniform and the Type 80 helmet - in a classical environment of peach red and willow green, this scene was extremely discordant, so that he still remembered it many years later.

Ran Yao remembered that Lin Shenhe's second target was the boat porridge peddler. Gunshots could not be distinguished in the sound of firecrackers, but the peddler obviously was not shot. He grinned a mouth full of snow-white teeth, pulled out three small knives from behind, with blood-red cloth strips wrapped around the handles - Ran Yao pulled the trigger completely subconsciously. The tongue of fire spewed from the five-shot hunting gun was dazzlingly bright. The flying knife thrower fell into the water as if punched fiercely, and the red silk small knives fell messily on the ground.

Screams and cries rang out. The few pedestrians and peddlers on the embankment scattered for their lives. No one dared to run towards the embankment entrance where this evil spirit came from. They either jumped into the water or lay on the ground shivering, burying their heads in the soil.

Lin Shenhe's second target chose the archer on the rear watching tower - this was not found in the prior intelligence, thinking it was just an ordinary lookout. Any person's movement in the scope was magnified 4 times. When he found that this sentry picked up a bow, he immediately fired two shots in succession, killing this sharp shooter who could pierce a willow leaf at a hundred paces on the watching tower.

Seeing two big black men coming aggressively straight towards their flower boat, the bouncer on the boat knew it was bad. Retreating into the flower boat while shouting something, his back hand had already pulled out an iron ruler. Just as Ran Yao wanted to shoot, a blood flower suddenly bloomed on this person's shoulder. A 5.6mm bullet penetrated straight through the shoulder and back, and he fell straight down into the cabin.

Rushing into the cabin, several women knelt on the ground unable to speak. Such fierce and strange figures exceeded their imagination. Ran Yao was too lazy to ask more. Just as he was about to kick open the middle cabin door, he saw the curtain move slightly. He and the team member fired almost simultaneously. The strong smell of gunpowder smoke filled the entire cabin. With a scream, a big black man fell out from inside, covered in blood, clutching a dagger, and holding a seven-star dart.

"Big Brother Wang!" A prostitute screamed.

Although his face was already blurred by lead shots, his stature, appearance and clothing, plus the prostitute's voice just now, fully explained that this was the leader surnamed Wang who instigated the kidnapping. Ran Yao breathed a sigh of relief. The chief culprit didn't run away! Just about to continue searching, he suddenly heard Lin Shenhe reporting urgently in the walkie-talkie: "Quickly go save President Wen! A small boat beside the flower boat ran away!"

From this position, he could see the small boat moving, but it was blocked by the flower boat, so he couldn't hit the sculler.

Fortunately, Bei Wei was intercepting on the water. As soon as Lin Shenhe's voice fell, he discovered the moving small boat and fired two shots at the stern of the small boat. Screams were heard immediately.

"Row fast!"

The two rowing escorts were dumbfounded. They only woke up after hearing the stern reminder and rowed the boat vigorously.

The two boats gradually approached. Bei Wei estimated the distance and jumped onto the boat. Unexpectedly, before he could stand firm, a man rushed out of the cabin and slashed at his face with a knife, fast and ruthless. In terms of skill fighting on this small boat, Bei Wei was far inferior to this person, but he had a 5-shot shotgun in his hand - he pulled the trigger like a conditioned reflex. The generational difference of weapons was tragic - 16 buckshots almost beat this person into a honeycomb face to face. The distance was so close that blood sprayed onto Bei Wei's face.

Bei Wei didn't hesitate and rushed straight into the cabin room. This kind of small boat was used for accommodation of people on the flower boat. The cabin was very small, only accommodating a bed and a table. Lying on the bed was exactly President Wen.

"Target cleared!" Bei Wei shouted into the walkie-talkie, "President Wen has been found," touching his mouth and nose, the breath was steady and normal, seeming to be in a coma, "Safe."

"All retreat!" Ran Yao's voice came from the walkie-talkie, "Check if there are modern items in the cabin. Take away what can be taken, throw all that can't be taken into the water."

"What about you?"

"Searching for lost items. Leave after finding. Meet at the receiving point!"

"Safety first."

"Understood."

Bei Wei commanded the team members and escorts to carry President Wen out. He searched in the cabin for a while. Except for some women's powder and the like in the drawer, there was nothing valuable. Coming out, he picked up the shotgun shells on the deck, fumbled over the two blood-blurred corpses, and stuffed whatever bits and pieces he grabbed into the nylon bag at his waist. He hurriedly retreated to the rowing boat and rowed towards the receiving place all the way.

From the firecrackers sounding to President Wen being helped onto the mule cart, the whole process took only four minutes and a few seconds. The bandits were powerless to defend against such a carefully planned surprise attack. When the mule cart started, that string of ten-thousand-count firecrackers was still crackling, as if celebrating the first victory of the Transmigrators.
