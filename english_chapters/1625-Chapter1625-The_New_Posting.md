# Chapter 1625 - The New Posting

"Before, I said there were too many radishes and too few pits. Now that the branch bases are opening up, it's actually a case of too many pits and too few radishes." Liu Xiang shook his head and decided to make a list to organize his thoughts.

Vietnam. Looking at it now, its main positioning was as a coal base and a rice supply base. However, since the Grand Library specially provided materials on the southern war, going there would probably mean engaging in armed colonization? With the population explosion reaching this point, whether it was food or fuel, the Transmigration Group's demand was like a suddenly erupting black hole. The previous sentimental trade with Vietnam could no longer satisfy the Senate's stomach—and its boilers. Judging from the recent "Two Journals and One Newspaper," the call for taking more direct measures against Vietnam was very high; phrases like "Recapture the Jiu Zhen and Ri Nan Commanderies of our Great Han Realm" appeared frequently.

As for Ryukyu, after reading the *Historical Research* from the Grand Library, Liu Xiang roughly understood that this historical period was the time slot when the Ryukyu—DYD issue "since ancient times" went wrong: the Satsuma Domain used force to compel the Sho Dynasty to pay tribute to Satsuma and actually controlled Ryukyu. From this moment on, Japan started the process of Japanization, colonization, and localization of Ryukyu. Although Ryukyu continued to profess allegiance to the Ming and Qing subsequently, it had actually become a vassal of Satsuma.

Leaving aside this just-started historical hot topic, Ryukyu was an important maritime landmark for the Northeast Asia route in the entire East Asian region—excluding the Senate. From the topographical map, trade ships from Fujian sailed north along the Ryukyu Islands, using the islands and reefs along the way as navigation guides and supply points; it was an important central hub for navigation in East Asia. Controlling Ryukyu didn't mean much to the Senate, which could navigate along ocean currents relying on charts, but indirectly controlling the Sino-Japanese trade routes of other maritime merchants meant that monopolizing trade with Japan was just around the corner. The sulfur on several of Ryukyu's volcanic islands was also an industrial raw material urgently needed by the Senate. Therefore, the goal of going to Ryukyu seemed clear as well.

However, compared to Vietnam and Guangzhou, Ryukyu was insignificant, belonging to an idle move; taking it or not didn't matter much. As a long-time local administrative official, sending him there would be a bit of "using a sledgehammer to crack a nut."

"Guangzhou—" Liu Xiang started muttering in his heart again. This was the hardest one to guess. Speaking of Guangzhou, everyone in the Senate knew it was East Owner Guo's turf, the base of the "Guang-Lei Faction." Especially the Great World project, the first phase of which was about to be completed recently, reinforced this impression.

"Could it be a cadre rotation? To prevent becoming too powerful?" This question welled up in Liu Xiang's mind again. Judging from the Executive Committee's consistent policy, whether it was political factions or Senators' personal political speculation, as long as they didn't cross the line, free activity was generally allowed, but allowing any faction or individual to become too powerful was absolutely not permitted.

From the perspective of local factions, the weakest was the "Island Faction" of Hainan Island. Even the Sanya Grand District where Engineer Wang personally presided was actually completely dependent on the center. As for the expatriate teams in Vietnam, Hangzhou, Jeju Island, Shandong, Taiwan, etc., although some of them had considerable strength, their dependence on the center remained extremely high.

Only this Guang-Lei Faction controlled the Senate's largest and most important trade gateway. Even after the Hangzhou Station opened up the Shanghai trade channel, more than seventy percent of the Senate's trade with the Great Ming was still conducted through this portal. Moreover, Leizhou's sugar industry could be called the Senate's money printing machine. Its importance was self-evident.

It was only natural for the Executive Committee to carry out some personnel restructuring on the Guang-Lei Faction to avoid the tail wagging the dog.

However, this matter was not easy to handle. Although Liu Xiang looked forward to displaying his skills in Guangzhou, his enthusiasm quickly died down. The situation over there was different; it wasn't like here where a transfer order could change the Director of the County Office. If just anyone replaced Guo Yi, it would be easy to talk within their own system—Guo Yi would never defy organizational orders—but the problem was that his transfer would cause a huge shock in the local business circle of Guangzhou.

Would those who frequented the Purple Brand recognize you, the new owner? Liu Xiang had been a local official for several years and understood the mindset of the natives too well. The thinking of "rule by man" was truly deeply rooted in people's hearts. Although everyone in Guangzhou knew that Guo Yi represented the "Australians," East Owner Guo's transfer, regardless of whether it was considered his personal "fall from grace," "governance ceasing with the person's death" [policy changing with the official] was the norm—not to mention this was the 17th century, even in the 21st century, when a street office or county changed leaders, it was common for the predecessor's debts not to be recognized at all.

Even if he took office, the silver temporarily deposited at the Purple Brand counter would probably be withdrawn by people within a few days—after all, commercial credit in this era was built on individuals, not legal entities. If this situation occurred, leaving aside whether it counted as a major incident, it would be too embarrassing.

Of course, it would be great if Little Guo's team could stay on. But this was simply not something he could decide.

Not to mention internal issues, just speaking of Guangzhou Prefecture, there were three big troubles: the bureaucrats of Guangzhou, the Portuguese in Macau, and the Senators in Hong Kong.

The prefectural city was where the provincial bureaucrats were located. If they sent people there to run an underground government or a shadow shogunate, the high-ranking officials in the city would certainly not be willing to cooperate as background props like Wu Mingjin. Guo Yi had spent years building relationships; if he left, could Liu Xiang pick them up?

Macau was currently in a state of "legally leased land" with the Great Ming government. If they ran an underground government, should they recognize the colonial status? Emotionally speaking, they shouldn't. Although this colony was different from the "Five Ports Trading" and various land cessions done by "My Great Qing"—legally belonging to normal land leasing—a large part of the Senate still did not recognize colonies of other countries on the core territory of the Chinese nation, regardless of the form. Therefore, the call to drive out the Portuguese and take back Macau had always existed in the Senate, and it was not small.

But looking at it from the perspective of practical interests, Liu Xiang saw that Macau was currently still the most important trading port for the Senate and the Portuguese. Especially the Indian goods imported by the Senate, most still came through the Portuguese channel. Driving out the Portuguese would yield no practical benefit other than satisfying national pride. Besides, the Portuguese without a motherland were now extremely submissive to the Senate, far easier to deal with than the unruly Dutch.

The most troublesome one was actually Hong Kong. If they controlled Guangzhou, what kind of relationship would they have with Hong Kong? Liu Xiang knew that the group of Senators in Hong Kong now all intended to do something big. However, the possibility of Hong Kong becoming the Pearl of the Orient in this spacetime no longer existed. Since the Senate could rule Guangzhou directly, why use this small island at the mouth of the Pearl River which was scarce in resources in all aspects? Occupying Hong Kong and establishing a base in the past was merely to monitor Guangzhou. Once Guangzhou fell under the Senate's control, Hong Kong's value would vanish accordingly.

Currently, Hong Kong's industries had achieved a certain scale of shipbuilding development almost entirely by relying on the primary labor cooperation provided by handicraftsmen backed by Guangzhou Prefecture. Apart from this, its industrial limitations were significant, and its color of serving the military was very strong: the few agricultural processing enterprises built by the light industry system were almost entirely for the Logistics Headquarters, and they still relied on the agricultural product supply of the Pearl River Delta.

In other words, the current Hong Kong, apart from its function as a port, completely relied on the mainland for everything else. And the port function had no significance in trade apart from being meaningful to the Navy: since they could directly rule and use the various ports of Guangzhou, why bother detouring to Hong Kong?

After taking office, how would he get along with the Senators in Hong Kong? Should he ask for Hong Kong to be incorporated as part of Guangzhou?

Just thinking about it made his brain hurt...

Opening the *Compilation of Local Conditions*, Liu Xiang decided to focus his attention on local sentiments first.

After years of intervention by the Senate, the economic and social structure of Guangzhou Prefecture had undergone earth-shaking changes, so the Grand Library didn't participate in the *Compilation of Local Conditions* at all this time. This important social survey document was mainly compiled by the Guangzhou Station, with the Intelligence Bureau providing full data support. precisely because the data was detailed, it suited Liu Xiang's reading habits better than historical document compilations scraped together by the Grand Library.

Liu Xiang scanned the various data again, scribbling on paper, clustering and reclassifying the data at a coarse granularity according to his own understanding, making the data more suitable for his understanding method of political economy.

"Hmm, calculating by POPs, the situation is like this now!" Liu Xiang followed the classification mode of "Steel-ia" among the "Paradox Four Cuties," dividing the population into major types such as gentry, bureaucrats, farmers, coolies, laborers, technicians, handicraftsmen, military households, etc. Then he pulled out a printed administrative division map of Guangzhou Prefecture and marked different areas with different tags and numbers. He busied himself for a good two hours before filling in this map—then he pulled out another one that was already filled in for comparison. This one was generated by a program he wrote in his spare time over the past few months while studying these three "gift" documents. The processing flow was similar to the manual one just now, only the calculation was entirely left to the computer.

Comparing them, sure enough, there were quite a few differences between the two maps...

"I'm hurting for nothing!" Liu Xiang decisively abandoned the results of his two hours of work and stuck to using the computer-generated map for analysis. As for going back to check or whatever, Liu Xiang simply gave up—the laptop was already packed, and rummaging through boxes was inconvenient now. Anyway, it was only a sea journey of over 60 kilometers from Haikou to Lingao. This regular tugboat with turtle speed would arrive by dark. However, the data had passed through his brain just now after all; he understood it better than just looking at the computer-processed map. Many ideas popped up in a glance or a glimpse.
