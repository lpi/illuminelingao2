# Chapter 1392 - Stubborn

Within minutes of walking in, both were already drenched in sweat. Wu Zhixiang took out a handkerchief and wiped his sweat incessantly. Then Zhao Yingong led him into the reeling workshop. In the reeling workshop, treadle machines were whirring, and silkworm cocoons bobbed up and down in the pans. Steam permeated the workshop, making the moisture even heavier. Walls and floors were wet everywhere. The stench of scalded pupae, the smell of alum in the basins, mixed with moisture, coal smoke, and human sweat, made one's chest feel tight upon entering, simply unable to breathe.

Although there were many workers coming and going in the workshop, they turned a blind eye to the arrival of these two masters, attending to their own business. Only a foreman came up to pay respects. Zhao Yingong waved his hand, and the person retreated to do his own things.

The entire workshop was like a beehive. The buzzing sound of reeling machines filled the humid and sultry air. Several hundred female workers were busy at their respective reeling stations, pedaling the machines while constantly reaching into the fifty-degree hot water to fish out silk ends onto the reel. Although the environment in the workshop was harsh, they were all fully concentrated, simply not blinking an eye. Fingers seemed to be dancing; the reels above turned fast, dazzling the eyes.

To facilitate operation, all female workers in the workshop had short hair. Foreheads were also wrapped with towels—used to absorb sweat, avoiding the frequent need to wipe sweat with towels. Their clothes were dripping wet, and a small puddle of water accumulated under everyone's feet, not knowing if it was sweat from their bodies or hot water splashed from the basins.

Where had Wu Zhixiang experienced such a thing? Even though he was young and strong, he felt chest tightness and shortness of breath. Seeing several hundred female workers with the same short hair, wearing the same clothes, working according to the same rhythm, with speed so fast he couldn't even see clearly, he was appalled unknowingly.

How were these humans? Clearly like Australian machines! Wu Zhixiang thought secretly, really don't know how Australians did it? But his mood was also very excited. Although he couldn't understand very clearly, he was completely clear about the efficiency within. How could household reeling achieve such speed! No wonder every time Australians made something, the price would drop to the point where others couldn't sell even at a loss!

Although he felt chest tightness and urge to vomit, he was mentally very excited. Looking up, he saw a patrol gallery around the wall in the factory, only this patrol gallery wasn't open, installed with bamboo grid walls. Inside figures seemed to be moving.

"What is this?"

"This is the patrol gallery. Specially for inspectors to walk back and forth supervising female workers' work."

Zhao Yingong explained that the reeling products of this filature had production regulations. Each thread was limited to combining three or four cocoons. This way workers reeling silk would be slower than manual reeling. Manual reeling produced one jin of silk per day; here it was only six or seven taels. Wages here adopted piece-rate system. Female workers generally coveted producing more weight to earn more wages, often secretly adding cocoons over limit, i.e., combining five or more cocoons for one thread. Not only wasting raw materials but also affecting silk quality.

This patrol gallery was set up to supervise female workers. Inspectors patrolled back and forth on the gallery, peeping at female workers' operations through the grid—due to the grid wall's shielding, female workers couldn't see someone supervising. If an inspector found any work station having over-limit cocoon adding situation, they would immediately write a card with its number and throw it to the foreman's place. The foreman's place would immediately send someone to take the silk skein of that number for inspection. If meeting standard then not pursued, returning to female worker to continue work. But if overweight exceeded standard count by 1/3, meaning over-limit cocoon adding was much, causing silk body to be coarse and inferior, then punishment would be according to regulations.

If female workers were lazy, chatting, or doing other things violating regulations, once noted down by inspector, they would all be punished.

"So that's how it is!" Wu Zhixiang nodded, "So Brother Zhao governs the factory with military law here!"

"Military law is too heavy a word. However, running a factory, without this cannot produce peacefully." Zhao Yingong also felt he couldn't stand it much longer, but he was unwilling to lose face in front of Wu Zhixiang, so he put on an expression of not caring and being calm.

Zhao Yingong led him out from a corner of the workshop. Outside was another room. There were large windows on the walls, ventilating north and south, tall and bright. Walking out from the sultry and humid workshop, body and mind truly felt lightened.

Inside the room were many long benches with backrests made of wooden strips. Along the wall was a row of long tables, full of tea cups made of bamboo tubes. Each tea cup had a name and mark written on it—almost no one among female workers could read, so only such pattern marking method could be used. On the table, there were also several large celadon vats, covered with white cool cloth. On the wall, many towels hung, marked like the tea cups.

There were more than twenty female workers resting inside. They slumped on the long benches panting heavily one by one, wiping sweat that could never be wiped dry with towels, looking exhausted.

Several young girls with double buns in green were running about, collecting and delivering towels, washing and drying, boiling water, delivering tea... each busy as a bee.

Seeing Zhao Yingong enter, the running girls all stopped their steps one by one, retreating timidly to the side. The female workers weren't so nervous, just stood up hurriedly.

"No matter, you sit and rest." Zhao Yingong smiled. Wu Zhixiang, however, felt a chill.

"Master is here, how can we sit..." A female worker looking like a forewoman said.

"Tell you to sit then you sit, otherwise no strength to work in a while." Zhao Yingong's words were gentle but attitude very firm. The forewoman had to apologize, then let female workers sit down. But this time they weren't as relaxed as just now, appearing very restrained.

Zhao Yingong ignored them, sat down on a long bench himself, and even greeted: "Sit, sit."

What a clever and transparent person Wu Zhixiang was; he already sensed the atmosphere was wrong. Besides, sitting with a group of female workers in this placeless place was really a bit improper. But since the host invited, inconvenient to disobey, he had to sit down awkwardly.

Seeing him sit down, several young girls immediately came over to serve. An older girl asked: "Does Master want tea?"

Zhao Yingong said: "Walked half a day under big sun, just pour some Artemisia tea that female workers drink. Pour a cup for this Young Master Wu too."

Two cups of Artemisia tea were brought over—these large porcelain vats contained various drinks for relieving summer heat and quenching thirst, specially prepared for female workers in the reeling workshop. There were Artemisia tea as well as salt soda water mixed with salt, sugar, and citric acid—of course, there was no carbon dioxide inside.

A young girl originally busy outside walked in quietly at this time. Seeing Zhao Yingong's expression was indifferent, seemingly treating her as nonexistent, she had to walk over and kneel saying: "Master..."

Zhao Yingong drank several mouthfuls of tea, rested a breath, and finally spoke: "Asked you to lead people to study, you are really diligent!"

"Replying to Master!" Kneeling on the ground was exactly Xihua. because she came from a scholar's family and was literate, she was cultivated as a normal school student, studying with Zhao Yingong in the Villa's private school while also responsible for teaching literacy.

Xihua trembled, forcing a smile: "Since Master handed these children to this servant, this servant naturally wants to do utmost to serve."

Zhao Yingong sneered: "Utmost to serve to the point of not even listening to my words?" Finishing speaking he lifted the tea cup and took a sip. The room full of people were scared to breathe loudly.

"This servant dares not." Xihua bowed head, "Master summoned female musicians to serve, originally was their proper duty. Just that these few girls have been learning silk and bamboo tuning strings, missing too many books. This servant feared delaying them..."

"Delaying them, truly ridiculous. I asked you to teach them books and characters, not asked them to take Imperial Examination for Jinshi!" Zhao Yingong sneered, "You, this female teacher, are getting more and more respectable—"

"This servant dares not!" Xihua couldn't hold up anymore, touching head to ground, trembling voice said, "This servant dares not have heart of disrespecting superior, just thought Master wanted them to study well, to be of great use in future..."

Zhao Yingong smiled: "Good, even if you did wrong thing out of good heart, I won't pursue your fault today. Just that you said you wanted to lecture books and make up lessons for them, why brought them here again?"

"Reporting to Master," Xihua said, "After afternoon lecture ended, this servant brought them here to help." Finishing speaking she kowtowed again, "This servant dares not deceive."

"You do have a kind heart!" Zhao Yingong sneered, putting down tea cup. Just about to get up and leave. Xihua who had been kneeling on ground suddenly said:

"Master, this servant absolutely has no heart of slighting Master, even more dare not make decisions unauthorizedly. Only sisters and aunties here have to work six shichen every day. Nowadays weather is hot again, every time resting everyone is exhausted. Several faint every day. This servant just felt doing some things for them, letting them breathe a bit is good..."

Anger already appeared on Zhao Yingong's face: "So speaking, my taking them into Cihui Hall to work is torturing them instead!"

"This servant dares not!" Xihua's body trembled, yet still continued saying, "This servant also knows can't do anything, only beg Master to reduce working time here by one or two shichen—everyone really can't bear it. Continuing like this this servant fears there will be unbearable things. This servant entered that workshop myself, couldn't stay for a moment..."

Wu Zhixiang and surrounding female workers were dumbstruck one by one, faces pale. They all knew Xihua's words were true. Inside the workshop was indeed not a place for humans to stay, let alone working six shichen inside, with only one meal and a few breaks in between.

Zhao Yingong was already angered pale, sneering: "You listen, it's all my fault now."

"Dare not. This servant deserves death!" Xihua's face flushed red, trembling all over, "This servant deserves death. But what this servant said is truth!"

Zhao Yingong was angered so much his hands were shaking, saying to Wu Zhixiang: "You listen, what kind of rule is this! Come! Drag out and beat to death for me!"
