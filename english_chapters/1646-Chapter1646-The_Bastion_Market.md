# Chapter 1646 - The Bastion Market

Early next morning, the three met outside the Great East Gate. They went together towards the Great World.

They weren't rich people, unable to afford sedan chairs or rickshaws, so they could only walk. Fortunately, it was already autumn, and the weather was much cooler than in summer. The three traveled early, feeling relaxed and at ease.

The Australian Great World started construction shortly after they withdrew from under Guangzhou City.
The area along the way from Great East Gate to the Great World was originally just mudflats silted up by the river bank. Not to mention houses and fields, even decent big trees were few. Scattered among wild grass and misty smoke were some desolate graves. Since Australians came here to build the Great World three years ago, they first built a big road, connecting the Great World with Guangzhou City. Thus, before the Great World opened, the connection with Guangzhou had already been established.

The road naturally followed the Hair-people's consistent extravagant style, paved with a mixture of crushed stones and black coal cinders, wide and flat, with drainage ditches on both sides, and planted with kapok trees.

In over three years, most items that could be purchased from Guangzhou for the Great World construction site were transported on this road, and various artisans and laborers from the city also walked along this road to go to work. Residents near the Great East Gate also got used to the steam whistle calling for work at the Great World construction site every morning.

At this moment, there were already quite a few pedestrians on the big road, mostly in the same direction as them. Most were "short-clothed gang," laborers doing hard work. There were also some small peddlers selling food, carrying loads on shoulder poles or pushing carts, going to the construction site in an endless stream.

However, mixed in the flow of people were also some sedan chairs, and some looking like businessmen, riding donkeys, bringing little apprentices, slowly going towards the Great World.

Huang Binkun was suddenly startled to see quite a few people among peddlers and laborers having hair cut short. *Could it be there are also many Fake Hair-bandits here?* Looking again, these people still wore Great Ming clothing, unlike "Fake Hair-bandits," so he whispered to ask Wu Ming what was going on.

"These are all local common people. Working for Hair-people for a long time, they also learned from Australians to cut hair short." Wu Ming said, "They say it's clean and easy to manage this way."

"The government doesn't care?"

"The government thinks one less trouble is better than one more. Who is willing to offend Australians for this?"

"Truly lawless!" Huang Binkun said angrily.

Walking less than half a *li*, they saw workers inlaying long iron strips on the road surface one by one. Wu Ming said this was the Hair-people's Ox-Drawn Railway—many people had seen Hair-people using oxen to pull freight cars full of building materials walking on the road—heard that later one could sit to the Great World by the Pearl River for just a few *wen*. Besides ox-drawn freight cars, there were also small iron cars speeding on the completed road sections, flying as long as two people pressed up and down.

"This isn't an ox cart railway, it's the track for Hair-bandits' Fire Wheel Cars." Huang Binkun looked at the track under construction, saying worriedly, "Before long, Hair-bandits' small trains will be able to reach directly to the Great East Gate."

"This I must experience." Wu Ming was full of interest, "Heard their small trains don't use oxen or horses or manpower, moving by burning fire and boiling water. Never understood how it works, now I can see with my own eyes!"

Huang Binkun smiled bitterly in secret. This train was naturally an extremely useful object. Once the railway was completed, Hair-bandit troops reaching the Great East Gate would only take an instant, not to mention pulling large cannons over would be as easy as turning a hand. Rather than saying a thoroughfare to the Great World was built, it was better to say an iron chain was put around Guangzhou City's neck.

But what use was it even if he said it? The government dared not intervene, let alone these scholars of the Yuyuan Society.

The group continued forward. Walking not far, they saw a spire tower rising from the ground. Beneath the spire was an arched stone gate—according to Wu Ming, this was the main gate of the Great World.

People of the Yuyuan Society were interested in everything Australian, so naturally they wouldn't let go of this specimen right before their eyes, the Great World. Every ten days or half a month, someone from the society would always come here in company to look—Wu Ming could be counted as one of those who came here most.

" The shape of this tower seems like Red-haired people's style," Wu Ming said, "Only there is one thing I don't understand: Why is the top floor open on four sides? Someone said it's for hanging a big bell, but this tower has been built for over a year, yet no hanging bell is seen, but it's enclosed with reed mats on four sides. Don't know the explanation."

Huang Binkun, however, knew this "clock" (zhong) was not that "bell" (zhong). He shook his head and said: "Worthy Brother Wu, this clock isn't the big bell hung in temple bell and drum towers, but Australians' clock..." He pondered how to explain, "There are probably some wealthy families in Guangzhou City who also have them."

"Could it be that floor-standing Australian big clock in Young Master Liang's home?" Wu Ming was somewhat skeptical, "I've seen that clock, very novel. Only it's just the size of a wardrobe."

"Australian clocks can be big or small. Small ones can be tucked in the bosom; big ones are installed on clock towers." Huang Binkun shook his head, "There are also several such clock towers in Lingao. Chiming once every half hour (shichen - actually hour in modern sense usually). There is no clock on this clock tower, probably not made yet. This big clock is extremely difficult to make. Even in Lingao, those clock towers stood empty for several years."

"So that's it."

The three walked forward along the tracks for a while longer, and the Great World was before their eyes. The appearance of this Great World was very peculiar. Saying it was a business firm, yet the scale was grand, like a small city.

Standing on a mound by the road at this moment, they could roughly see the Great World by the river was a huge pentagon. Huang Binkun remembered seeing it in Huang Ping's math book: This was called a regular pentagon.

The length of each side was about one *li*. Huang Binkun sucked in a breath of cold air: This scale would be enough for a county seat in Hainan. Hair-bandits called this opening a business firm? Clearly it was building a city!

Huang Binkun had experienced battles and was familiar with military affairs, also understanding Australians' city defense architecture well. He saw at a glance that this Great World was exactly the same as various military forts and camps Hair-bandits built on Hainan Island: All were so-called "Bastions" (Star Forts): The stockade presented a pentagon, with a small fortress on each protruding angle. This so-called clock tower was exactly a protruding angle fortress.

What felt slightly comforting was that the two wings extending from the clock tower didn't build city walls, but two open colonnades, the military flavor not very strong. Here, apart from a part still having bamboo scaffolding, others were mostly completed. Thick stone pillars were carved with patterns in relief, appearing towering and magnificent. Through the colonnade, one could see the interior was a large square. The ground wasn't leveled yet, piled with yellow sand, stones, and various materials. A thick, ferocious black iron frame tower in the center was the topic of conversation for everyone in Guangzhou City, rich or poor, noble or base, in these years: A steam crane.

This steam crane being thick, solid, able to lift heavy objects, and rotating freely was one thing. What confused Guangzhou citizens—including the scholars of Yuyuan Society aspiring to study "Banditology"—most was: How did this tower crane grow taller by itself?

Citizens who loved watching excitement watched this iron tower machine rise from over one *zhang* high all the way to seven or eight *zhang* high as the Great World's buildings were built higher and higher.

How this crane tower was raised became a topic discussed continuously in many tea houses and restaurants in the whole city. Yuyuan Society also argued endlessly. For this, Young Master Lin even specially hired several carpenters and coppersmiths with excellent skills to go to the site to watch this machine. Only they couldn't get close to the construction area. Watching from afar several times, they couldn't make out the reason.

They could only see it was built and raised section by section. However, this tower was so high, and the iron frame of each section was so huge and heavy, obviously not dragged up by manpower or pulleys and the like. Moreover, there was a long cantilever and a small iron-framed glass house at the very top of this tower frame. Adding height layer by layer seemed completely impossible to accomplish.

At this moment they had no mood to discuss this matter, only walking into the Great World following the flow of people.

Outside the Great World construction site, there was originally a bamboo fence surrounding it from a distance. At this moment, the fence gates were all open. Road signs stood at the entrance: One side was "Labor Work," the other side was "Business Recruitment."

The group walked towards the direction of "Business Recruitment" following the road sign. Along the way, business people were crowded together. The three followed the flow of people through the colonnade, entering the large square still piled with building materials. Several people were all stunned: What kind of house is this!

They had never seen the main building before their eyes—not only Zhang and Wu who were in Guangzhou, even Huang Binkun who came from the "Hair-bandit Old Nest" hadn't seen it.

This huge building before their eyes stood in the middle of the square, built entirely of stone. On the magnificent stone outer walls were high and narrow long windows, glass shining on them. This building was not only a five-story mansion, but also every story was higher than the floors they commonly saw. The main gate of the grand building was as high as two stories, supported by stone pillars in the middle. On both sides of the high steps were a pair of stone lions with unusual appearances, ferocious faces, and wings on their ribs. Above the main gate was another clock tower. Looking carefully, this building wasn't square. Like the Great World's outer wall, it was also a regular pentagonal building. Each of the five corners had a tower. Extending from the two wings like double wings were two-story buildings, connecting all the way to the two towers of the Great World's outer wall.

"So high! Simply, simply..." Zhang Yu stammered, suddenly feeling his walnut cookie small shop was finished, coming here himself was basically a waste of effort.

"Such height is simply like a Buddhist pagoda." Wu Ming forced himself to be calm, looking up at the huge building. Ancient China rarely built multi-story buildings; the few multi-story buildings were mostly two stories. Only religious buildings like Buddhist pagodas could be called true high-rise buildings. Although some pagodas' height could be equivalent to later generations' twenty or thirty-story buildings, the floor area was small and had no practical value.

While Huang Binkun marveled, his heart suddenly sank: In Lingao, he had never seen Hair-bandits build such a magnificent building. Why build such a grand and magnificent building outside Guangzhou City sparing no cost?

Xiang Zhuang performed the sword dance, intending for Pei Gong. This so-called Great World they built was clearly a letter of war declaring war on the Imperial Court. This Great World wasn't some dazzling flowery world of Australian style, but a through-and-through impregnable pass!
