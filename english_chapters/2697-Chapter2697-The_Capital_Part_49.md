# Chapter 2697: The Capital (Part 49)

"This person has a lot of background?"

"Deep and unfathomable." Wang Yehao lowered his voice unconsciously when speaking here. "Not mentioning others, even with the Slave Chieftain [Nurhaci/Hong Taiji], he can speak words."

"To actually have such a person!" Mr. Zhou was greatly surprised.

"This Li Luoyou's ancestors were originally big households doing Liaodong business," Wang Yehao said with great interest. "With the Mongol tribes outside the pass and the Old Slave [Nurhaci] of Jianzhou, they all count as generational friends. So this business in Mongolia and Liaodong has never been broken. Nowadays he makes eyes with Shorn-hair Thieves again—it is said Shorn-hair Thieves buy many cattle and sheep skins from him every year. In the Court he also has big backers; several Grand Secretaries before and after, and Eunuchs inside the Palace all have connections with him. Ordinarily, no one dares to move him."

"If his assistance can be obtained, wouldn't the matter of opposing Thieves be smoother?"

"I also thought so. It's just this Master Li's scheming heart is deep and unfathomable. Can't read him, can't figure him out!"

"If not a friend, then an enemy..."

Master Wang and Zhou Lezhi were both greatly startled; they didn't expect the Teacher would actually say such decisive words. Looking at the Teacher's expression, these words were not a joke.

"Teacher be cautious in speech. If this Master Li really becomes enemies with us, I fear Shorn-hair Thieves will be like tigers adding wings." Wang Yehao said, "He is now wavering and undecided; although unwilling to oppose Thieves [openly?], he can still be counted as loyal and devoted to the Court..."

Returning to his own courtyard, Mr. Zhou couldn't attend to teasing Curie and Newton, plunging headlong into his study, not knowing what he was busy with.

Zhou Lezhi was ordered to meet Li Luoyou and gained much from the conversation. Returning to the Teacher's side, he reported the process from beginning to end.

"You feel what exactly is this person's attitude towards Shorn-hair Thieves?"

"En, as Teacher said, it is 'Conflicted [Jiu Jie]'."

"Conflicted? Haha, you said it well!" Mr. Zhou laughed. "Although I haven't seen him, hearing people speak of this person's deeds, I can roughly guess his mindset."

"Yes, he is incomparably disappointed with the government and Court; but asking him to assist Shorn-hair Thieves and become a meritorious official of a new dynasty, he also can't accept it." Zhou Lezhi recalled the whole meeting process. "If speaking of any true heart, that is being unwilling for barbarians like Shorn-hair Thieves and Eastern Captives to enter and master Hua Xia..."

"Barbarians? Shorn-hair Thieves are also barbarians?" Mr. Zhou seemed startled, then laughed loudly, "Correct, correct, they are indeed barbarians!"

Zhou Lezhi didn't know what exactly the Teacher found so funny—these Shorn-hair Thieves came from overseas; even if calling themselves descendants of Great Song, it was entering into barbarian lands and changing from Xia. If not barbarians, what were they?

"Speaking so, as long as a Hua Xia hero becomes Emperor, regardless of who, he doesn't care, right."

"These words he dares not say. I see his true heart is probably just like this."

"Of course he dares not say." The Teacher nodded slightly. "He differs from the Liang family."

Don't look at the Liang family earning Australians' money; inwardly they were irreconcilable with Shorn-hair Thieves. If really reaching a critical moment, destroying family to relieve national disaster wasn't impossible. The Li family was different.

"Regarding the matter of making guns and cannons, does he still have intention to do it?"

"This Li Luoyou cares most about refreshing firearms. The Court originally told Guangdong here to cast cannons, only the labor price silver given was too low. Moreover, he feels the cannons cast now are too poor, might as well get the Shorn-hair Thieves' cannon-making techniques..."

"Damn [Kao], what logic is this," Mr. Zhou cursed a sentence, then asked, "What else did he say about Shorn-hair Thieves?"

"Said Shorn-hair Thieves treat common people like children, and the Yamen talks credit... Anyway, just said many good words."

"Fart!" Mr. Zhou sniffed disdainfully, "Killing so many people in Guangdong, and casually hanging people on street lamps, yet treating common people like children!"

"Teacher quell anger; Master Li also said Shorn-hair Thieves lack Great Righteousness, blindly using petty favors to tempt ignorant common people. Matters like shaving heads and changing clothes, contrary to ethics and constants, were done countless times."

Hearing these, Mr. Zhou was surprisingly calm. He turned a few circles in the room, saying: "When you go to see him, tell him you have a Shorn-hair Thief gunnery pamphlet. Although mainly discussing gunnery, within it there are also some cannon-making techniques. If he is interested, you can gift it to him."

"Yes, Student understands." Zhou Lezhi knew this small pamphlet should be written by the Teacher. Speaking of which, the Teacher was truly an "All-talent"; understood everything, knew everything.

"He will definitely be interested; slowly fish him. I still have a few books here; wait until the timing is mature then give him."

"Student knows."

"You go." The Teacher said, "Did you finish reading the few books I asked you to read?"

"All finished reading."

"Bring the reading notes tonight; I will take a look."

The Teacher grasped Zhou Lezhi's study very tightly. Not only frequently giving him books to read, but also requiring him to write reading notes based on insights, then lecturing the next day based on book content and notes. Although study was tense, Zhou Lezhi enjoyed it.

After eating dinner at night, he took the notes to the Teacher's courtyard. Unexpectedly, before stepping into the courtyard gate, he heard a burst of clamor in the main room. Mixed within was the Teacher's angry shouting sound.

This was strange; Zhou Lezhi had followed the Teacher for many years and rarely saw him lose his temper; scolding maids and servants was even rarer. How come he was cursing people now?

Hurriedly stepping in, he saw a servant woman holding Zhou Curie fleeing from the main room in panic. The little girl still had tears in her eyes, sobbing in the servant woman's arms. Looking again, Yourong stood under the corridor of the West Wing with a face full of smugness, a servant woman holding Zhou Newton standing beside her.

Wang Zhi was under the main room corridor. Seeing Zhou Lezhi come, he hurriedly welcomed him, whispering: "You came just right! Quickly go in to persuade..."

"What happened inside?"

"It's Miss Jieyi..." Wang Zhi stopped speaking, "The Master values you most; you go persuade."

"Hmph, I fear this kind of rebellious matter can't be persuaded," Yourong said eccentrically [yin-yang weird air] under the corridor, "Still better quickly invite Family Law to beat while questioning!"

Zhou Lezhi frowned. Honestly speaking, he had no special impression of the Teacher's two concubines—towards the Teacher's women he was consistently cautious. Whether Jieyi, Yourong, or the vanished Zhiling, all were kept at a distance, respecting but staying away.

However, compared to Jieyi and Zhiling, he was somewhat disgusted with women of brothel origin like Yourong, feeling they "knew too much." After Yourong gave birth to a son, her arrogance became even more rampant, speech and conduct quite immoderate.

He pretended not to hear Yourong's words, only saying to Wang Zhi: "You just close the courtyard gate, assign people to guard. Don't alarm others in the General's Office."

"Need to immediately send people to report to the Master?"

"Temporarily no; wait until the matter subsides then say." Zhou Lezhi felt this was probably the Master's "Family Ugliness," better not to spread it out.

Coming under the main room corridor, the partition doors were wide open. On the square brick floor were smashed teapots and tea cups. Jieyi knelt prostrate on the ground, only crying blindly. The Teacher's face was flushed red, so angry his speech was incoherent.

"You... you... you, dare to dose Laozi [me/father]?! Speak! Who told you to do this!"

With a *Peng* sound, another flower vase shattered on the ground.

Zhou Lezhi's scalp went numb: Dosing! This was terrible. Originally wanting to open his mouth to persuade, now he dared not even speak.

Jieyi kowtowed on the ground like a chicken pecking broken rice: "Master clearly inspect! This bondmaid [did this] is tonic medicine ah. Master is bondmaid's Sky; how dare bondmaid deceive Sky! Bondmaid is wronged! Wronged!"

"Since it's tonic medicine, what cannot be said to me? Sneakily putting it into tea water; no wonder the tea taste wasn't right these days! What is your motive?!" The Teacher's expression was already distorted, roaring, "Come! Call Liu Sha! Isn't he from the Town-soothing Division? Beat and question for me!"

"Master spare life ah!"

Seeing Jieyi's forehead already swollen and skin broken, and no one around dared to make a sound, Zhou Lezhi had to brace his scalp to say: "Teacher..."

Mr. Zhou glanced at him once, instantly making him feel what was called "killing with eyes." Zhou Lezhi had never seen the Teacher so furious, but for the Teacher's face and family harmony, he had to force himself to speak.

"Teacher, please don't be furious. Didn't you teach me in past days not to make decisions when emotionally impulsive? Also said 'No investigation, no right to speak.' Even if Miss Jieyi has some fault, must also clarify the matter before dealing with it..."

"I saw it all! What else is there to say." Although the Teacher's voice was loud, the imposing momentum had come down. Zhou Lezhi knew there was hope, hurriedly continuing to remonstrate:

"Although seeing is believing, Miss Jieyi has served Teacher for many years and also has an emotional foundation. Teacher and she also have Curie; what motive does she have to harm Teacher? Teacher hasn't always taught me, everything must talk logic and look at motive, must investigate and study..."

With these words going up, the Teacher seemed moved. Zhou Lezhi busily signaled Wang Zhi at the door with his eyes. Wang Zhi understood and immediately poked the servant woman holding Curie.

The servant woman understood at once, immediately running into the room holding Curie, kneeling and crying: "Master! Master! Miss Jieyi has a thousand mistakes and ten thousand wrongs; beg you to look at Curie's sake, spare her..."

Curie was originally scared pale; now she wailed loudly even more. A look of helplessness filled the Teacher's face; he panted a rough breath saying: "Fine! Since so, follow what you said—investigate first!"

The servants seeing the Master loosen his mouth, hurriedly surrounded up. Some swept the floor and tidied the room, some hurriedly supported Jieyi away, some served tea water...

Zhou Lezhi just sighed a breath of relief, but heard the Teacher say: "Jieyi is not allowed to leave; I have words to ask!"

Zhou Lezhi knew if today's matter wasn't asked until water fell and stones appeared [clarified completely], the Teacher couldn't sleep. Immediately he instructed: "Everyone go busy with what you should be busy with; what excitement to watch."

Hearing the sound, servants hurriedly retreated out. Only hearing Yourong's voice from under the West Wing corridor again: "Hmph, even if speaking out, it is still..."

The Teacher grabbed a teapot, throwing it out the door water and pot together. With a crisp shattering sound, someone cried a few times in the courtyard, then it was silent and soundless.

Zhou Lezhi busily signaled Wang Zhi to close all partition doors. Turning around, he persuaded again: "Teacher don't get angry. Even if Miss Jieyi has some fault, asking clearly before dealing with it isn't too late."
