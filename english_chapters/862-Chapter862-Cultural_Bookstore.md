# Chapter 862 - Cultural Bookstore

After meeting with the newly-pledged household servants, Zhao Yingong was already calculating in his head. Based on the resources currently at his disposal, directly entering the raw silk and cocoon trade would be beyond his means. His capital was limited. Delong Bank, still not fully established locally, certainly couldn't mobilize too much funding. Finally, the capitalists of Jiangnan would definitely be far harder to deal with than those in Leizhou—not only were they well-capitalized, but most had powerful gentry and officials as backers. His situation was far more difficult than that of the Leizhou Station or the Guangzhou Station. He couldn't directly encroach on the interests of local power-holders, lest he face a powerful backlash and lose everything.

After consideration, the most suitable approach for now was to get involved in the raw silk production process. As a transmigrator, his greatest advantage was naturally using Lingao's technological capabilities to open a modernized, semi-mechanized silk-reeling factory producing high-quality raw silk. From Wang Siniang's description, traditional hand-reeling was not only inefficient but produced inferior quality. If industrial mass-production's cheap, high-quality products struck the existing market, the transformation from quantitative to qualitative change would happen quickly.

Those who would be hurt most by this would be silkworm farmers like the Shen family who raised their own silkworms and reeled their own silk. Zhao Yingong had no doubt that once a silk-reeling factory began production, the resulting shock would drive thousands upon thousands of silkworm farmers into bankruptcy, stripped of their land and property, cast onto the streets. And he would be the one who started it all.

However, such a situation was advantageous for the transmigrator collective. The Elder Council's consistent agricultural policy was to destroy small-scale production. A large, stable class of small peasant proprietors—whether owning their own land or working as tenants—was something the Elder Council did not want to see. The Elder Council needed large quantities of freely hireable labor.

Besides silk-reeling, intensive sericulture and mulberry cultivation also had great potential. Zhao Yingong had witnessed the explosion of productivity that the Agricultural Committee's farming improvements and agricultural extension work had brought to Lingao. If similar methods were introduced to Hangzhou, mulberry leaf and cocoon yields and quality could certainly be greatly improved.

However, both of these approaches depended on Lingao's technology and material support. Zhao Yingong himself knew absolutely nothing about silk-reeling machines or sericulture. He decided to use his old method—first go conduct a field inspection.

He had already made up his mind to open a silk-reeling factory, but doing so would require solving a series of problems: land, factory buildings, equipment, workers, and raw material sources.

The silk-reeling factory's technical requirements were limited. Having the machinery factory replicate late 19th-century reeling equipment wouldn't be too difficult. The factory also wouldn't need much power equipment—a steam engine wasn't necessary; a water wheel would suffice. When Zhao Yingong had originally designed his "transmigrator textile industry," he had already considered water-wheel power.

To establish a factory and use water-wheel power, he would need land. This land had to be large enough, with a river nearby—both mulberry cultivation and silk-reeling factories required substantial water sources. To meet these conditions, inside Hangzhou city clearly wouldn't work. He needed to look outside the city walls.

Zhao Yingong had long had a particular piece of land in mind—he had set his sights on Phoenix Mountain outside Fengshan Gate. This was where the Southern Song imperial palace had been located. During the Song and Yuan dynasties, it had been inside the city walls. When Zhang Shicheng built Hangzhou's new city walls at the end of the Yuan, Phoenix Mountain was left outside. In the fourteenth year of Zhiyuan, the Southern Song imperial palace on Phoenix Mountain suffered a fire that destroyed most of it. Ten years later, Yang Lianzhenji petitioned the Yuan court and used the foundation, remaining structures, and building materials of the Song palace to construct five Buddhist temples on Phoenix Mountain. These five temples also fell into ruin during the Yuan dynasty and were completely destroyed in the wars at the end of the Yuan. By the late Ming, Phoenix Mountain had become a desolate, uninhabited wasteland. Zhao Yingong had already made inquiries—though this place was close to the city walls, it was extremely deserted. Aside from a few small villages, there was almost no population.

But for Zhao Yingong, this location was quite suitable. Wasteland meant low land prices, meeting his current limited financial conditions. Since it had been able to support palace construction, the terrain couldn't be too rugged—it must be relatively flat sloping land. Besides building structures, the slopes could also support large-scale mulberry tree planting, providing leaves for the sericulture operation. Phoenix Mountain bordered the Central River on one side and the Qiantang River on the other, making it convenient to channel water for power or for production and daily use. If more factories were to be built in the future, water access and drainage would be nearby.

The future Hangzhou Station would also need to handle population transfers—setting up a purification camp in his own residence would be quite inappropriate. First, there wasn't enough space. Second, this was an upscale residential area inside the city; large numbers of poor people entering and leaving Zhao residence would attract far too much attention. Phoenix Mountain was a place close to the city yet unobtrusive.

Finally, Phoenix Mountain bordered the Qiantang River and was a commanding height overlooking Fengshan Gate. When the Taiping Army attacked Hangzhou, they had seized this location as an important staging base. Controlling this place was equivalent to preparing a suitable dock for transferring refugees and receiving naval vessels. For Zhao Yingong, who styled himself a descendant of the Song imperial house, Phoenix Mountain also held special political significance. This high ground was one he absolutely had to secure.

Of course, the entire ruins of Phoenix Mountain's palace grounds—stretching from Shaozhouwan in the south to Wansong Ridge in the north, along the western bank of the Central River's southern end in the east, to the eastern foot of Phoenix Mountain in the west—had a circumference of nine *li*. Such a vast area was neither within Zhao Yingong's means nor necessary to purchase in its entirety. After all, he was here to establish industries, not create a Southern Song palace ruins park for his own nostalgic contemplation. He immediately instructed Cai Shi and Sun Wangcai to first inquire locally about land ownership around Phoenix Mountain and rough land prices, while also surveying "locations suitable for establishing an estate."

He then drafted a telegram, reporting his ideas and plans in full to the External Intelligence Bureau, including all the support he hoped to receive: funds, machinery and equipment, and specialized technical personnel.

While waiting for a reply, Zhao Yingong searched for other business opportunities—not only for profit, but also with the intention of finding ways to break into local social circles.

He had considered opening a printing press. Movable type printing and lithographic printing were among the transmigrator collective's most readily profitable technologies. Not to mention they possessed vast resources available for "plagiarism." In particular, there were many texts that had been carefully collated in the old time-space. These editions, reproduced in large quantities, would surpass ordinary books sold in local bookshops in content quality alone—to say nothing of the printing quality itself.

Jiangnan's woodblock printing industry was famous at the time. This was closely connected to Jiangnan's flourishing literary culture. Nanjing, Suzhou, and Hangzhou all had large-scale bookshops that integrated editing, publishing, printing, and sales, forming a considerable industry. So there was absolutely no shortage of market.

Moreover, books were after all considered "elegant objects" in the thinking of the time. Books were connected to scholars. In a society where knowledge was monopolized by a few, books had not only practical value but also cultural and psychological significance. Thus bookshop owners who printed, edited, and sold books seemed relatively "refined," making it easier to be "looked upon favorably" when dealing with literati.

But printing presses also required equipment, technology, and personnel. At present, only Lingao had these. As far as Zhao Yingong knew, the problem of carving type dies for casting movable type in movable type printing still hadn't been satisfactorily solved. For this reason, before departure, the head of the printing office had specifically asked him to watch for any master woodblock carvers in Jiangnan who might be recruited to work in Lingao. Good woodblock workers might also be able to carve type dies.

Thinking of this, Zhao Yingong couldn't help but smile bitterly—it seemed that it really was difficult for one person alone to accomplish things. Solo time-traveling was indeed very challenging.

However, opening a bookshop was far less difficult. Zhao Yingong realized that even without movable type printing, directly using woodblock printing was perfectly acceptable. This was established technology locally—in modern terms, the entire industry chain was complete. Whether woodblock materials, printing paper, or woodblock workers—everything was readily available. He only needed to invest.

Simply opening a bookshop was still a merchant's endeavor. Literati might at most "look upon it favorably" but wouldn't truly treat him as an equal. He needed to do something more refined. Zhao Yingong suddenly thought of the so-called "cultural bookstores" in the old time-space—those with tea seating or coffee bars where customers could browse books freely, have a cup of tea and flip through books, and leave without buying. The owner just made money on the tea... Everyone thought it terribly elegant and artistic. What if this concept were introduced to the Great Ming?

Thinking further, this bookshop should have as many books as possible, creating a library atmosphere. Besides the classics, histories, philosophers, and collected works, he could also introduce some so-called "Australian books" printed in Lingao. These books, in printing quality, paper, and content, were far superior to books from this time-space. They could serve as "curiosities" to attract readers—any business needed a "selling point."

Besides books, he thought he could also sell Australian paper, stationery, and other small items. This would help distinguish his shop from ordinary bookshops, avoiding direct competition for regular bookshop business. He could also set up a membership-based lending system, allowing readers to borrow books free to read at home. Through the member registration process, he could also survey the local network of acquaintances. Of course, the greatest benefit was "reputation." In ancient times, books were rare and precious—not only were there few types, but prices were extremely high. An ordinary poor scholar typically had only a few volumes of the Four Books and Five Classics and the essential examination essay collections. To read more books, one had to borrow from others everywhere. Especially for major multiple-volume works or rare books, one had to seek out people with private libraries to have any chance of borrowing. Precisely because books were scarce, people with books were generally unwilling to lend easily, often requiring much pleading and requests for introductions. Thus in ancient China, countless stories, anecdotes, and legends had developed around book collecting and borrowing.
