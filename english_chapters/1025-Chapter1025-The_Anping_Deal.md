# Chapter 1025 The Anping Deal

While Zheng Zhilong and the Dutch entered alert status, a double-masted guangchuan common to the South China Sea was slowly entering Weizhou Bay. The ship was in excellent condition—tung oil on the planking gleamed and sparkled, and the yards and canvas on both sails were complete as new, presenting a clean, crisp appearance.

The sailors on board all wore uniforms of indigo blue cloth—the sailor uniforms of Great Wave Shipping. At the stern flew a Great Wave Shipping company flag: three wave patterns topped with the Morning Star.

The ship rode heavy in the water, obviously fully loaded with cargo. In this not-so-peaceful coastal region, such a cargo ship would attract many covetous eyes, but the black muzzles of several cannons on deck were enough to dispel many people's delusions. Large fishing nets hung along both sides to prevent boarding.

However, the cannons on board were all covered with gun covers—indicating peaceful intent. After the ship entered the harbor, it anchored in the bay's deep water. Several small Zheng family boats quickly approached. A minor leader boarded the deck of Great Wave Shipping's *Wenchang*.

After briefly conversing with people on deck, he hurriedly climbed back down the rope ladder from the gunwale. The small boat hurriedly turned about and rowed toward Anping city.

Half a *shichen* later, Lin Baiguang was already seated in the Xiaosi Hall of Zheng Zhilong's private residence.

Handsome boy servants had already brought fresh tea. Without even drinking, just from the fragrance, Lin Baiguang knew this was top-grade Da Hong Pao—back when he worked at the county office, a leader was very fond of tea, and he had once gone to Wuyi Mountain to buy some.

Meeting Zheng Zhilong certainly had some risk, but Lin Baiguang and others all believed the possibility of personal danger was very small: The two sides hadn't entered a hostile state. Moreover, with the Senate's current strength, any power would have to consider the consequences before initiating hostile action.

Zheng Zhilong, who was facing off against Liu Xiang, absolutely wouldn't do anything stupid.

The fact that Zheng Zhilong was willing to offer Da Hong Pao to guests increased the prospects for this trip considerably.

However, the one who came out to meet guests wasn't Zheng Zhilong, but his brother Zheng Hongkui.

Thus the representatives of the two great maritime powers of the South China Sea, or rather all of East Asian waters, met. Whether history's wheel had rolled forward another revolution was unknown, but both harbored intense curiosity about the other.

Lin Baiguang noticed the other party was a young man—absurdly young. Zheng Hongkui was several years younger than Zheng Zhilong. The Senate itself was a group of young people, but in the Great Ming, anyone of any status was almost always middle-aged or older.

Zheng Hongkui sized up this Australian envoy—he had long heard of him. Although the Zheng brothers, since accepting amnesty, had been struggling through storms almost daily with no time for other concerns, various Australian goods famed for their ingenuity had also continuously flowed into their hands, leaving deep impressions.

The opponent had leaped from an obscure small group holed up in a corner to become a maritime power controlling the Pearl River mouth and dominating most of Guangdong's waters. Their greatest rival Liu Xiang's departure from the Pearl River mouth heading north, while partly considering competition for Japan trade, was obviously also due to wariness of the Australians' expanding power.

The man before him wore a square hat, a long straight gown, and cloth-soled shoes—at first glance looking like a prosperous local merchant, only with dark skin and a lean build.

Since the other party was now voluntarily visiting them as "hosts," the Zheng family had to receive them courteously. This was the tone eldest brother had set—Zheng Zhilong didn't want to needlessly provoke a new opponent.

Zheng Hongkui waited until he set down his teacup before asking: "Sir graces us with this visit—may I ask what instruction you bring?"

Dialogue between strong parties needed no pleasantries, nor roundabout probing. Lin Baiguang smiled slightly: "There's a big business deal. I wonder if General Zheng would be interested?"

Zheng Hongkui was immediately interested. The other party wanted to do business with them! The Zheng family were major maritime merchants, involved in all manner of seaborne trade. They rather envied how sought-after Australian goods were.

Now the Australians were actively requesting cooperation—obviously recognition of their influence in Fujian.

With such intentions, the Australians currently wouldn't have any hostility.

Of course, Zheng Hongkui's thinking wasn't this simple. In history and reality, there were countless cases of using various friendly gestures to lull opponents, then suddenly attacking them to death. The Australians landing in Taiwan was already "dancing with swords"—at this critical moment, extending friendship would make anyone suspicious who wasn't absurdly overconfident.

So he replied slowly: "May I ask what business?"

Lin Baiguang beckoned. From outside the door came an attending servant carrying several small bags.

Zheng Hongkui opened one with curiosity: Inside was snow-white powder, faintly lustrous.

He started, then immediately understood: "This is salt!"

Taking a little to taste, the flavor was pure, with a slight sweet aftertaste, without any bitter strange taste. It was indeed excellent salt! Comparable to the expensive Sichuan well salt used in the mansion.

"Correct, it is salt." Lin Baiguang nodded.

Zheng Hongkui opened all the small bags one by one. All contained salt, but with different coarseness and color—probably different grades.

So the Australians wanted to sell contraband salt!

Zheng Hongkui thought about it and felt it was normal—the territory currently within their reach, from Hainan to the north, had many salt fields. Getting some salt wasn't a problem. Guangdong wasn't a salt-deficient province, so contraband salt probably didn't sell well there.

Fujian, however, was a salt-deficient place. The entire province's salt supply depended on imports from outside, especially from Guangdong and Zhejiang. Fujian neither produced salt nor was easy to traverse, being a mountainous province. Thus Fujian had the highest official salt prices in the nation, and contraband salt trade was rampant.

So far, the Zheng family hadn't put salt trading on their agenda. Yet the Australians had directly come to propose contraband salt trade! The enormous profits involved made it hard for Zheng Hongkui to refuse.

The Executive Committee decided to sell salt to Zheng Zhilong for multiple considerations: First, to relax the opponent's vigilance and avoid accidental conflict due to tensions. Second, to use northbound ships' empty cargo capacity to generate profit. Salt was now the most abundant resource under the Senate's control, with extremely low costs due to mass production. As long as it could be sold, even one tael of silver per *shi* of salt was profitable—those cargo spaces would otherwise be empty anyway.

"Quote him a price he can't refuse." Syked said when discussing this with Lin Baiguang. Salt's profits in this dimension could make people risk breaking the law or even execution. And the Zheng family, as coastal region hegemons, faced no risk in such trade. Syked believed: They could hardly resist such temptation.

If one summarized all of Zheng Zhilong's actions from his rise under Li Dan to his final capture by the Manchus, one could see he was a typical merchant who habitually thought with a merchant's mind, measuring everything by profit.

As long as the Senate could give him sufficient benefits, gaining his temporary cooperation or tacit acceptance wasn't a problem.

This business was also a "win-win" situation, not only beneficial to their side, but also useful for reducing Zheng Zhilong's wariness—if benefits given were too great, Zheng Zhilong would inevitably suspect their motives.

Zheng Hongkui hesitated greatly. Normally, they should keep the Australians at respectful distance. But the terms the other party now offered were hard to refuse. For a moment, he didn't know how to respond.

"This matter—Third Master will naturally need to discuss with General Zheng." Lin Baiguang smiled. "I'll visit again another day." He rose to leave.

This further seized the initiative. Zheng Hongkui felt somewhat at a loss. His original idea of making small talk and drawing out information had to be set aside. He immediately had people escort Lin Baiguang's party to the guesthouse and give them good hospitality. At the same time, he had fresh fruits and vegetables sent to the sailors on *Wenchang*.

Then he immediately took the samples Lin Baiguang had brought and went to see his elder brother.

Zheng Zhilong stood with arms crossed, listened to Zheng Hongkui's account, and after a long while finally said: "Interesting."

The Australians' move puzzled him considerably. If it was merely to sell contraband salt, why suddenly land in Taiwan? If saying it was to use as a salt transit station, that was too exaggerated—Fujian's salt consumption hadn't reached the point of needing a transit station for salt storage. Taking a step back, even if a transit station were truly needed, Taiwan wasn't a suitable location.

The Australians' move in Taiwan made him both puzzled and uneasy—a thorn in his back. He always felt it must contain some conspiracy.

But no matter how suspicious his heart was, he faced a choice: Either refuse cooperation and ignore the Australians' existence; or immediately take armed action to drive out the Australians; or finally, choose cooperation and make big money in the contraband salt trade.

If he chose one or three, he would have to watch the Australians' presence in Taiwan. If he wanted to drive them out, force was necessary—the Australians, having gone to great lengths to send a fleet to Taiwan and built fortresses, absolutely wouldn't easily withdraw. A few threatening words from his side certainly wouldn't drive them away.

Choosing force—the Zheng family had no certainty of winning, not to mention Liu Xiang watching covetously from the side.

What choice to make between one and three wasn't hard to guess for anyone who understood his thinking mode: Since the Australians couldn't be driven away, why not happily do business and make money?

Taking a step back, Taiwan currently wasn't his territory anyway—it was the Dutch's. The Dutch would worry about the Australians' presence even more than he would. If there was to be action, better let the Dutch take it. If the Australians truly had designs on Taiwan, then as their influence in Taiwan expanded, they would sooner or later conflict with the Dutch.

At that time, entering the battlefield as an ally of the Dutch or the Australians would be much more advantageous than now.

"This deal can be done." Zheng Zhilong made the final decision.
