# Chapter 2713: The Capital (Part 65)

The arrow flew parallel to the ground, maintaining its forward momentum.

The bowstring was drawn to the ear, the fletching paused by the corner of the mouth—"mouth holding the feather flower, ear listening to the string."

Eyes stared straight ahead, aiming with the arrowhead.

Traditional bows had no sights; archers used the arrowhead or a point on the bow limb as a reference for aiming.

Liu Chang narrowed his eyes slightly. In his vision, the arrowhead was solid while the target was blurred. Based on his daily practice and feel, the aim point was too high. He adjusted the envisioned impact point, shifting his aim downward.

Without a thumb ring, at the moment of release, the friction between the string and fingers would exacerbate string vibration, disturbing the stability of flight and lowering accuracy.

The bone thumb ring was smooth, creating low friction and little disturbance. The release was crisp and clean, increasing accuracy.

Liu Chang's thumb and index finger relaxed naturally, and the bowstring slid off the thumb ring.

After releasing the string, his drawing hand swung backward naturally with the momentum.

At the sound of the bowstring, the arrow slipped away like a swimming fish.

It was a good arrow with eagle fletching. The shaft twisted as it flew, its posture stable.

The arrow left the string. In his heart, he expected a hit; where it hit was up to fate.

The archer opposite swayed; an arrow shaft was inserted in his throat.

Hit by the arrow, the enemy's hands lost strength. The bow and arrow in his hands went out of control. The arrow flew off, shooting diagonally into the sky—not high, falling powerlessly.

The archer fell to the ground, legs kicking, hands scratching the earth in a final death struggle.

One step ahead of the enemy, a hair's breadth difference between life and death.

Seeing his companion fall, the second archer immediately turned and shot an arrow back.

Disturbed by his companion's injury, the enemy's shot was slightly off.

The enemy arrow grazed past Liu Chang's face, the whistle passing his ear. Liu Chang's heart was like an ancient well with no waves, unmoved.

Liu Chang took three arrows from his quiver, holding them in his front hand.

Holding arrows in the front hand, using the "Jade Maiden Shuttling" style, was a rapid-fire method.

Pushing the back, drawing the bow, rapid continuous shooting.

Sharp arrow energy, horn bow singing, the wind sobbing, arrow lights turning into starlight.

The first arrow hit the leg. The enemy dropped his bow, dragging the injured leg to flee.

The second arrow hit the back. The arrowhead entered from the back, piercing the chest. The enemy fell.

The third arrow hit the back again. The two arrows clustered front and back, shafts almost sticking together. The enemy twitched, and in a moment, was silent.

Old Feng, holding a short gun, advanced with the Mandarin Duck Formation. An enemy suddenly attacked from the side.

Old Feng let him get within two meters, held the gun with both hands, and knocked him down with one shot.

The gun flame flashed like a torch, and the report was heavy as a drum, stealing away the bandits' three souls and six spirits.

Roving bandits were a rabble, seeking victory in one decisive rush. Once the battle turned unfavorable and morale wavered, they had no heart for prolonged fighting and collapsed immediately.

As if hearing a starting gun, the remaining men's mental state collapsed. Losing all will to fight, they shouted and fled in all directions.

Seeing the enemies fleeing, a commotion rose in the Mandarin Duck Formation.

Zhao Liangjian shouted loudly: "Do not pursue poor bandits! Do not disorder the formation! Stabilize the line, let them flee for their lives."

Martial Yama knew the situation was hopeless. He turned to run, but his knee flared with pain—he had been hit by an arrow. *Plop*, he fell to his knees.

Looking back, he saw a sturdy man standing sideways in the distance, holding a bow aimed at him.

Martial Yama gritted his teeth and forced himself up. The arrow shaft in his knee swayed, causing the arrowhead to tremble. His knee couldn't support him, and he fell to his knees a second time.

Pain in his shoulder—another arrow hit.

Martial Yama dropped his saber, broke the shafts of the arrows in his two wounds with his bare hands, and walked with difficulty, limping. After running a distance, his breathing became ragged, his lungs burned, his injured leg seemed about to break, and the world in his eyes grew blurry. The sound of wind came from behind his head. *Bang*, a blow, and he lost consciousness.

When Martial Yama woke up, he was bound, his lungs still burning with pain.

He looked at the main road. The corpses were gone, surely dragged into the woods to be hidden. He turned his face and saw a guard beside him tilting a water skin, clear water flowing out.

A charming woman bent over in front of him, lathering soap, scooping a handful of clear water to wash the blood from her hands and face.

Martial Yama's throat gurgled. He swallowed a mouth of saliva with difficulty to moisten his cracked throat.

Hearing the sound, the woman turned to look at him and said, "Pity, you woke up late. We don't need you to speak anymore; your companions have confessed everything."

Martial Yama saw the two leading men behind the woman, clearly the bosses. He asked, "How about my brothers in the woods? Why didn't they charge out?"

The woman took a towel handed by Old Feng, wiped her hands, and smiled. "That group has already been completely killed by me."

Martial Yama was startled. He looked at the woman and asked, "May I ask your great name?"

The woman said, "I am Liao Sanniang."

Martial Yama nodded and said stiffly, "Good. Knowing whose hands I died in, I can be a ghost with understanding."

Liao Sanniang wore a brimming smile and asked, "Won't you beg for mercy? Perhaps I'll spare your life."

Martial Yama spat on the ground and said, "The world is in decline, violent and evil; it's hard for people to find peace. This life has been useless—couldn't become an official, and even as a bandit, couldn't become a great fierce rebel. Eating grass roots and floating mud, living is boring. I've killed enough in this life, already worth it. Why beg like a convex pus bag? Besides..."

At this point, Martial Yama glanced at Liao Sanniang. "You definitely won't spare me."

Liao Sanniang raised her eyebrows slightly. "How so?"

Martial Yama sneered, "Hehe. Your eyes hold ruthlessness (*liqi*), and the corners of your mouth have killing lines. You are like me, both vicious tigers, always wanting to eat people. Saying this is just a cat playing with a mouse. I ask one thing before death: use my sword to cut off my head."

Liao Sanniang stared at Martial Yama. The smile lines at the corners of her mouth slowly retracted, her expression turning cold. After a while, she said, "A blood feud is settled between us. Letting you go back would make this route unsafe in the future, only adding trouble. To eliminate evil, one must pull up the root. I'll fulfill your wish. Brother Liu, trouble you to send him on his way."

Liu Chang nodded, picked up Martial Yama's long saber from the ground, and with a guard, dragged Martial Yama into the woods.

A bit away from the main road, Liu Chang saw a huge basin-like pit ahead, suitable for dumping corpses. He and the guard dragged him to the edge of the pit and pressed Martial Yama down to kneel.

Kneeling by the pit, Martial Yama raised his head and said to Liu Chang, "If it were a foot battle with sabers, I would definitely beat you. Pity my martial arts couldn't be displayed. Just now, I should have been the one to go up and fight."

Liu Chang said, "I can draw a heavy hard bow; my waist and back are tough. I wouldn't necessarily crash to you in a saber fight. No matter who came up, it would be in vain. Our martial arts, formation, and equipment are all above yours. Even with twenty more men, you aren't our match."

Martial Yama looked at Liu Chang, snorted coldly, and said, "The Mandarin Duck Formation you use was created by Guardian Qi (*Qi Shaobao*). It's a military formation, most effective against roving soldiers. I'm a deserter; losing to the Mandarin Duck Formation is like being executed by military law. I die without injustice."

Liu Chang looked around. Suddenly, he saw two half-rotted skeletons at the bottom of the big pit. The skeletons were covered in grass and mud, their eye sockets deep and terrifying.

Liu Chang was stunned seeing them.

Seeing Liu Chang's strange expression, Martial Yama followed his gaze. Seeing the two skeletons, he was stunned at first, then laughed crazily.

Liu Chang looked at him strangely and asked, "What are you laughing at?"

Martial Yama said, "Those two skeletons are the daughters of a retired official. We robbed their family some time ago. After raping and playing with the two girls, we killed them. It was very enjoyable. Afterwards, we cut off their heads and threw them here. I had long forgotten. I didn't expect to meet them again at the brink of death. It's an ill-fated affinity (*nieyuan*)."

Liu Chang frowned. "The dead haven't gone far; retribution is unfailing. The Way of Heaven claims lives; just right to use your head to sacrifice to the wronged souls."

Martial Yama glared ferociously at Liu Chang. "In eighteen years, I'll be reborn as a bandit again to rob and kill you lot."

Liu Chang cracked a mocking grin. "Good. At that time, I'll kill you again."

After speaking, Liu Chang lifted the long saber in his hand, inspected it, and flicked the blade with his middle finger. *Ding*, a clear and melodious sound.

Martial Yama turned his face and said, "I sharpened this knife all day yesterday; it's very sharp."

Liu Chang said, "Sending you off well."

Martial Yama chuckled, "No need. Chop a few more times, let me savor the taste of death in detail."

Liu Chang shook his head. "I don't wish to torture others. My hand is steady; I guarantee it will be quick."

Martial Yama chuckled. "Alright, trouble you."

On Martial Yama's mud-covered neck, there was a flesh-white neck crease, like a marker line, blindingly white—the "beheading line."

Liu Chang rubbed Martial Yama's neck with his left thumb, making the beheading line clear. His fingertips felt the clear joints.

Sure enough, as Martial Yama said, once the condemned man's neck was rubbed, his neck stiffened immediately, stretching straight to accept the blade.

The long saber waved. The angle of the edge matched the trajectory of the swing. The sound of the blade was sharp. The cutting line perfectly overlapped the beheading line.

The head fell. The cross-section of the neck was smooth and flat. A jet of fresh blood spurted from the neck cavity. The head rolled down the slope of the pit edge to the bottom.

The head rolled, stained with crushed leaves and mud. Vaguely, the mouth moved twice, seemingly saying: "Good knife."

Martial Yama's head rolled to the bottom of the pit, colliding with the two skeletons, gathering into a triangle shape.

Looking at the three skulls at the bottom of the pit, Liu Chang chanted silently: *Not human, not ghost; separation and chaos are miserable; life and death are impermanent. May the chaotic world end, protect you all, and may you all be people of peace in the next life.*

Liu Chang kicked the headless corpse into the pit. Just as he lifted the saber to leave, a wisp of yin wind blew by his feet, making him cold.

Liu Chang stopped and thought. He turned back to the pit edge, thrust the long saber into the earth with a *cha*, and said, "Your knife, returned to you."

Then he left the woods.

Little Bazi looked into the woods and asked, "Those corpses..."

Old Feng interjected, "Every day in the Capital, more street corpses and starved bodies are hauled to Zuojiazhuang by cart than this. These roving bandits have no *Baojia* or village registration; no one looks for them, no one cares. If someone is kind enough to collect them, it's their luck; otherwise, heaven and earth will take them."

Pausing briefly, Old Feng added, "Not a single man lost. Good luck."

"What did the captives confess?" Sanniang asked casually.

"There's a piece of news," Old Feng's eyes flashed. "I'll explain in detail at the estate. Should we bring them along to question further?"

"No need," Liao Sanniang said. "These small fry won't know the key joints. Behead them all."

Old Feng turned back into the woods.

Seeing Little Bazi looking at her with a hint of fear in his eyes, Liao Sanniang asked, "What? Blaming me for being cruel?"

Little Bazi shook his head. "If a person isn't ruthless, it's hard to establish oneself. Living is hard to begin with."

Liao Sanniang fished out a copper coin. Flicking it with her thumb, she sent it flying far away and asked, "Guess which side is up? Words or back?"
