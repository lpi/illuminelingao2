# Chapter 152: Armstrong Cannon

Projectile flew past the 400m mound, smashing a 30cm-deep crater. Iron ball in the pit still smoked.

"Ground here is fairly soft." Lin Shenhe observed. "Harder ground would produce ricochet effect—even more devastating."

Zhang Bailin measured: from 400m stake to crater—actual distance was 460m.

"Range acceptable." Lin Shenhe was satisfied. "Accuracy's also acceptable."

"This is acceptable? Hit nothing!" Ying Yu found it unbelievable. This is a cannon—direct fire too.

"Correct—smoothbores have this level. Against dense formations, one shot kills at least a dozen."

They continued firing with different angles and charges—over a dozen rounds. Range from 400m to 1200m+. At maximum 45-degree elevation, projectiles reached 1500m. Beyond 400m, accuracy disappeared—basically just general direction. Throughout the process, 4 mounds were hit. The cannon became red-hot—but remained stable without cracking. For safety, after 15 shots, Lin Shenhe called cease-fire—switch cannons.

"More firing? I'm nearly collapsed." Artillerymen were gasping. Everything else was manageable—after each shot, repositioning was exhausting. Then readjusting direction and angle. Extreme physical drain.

"We still need recoil cannons—otherwise we'll die from exhaustion." Zhang Bailin wheezed, nearly collapsing.

"Recoil guns need Industrial Department to produce springs first." Lin Shenhe was also exhausted. "Until then—don't think about it."

After resting, they test-fired the clay-mold-cast cannon. Range was slightly shorter than iron-mold versions. Performance was also acceptable.

Subsequently, Artillery Group used iron-mold plus Rodman method to cast 12-pounder howitzers, 12-pounder mountain howitzers, 12-pounder cannons, and other calibers. With light cannon experience, they began casting naval 32-pounder cannons and 32-pounder carronades (note: short direct-fire guns invented by British Navy). These various cannons all test-fired successfully. Lingao Point area had daily cannon thunder, smoke-filled skies.

With sufficient casting experience, Artillery Group—using resource library's Armstrong cannon drawings and explanations—designed an improved screw-breechblock Armstrong cannon.

Rifled cannons weren't smoothbores. Though 32-pounder long-gun caliber reached 120mm during casting, designers cautiously set the first Armstrong at 70mm caliber.

Barrel material: cast steel. Casting was now routine for Artillery Group. Main issue: rifling. In arsenals, this required specialized machinery—at least specialized tooling. Immediate manufacturing was impossible. Fortunately, transmigrators had role models: Eighth Route and New Fourth Army ordnance workers. With simplest machinery and hand tools, they'd made rifles and cannons. Researching archives, Zhan Wuya decided to imitate Wu Yunduo's soil-method rifling technique: an olive-shaped steel column with spiral grooves around circumference, force-wedged into barrel.

How to make this column—Wu Yunduo only described generally, no detailed drawings. Artillery Group convened all machinery and drafting experts for overnight discussion—producing design drawings. Jiang Ye supervised: first sand casting, then lathe machining the steel die.

Finally, this extrusion method proved effective. Days later, first Armstrong barrel was machined. Breechblock was trickier—but through Jiang Ye and Xiao Bailang's joint efforts, screw-breechblock was completed and successfully installed. Assembled and polished, the cannon looked sleek and smooth. Everyone fondled and admired it with lecherous expressions.

Shells used cast-iron long pointed solid shot. But rifled-cannon fuzes were problematic.

Fuzes—whether safety-equipped or not—were basically spring and striker type. Requiring two things: primers and springs. Compared to primer's fulminate of mercury, springs were actually their bigger problem. Spring manufacturing itself wasn't difficult—materials were. Modern springs used alloy steel—not producible with small converters. Mechanical Group had spring steel reserves—but shell fuzes were consumables; couldn't rely on reserves.

"How about chemical fuzes?" Zhang Bailin had a brainstorm.

"Meaning?"

"Chemical reactions to detonate shells." Zhang Bailin's idea was simple: glass or ceramic vials containing one chemical, surrounded by another reactive chemical. On impact, vial shatters, chemicals mix violently, detonating the explosive.

"Not very safe." Xiao Bailang said. "Shells constantly get moved and transported. What if vials break?"

"Separate transport. Fuze and shell separate—install before use."

Wang Luobin shook his head repeatedly: "Concept's fine, but you forgot: rifled-breechloader chamber pressure is much higher than smoothbores. Fuzes need sufficient strength. Glass tubes would shatter at firing—result: burst barrel."

Zhang Bailin was dumbfounded—he hadn't considered this.

"Cannons aren't as easy as imagined, huh?" Ying Yu patted his shoulder.

"This fuze could work for other explosives—" Lin Shenhe said, "but absolutely not shells."

"So advanced cannons aren't enough." Wang Luobin smiled bitterly. Smoothbore HE shells had no technical difficulty—but that technology couldn't apply to rifled guns.

"Carbon steel can also make springs." Jiang Ye thought—recalling seeing carbon steel springs somewhere.

"Can work—0.6% carbon steel is usable. Just unknown if performance suffices." Ji Wusheng said. "Worth trying—I'll research heat treatment."

"Can you handle heat treatment?" Zhan Wuya was also uncertain—he'd only done simple heat treatment work.

"I'm not sure either—only books and experiments."

"This won't be simple—not one or two day work."

After much fruitless thinking, Lin Shenhe finally proposed: since initial Armstrong deployment was naval—anti-ship still prioritized armor-piercing. Solid cast-iron shot would suffice.

"What about shore bombardment missions?"

"Use mortars." Lin Shenhe said.

Mortars were predecessors of modern mortars—manufacturing was much simpler. Accompanying HE shells were easy to make. Downside: high dud rate—better than nothing.

"How to solve lead coating problem?" Wang Luobin asked. Historically, Armstrong cannons were removed from Royal Navy ships because lead fragments flying at muzzle exit caused casualties.

"I read that someone proposed electroplating lead would solve this—" Wang Luobin shared his solution idea.

Early rifled-cannon shells used Minié ball type technology—explosive gas expanding shell bases into rifling. Shell bodies needed soft metal coating—lead was ideal. Problem followed: cast-iron bodies and lead skins bonded poorly. Without hydraulic presses, forced bonding resulted in Royal Navy Armstrong style lead fragment injuries.

"Electroplating is currently too extravagant—technically insufficient too." Zhan Wuya said.

"One idea—might work. Americans used it on 3-inch Shenkl cannon shells."

Since lead skin falling off injured people, and they couldn't prevent it—best solution: substitute something that wouldn't injure when falling.

Shenkl shells used papier-mâché driving bands on shell bases—paper-pulp mixture. Sufficient strength and flexibility for rifling engagement, but shattered fragments at muzzle exit wouldn't injure.

"Is this paper pulp difficult?"

"1860s technology—shouldn't be hard. Just paper pulp and glue. No ready formulas—experiments needed."

"Assign to Chemistry Group—they have experience with this."

Mid-discussion, Military Group's He Ming suddenly burst in, face serious.

"What happened?" Wang Luobin sensed trouble.

"According to prisoner confessions—pirates will likely attack us soon!" He handed over a document. "This is Security Group's interrogation bulletin."
