# Chapter 1276: Evening Leisure

Locking up the confidential memorandum, Huang Dashan happened to call: the test results for the dead chicks sent for inspection yesterday were out.

"The culture results from the specimens sent show no avian influenza or other pathogens found." Huang Dashan said on the phone, "Epidemic infection can be basically ruled out."

"That's great." Wu Nanhai had been worried about this matter. Hearing it wasn't a disease outbreak, he felt much relieved, "However, I still have to go to the brooding house to take a look. This mortality rate is a bit abnormally high."

"It's good for you to go take a look. If you're not reassured, bring back a few more samples. If there are secretions, take samples of those too. I'll do another culture experiment."

"Okay." Wu Nanhai put down the phone and decided to visit the brooding house personally.

"Ashui, take me to the brooding house." Wu Nanhai came to the courtyard and called out to Liu Ashui, who was pushing a cart delivering thermos bottles to various offices—Liu Ashui, besides pulling the rickshaw for him, also worked as a handyman for the Agricultural Committee when not pulling the rickshaw.

Liu Ashui hurriedly handed the handcart to another handyman and went to pull out the rickshaw himself. Looking at the sky, he set up the canvas canopy again.

Wu Nanhai rode the rickshaw all the way to the farm's brooding house. The reports in recent days showed that the number of chick deaths was abnormal, more than 30% higher than usual. Coupled with the chicken plague not long ago, he was very worried about this: even in the old spacetime with complete medicines, the handling of avian influenza was mainly large-scale culling, let alone in the 17th century where technical equipment, vaccines, and medicines were scarce. Huang Dashan promised to develop a special vaccine, but there was still no result.

The only thing he could do was to strengthen institutional management and take strict disinfection measures to reduce the incidence rate to the lowest.

Yang Baogui had already arrived at the scene steps ahead of him. When Wu Nanhai went in, he was taking off his isolation gown. A naturalized trainee wearing a mask walked past holding a box of things. Wu Nanhai asked: "How is the situation?"

"Similar to your estimate, avian influenza can be preliminarily ruled out." Yang Baogui took off his gloves and put both gloves and the isolation gown into a special pocket. Through on-site facility inspection and examination of the dead chick corpses, Yang Baogui could roughly determine that the dead chicks were crushed to death—it should be the negligence of the breeding personnel. The temperature in the chick room had dropped in the latter half of the night, causing the chicks to gather in a pile to keep warm.

"However, for the sake of caution, I still extracted a second sample, all from chicks that died new this morning. You send them to the laboratory for culture inspection again."

Wu Nanhai opened the box and saw a sealed chick sample in a large glass jar inside, along with some unknown liquids in several small bottles. He shook his head and closed the box again.

"The density here is too high; sooner or later there will be chicken plague." Yang Baogui watched his students packing up the instrument case, "High mortality rate is too normal. I just tested the air humidity here, it's on the high side. You need to pay more attention."

Wu Nanhai nodded: "You are right. Besides diversion, management must be strengthened."

Coming out of the brooding house, Wu Nanhai rushed to the construction site of the farm's water conservancy project without stopping. He called the person in charge of the construction site to make arrangements for the 800 slave laborers arriving in a few days.

"Food supply should follow that of general migrant workers: rice until full, salted vegetables enough." Wu Nanhai arranged, "You just care about assigning tasks and urging the supervisors to complete them on time. Do not interfere with the management of guards and supervisors. Understand?"

These slaves were all brought by Quark. Although a large amount of labor force flowed in every day due to the launch of Operation Engine, with the rollout of construction across the whole island, Lingao's local labor force remained in a state of shortage. Especially for those extra-heavy physical labors with particularly high mortality rates, using immigrants who underwent long-distance transportation, purification, and recuperation was very uneconomical.

These slaves were originally purchased for the development of Sanya. Although high-intensity and high-risk operations were accompanied by a huge mortality rate, Quark Poor, driven by huge profits, continuously brought in slaves, causing the number of slaves to increase significantly instead. Now Sanya was basically saturated. After collective discussion at the last Senate plenary meeting, it was decided to open up the scope of application for slaves. It applied to all businesses requiring heavy physical labor throughout Hainan Island, Taiwan, etc.

However, this opening was limited to the scope of coolies for infrastructure projects and mining. The instruction issued by the Planning Commission explicitly prohibited the use of slaves in industrial and agricultural production. Except for temporary campsites, slaves were strictly forbidden from obtaining fixed residences near work locations or living mixed with indigenous people and naturalized citizens; slaves were not allowed to contact indigenous commoners and naturalized citizens unrelated to work. Any slave attempting to hide or escape during transport and labor would be executed on the spot without exception.

At the thought of this notice, Wu Nanhai felt a bit uneasy in his conscience, and a small ripple involuntarily rose in the bottom of his heart.

"Under every sleeper, there is a corpse of an Irishman." Wu Nanhai looked at the construction site in the deepening twilight and involuntarily crossed himself.

"Master, where to now?" Liu Ashui asked.

"To the Farm Teahouse."

The Farm Teahouse was the original Nanhai Farm Cafe. Since becoming an independent accounting unit under the Agricultural Committee, the official registered name became such a bland name as "Farm Teahouse". However, everyone still habitually called it Nanhai Cafe.

By the artificial lake at the end of Agricultural Second Road, a row of houses was brightly lit. The nightlife of the Farm Teahouse had just entered its climax.

This teahouse was a complex multi-story building. The main part had three floors. A protruding two-story podium building was built on the water-facing part. The water-facing side was a large glass wall for viewing the beautiful scenery on the water, and an open-air water-friendly platform was set up outside. When the weather was fine, tables, chairs, and parasols were set up on the platform for Senators' leisure.

On the other side of the building, there was a wooden single-story house—the site of the old teahouse, currently used as the General Office's special supply food store and teahouse auxiliary facility rooms.

Not far from the teahouse, separated by a nursery, was the "Agritainment" in the farm—the Lotus Pavilion. It was also currently under the management of the teahouse.

Lotus roots and other aquatic crops were planted in the artificial lake, which was also used to raise ducks. Because Senators reported smelling the stench of duck droppings with the wind from time to time when relaxing on the terrace, the duck shed originally located on the other side of the lake was moved away.

Outside the entire teahouse building, a small garden surrounded it, separated from the outside world by dense hedges and flowers and trees to ensure privacy.

Today, the Farm Teahouse was equally brightly lit. Faint music blew over in bursts with the evening breeze, accompanied by the fragrance of tuberoses by the roadside, giving it a somewhat decadent and luxurious mood.

Wu Nanhai's rickshaw had an access pass and passed through the gate post outside the garden smoothly, pulling directly to the bottom of the steps of the main building of the teahouse. A tall Spaniard wearing a European-style long coat walked down the steps slowly and bowed respectfully to Wu Nanhai. He said in not very fluent Chinese: "Welcome, Your Excellency."

"Hello, Sancho." Wu Nanhai got off the vehicle and said to Liu Ashui: "You go back first, no need to wait for me." Then he took out a cut "Li Quan Special Limited Edition" cigar. Sancho immediately took out a lighter and lit it for him. He took a deep drag, blew out a smoke ring, and took out a card from his pocket.

"My membership card."

This Spaniard was one of the several Spanish sailors captured in Bopu back then. After working in the labor reform team for more than a year, because he came from a grape farmer family in Galicia, Spain, he was asked for by Wu Nanhai. After attempting to grow grapes in vain—Hainan Island once again proved not suitable for grape cultivation—Sancho became a brewer in the fruit wine brewing workshop set up by Xue Ziliang, and concurrently served as a waiter in the teahouse bar at night.

Sancho was a poor wretch in Spain. His family had long since died or scattered, which was why he drifted to East Asia. Now having a stable life without living the hellish life at sea, he was naturally happy to spend his years here.

In addition to working as a bartender in the teahouse, he was also responsible for checking membership cards when welcoming guests. As a dedicated leisure and entertainment venue for the Senate, the Farm Teahouse adopted a membership system. Temporarily, only Senators were accepted as members, and every Senator, whether in Lingao or not, was given a card. Supplementary cards could be issued under the membership card, currently limited to naturalized citizens who were life secretaries, adopted children, and apprentices with formal master-apprentice relationships over the age of sixteen.

Members could consume on credit at the 'Tea House' and the affiliated special supply food store with the card. The bill was sent to the General Office every month to be deducted from the Senator's personal account. The Senator's main card could consume all items, while the supplementary card could only consume some services.

"Thank you." Sancho did not take the card, bowed again, and then turned sideways to lead the way in front.

Opening the tightly closed leather-clad door, a burst of soft music came out. The light in the hall was dim, only glass-covered candlesticks lit sporadically. The small dance floor in the middle had some electric lighting. The semi-bright and semi-dark atmosphere combined with soft music created a relaxed and gentle atmosphere.

The first floor of the main building was the leisure and entertainment area. All seats were high-backed booth seats. There was a bar selling various alcohols, tea, cocoa, and coffee. There was a dedicated smoking area, specially supplying hookahs, pipe tobacco, and cigars. There was also a small dance floor equipped with a small stage for performance and an orchestra pit. Currently, they were purely ornamental; they lacked instruments, and even more so, suitable musicians. Music still relied on audio equipment.

The second floor was in the form of teahouse private rooms, where members could have their own relatively private gatherings. The second floor provided various tabletop board games. Apart from traditional games like Ludo, Luzhanqi (Army Chess), playing cards, Chinese and International Chess, Go, Mahjong, Pai Gow, and dice, there were also various board games: Legends of the Three Kingdoms, Dungeons & Dragons, Warhammer, etc., in abundance. There was also a large recreation room equipped with locally made Snooker and Nine-ball billiard tables and pinball machines—these things were all made by skilled craftsmen in Guangzhou via Zicheng Firm according to the styles provided by Lingao, and could be called exquisite works of art.
