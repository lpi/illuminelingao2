# Chapter 335 - School System

"In my view, our goal is to revive technologies useful to us as much as possible within our lifetimes, and modify them to adapt to the environment, rather than blindly restoring technology." Ma Qianzhu said, "The difference in environment means our technology will inevitably walk a path completely different from the other timeline..."

"The Lord Superintendent's bad taste for Steampunk is coming out again." Someone whispered below.

Steam-powered gear computers, high-speed double-decker steam trains, and floating battleship airships. These were the three "future technology" plans that the Steampunk group headed by Ma Qianzhu was most enthusiastic about.

At this time, Hu Qingbai, the head of the Education Committee, stood up and said: "Based on everyone's proposals, my colleagues in the Ministry of Education and I discussed and believe that in education, we can uphold the principle of 'walking on two legs'."

The so-called "walking on two legs" meant conducting both rapid popular education and formal education. The former was to cope with immediate needs, while the latter was to reserve talents for future development.

This seemingly eclectic plan covered all aspects but was operable and consistent with current material capabilities. Finally, it was accepted and confirmed by everyone: the Transmigration Group would establish a mixed education system: National Education for children and Rapid Education for adults.

First was the National School, which was the foundation of National Education. It targeted collected orphans and children of indigenous people directly serving the Transmigration Group. It was compulsory; all children aged full eight years to under twelve years must enroll. Those over the age limit were relaxed to only participate in adult rapid literacy studies to get a most basic Type C Diploma.

The National School was a complete school, divided into two stages: Primary School and Secondary School. Completing the entire education would take nine years. But Hu Qingbai divided it into three stages: Lower Primary, Higher Primary, and Secondary School. In addition, a Nursery was set up specifically for preschool children.

The two-year Lower Primary curriculum focused on basic reading, writing, and arithmetic, and civic education—including simple general Chinese history, basic morality and social ethics, and simple natural science knowledge. Labor skills classes were set up to teach various useful work skills to improve hands-on ability and prepare for future work participation. Finally, a certain amount of physical education classes were set up to enhance physical fitness, changing the Chinese tradition of despising labor and neglecting practical practice starting from children.

After this stage of education was completed, a Type B Diploma would be issued. Graduates could enter the army for service, enter vocational schools or military-political schools, or directly join a department under the Transmigration Group to work. The plan of the education department for the next few years was to make popularizing the preliminary Type B Diploma the biggest task, covering the army, factories, farms, and all other aspects.

Children with the ability to continue learning could advance to Higher Primary, with a three-year schooling period, obtaining a Type A Diploma upon graduation.

Those holding a Type A Diploma could choose to continue advancing to Secondary School, Vocational Technical School, or Military-Political School. Secondary School lasted four years. According to the transmigrators' plan: those who could read up to Secondary School would be key objects of cultivation. The curriculum focused more on theory and basic science, enabling these children to ultimately master the advanced science, technology, concepts, and culture brought by the transmigrators. In other words, students who could complete nine years of National Education and obtain a Secondary School Diploma would become out-and-out social elites and one of the future successors of the Transmigration Group.

Adult Rapid Education was the focus of the current stage. Hu Qingbai came up with a plan based on requirements and opinions from various aspects: all indigenous soldiers and employees, once recruited, would undergo a one-month "purification" quarantine.

During the quarantine period, a method of half-day military training and labor, and half-day cultural study would be adopted. Military training was responsible by the Army, and cultural education was conducted by personnel sent by the Ministry of Education. The educational content was Mandarin, five hundred basic Chinese characters, and basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. A test would be conducted at the end. Those who passed the test would be issued a Type C Diploma.

Those who failed the test could undergo re-education in the department receiving them—army or factories—and participate in a cultural proficiency test every six months. Re-education would be arranged and organized by each department itself, with assistance provided by the education department.

The Type C Diploma was the most basic diploma under the Transmigration Regime; without it, one could hardly move a step. People without a Type C Diploma could not be promoted to regular workers or Private First Class, could not enter vocational technical schools, and certainly could not serve as grassroots cadres. In other words, without this diploma, one could only serve as the lowest level laborer within the Transmigration Group. No door for promotion would be open to them.

Originally, according to Hu Qingbai's intention, those who failed the test would be swept out the door, but given the current vigorous demand for labor and soldiers, doing so was too wasteful.

Those who obtained a Type C Diploma could continue to participate in further adult training as long as they had interest and time to improve their cultural level. But no mandatory requirement was made. However, when indigenous people were promoted to a certain level, the diploma would become an entry threshold—certain job types, positions, military ranks, or obtaining training for certain advanced vocational skills required holding a diploma of a certain level. This was to stimulate everyone's enthusiasm for learning through people's desire for advancement.

The education department would arrange a cultural proficiency test every six months, which anyone could come to take.

Another part of adult education was Vocational Skills Education. Current vocational education was quite organized. The Apprentice Corps was large in scale; orphans collected from the mainland who were judged unsuited for cultural studies were all assigned to the Apprentice Corps. Children of many indigenous employees within the group also entered this corps.

Hu Qingbai planned to establish a Vocational School based on this corps. This vocational school would follow the system and education model of the original Apprentice Corps. Recruitment targets included all indigenous people who had obtained diplomas: whether Type A, B, or C, or Secondary School diplomas. Of course, the job types that could be studied with different diplomas were also different. Polishers and nurses only required a Type C Diploma; teachers and medical officers must be Type B Diploma holders or above; doctors were for Secondary School Diploma holders.

The focus of the Vocational School was job types with higher technical content requiring longer training to be competent, including mechanics, teachers, medical personnel, etc., also for the future. Depending on the job type, training time ranged from three months to three years. During this period, there was both cultural study and internship labor in various departments.

Finally, the Military-Political School. Formed by merging the original Military-Political School and Rural Cadre Training Institute into the Lingao Military-Political Cadre School. Focus was on cultivating indigenous military and political cadres. The school was divided into three levels of classes: Class A, Class B, and Class C. Class A recruited those with Secondary School diplomas; Class B recruited those with Type A Diplomas. Class C recruited Type B Diploma holders—limited to in-service employees and soldiers, recommended for admission by the organization.

This education system, balancing short-term practical technology and long-term academic cultivation, satisfied all parties relatively well. Although some people had slight complaints that the Transmigration Group had returned to the "Diploma is All-Powerful" mode.

With the education system, educational infrastructure had to be built. The place Xiao Zishan was going to was exactly the site of the new school. Many long strip-shaped dormitories had already been built here. This place was far from the industrial area, with a relatively good environment and some miscellaneous woodlands. The terrain was high and dry, with much sand and stone, not very conducive to farming, but perfect for running a school. Now, the Lingao Construction General Company was engaging in large-scale construction on this piece of land, building a brand-new school.

Because manpower and material resources were limited and could not build three schools separately, this piece of land was named "Education Park" according to a fashionable term from the other timeline. Various teaching and living facilities inside could be shared. This education park was named "Fangcaodi (Fragrant Grass) Education Park."

When Xiao Zishan arrived here, the teaching area of Fangcaodi was already close to basic completion. Looking from the road in the distance: over a dozen two-story red brick-and-wood buildings had risen from the ground. Xiao Zishan felt these buildings were very familiar—the primary and middle schools he attended back then all had similar teaching buildings: long box shapes, a corridor on one side. A staircase was set up every two classrooms. A building could hold at least four to eight classrooms, or even twelve to sixteen classrooms.

Mei Wan, Education People's Commissar Hu Qingbai, and Clerk Bai Yu were waiting for him. logically, as the Director of the General Office, he was not responsible for education issues, and inspecting school construction was even less his duty. But as the Director of the General Office, Xiao Zishan was responsible for solving the education problem of the Transmigration Group's next generation, so inquiring about school construction was logical.

The appearance of the school was still very shabby. Due to lack of building materials, there was no perimeter wall, which fit the "Open Education" idea quite well, but having no walls in this timeline was quite dangerous. Mei Wan's alternative plan was dense bamboo fences—bamboo was plentiful here and easy to process.

"...Later we plant some climbing Rosaceae plants along the bamboo fence. In a few years, neither humans nor animals will be able to get close; it will become a true natural 'barbed wire'!" Mei Wan introduced.

The main gate was very majestic, using large stone blocks specially quarried from Bairen Quarry, in a three-arch European style—according to Mei Wan, it was copied from the main gate of Tsinghua University. only, somewhat nondescriptly, blockhouse-style structures were added on both sides of the gate. Four signs had already been hung at the gate: "Lingao National School," "Lingao Military-Political School," and "Nanhai Vocational Technical School."

The last sign was "Education People's Committee."

Xiao Zishan asked: "What's this about?"

"Oh, Wu Nanhai promised to allocate some extra food to students from the surplus agricultural products of the farm. So this counts as returning a favor." Hu Qingbai hurriedly said, "President Wen has already agreed."

Hearing that President Wen had already agreed, Xiao Zishan didn't say anything more. Seeing the sign of the Education Committee also hung here, he said: "The environment here is quite good; it's a good office location."
