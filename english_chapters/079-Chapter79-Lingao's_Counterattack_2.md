# Chapter 79 - Lingao's Counterattack (2)

The counterattack plan in the county seat basically came from Liu Dalin and Huang Shoutong, invisibly forming the situation of civil officials controlling military ones common in the Great Ming. Licentiate Liu was extremely learned, and influenced by the late Ming political situation, he had read quite a few military books and had some understanding of overall strategy and planning; Guard Commander Huang had been on the front line of hand-to-hand combat for many years, experienced countless small-scale slaughters, and was quite familiar with advancing and retreating in battle formation command. Seeing this situation, the officials and gentry felt very at ease.

From the spies, it was learned that the pirates were stationed separately in Bopu and Bairen Beach. The spy saw women at Bairen Beach, indicating that the pirates' old camp was there. Since the old camp was there, the central army should also be there.

Although there were many people gathered in the city now, those capable of going into battle to kill were limited. Huang Shoutong was a local native and had led braves in fighting for many years. He knew in his heart which family's braves could fight and which could only bully common people. The manpower truly usable was the one hundred Huang Family Stockade militia he brought himself, plus the militia and family servants of several local big households and wealthy gentry. Together, there were no more than two hundred people. He planned to use these people as combat soldiers to directly assault the pirates' center, preferably beheading a few leaders in one fell swoop.

This strategy was questioned by some gentry: Would the pirates retaliate madly if their leaders died?

"In matters of war, one must never hope for luck," Huang Shoutong stroked the beard under his chin, "Once weapons are moved, one must kill to the end. Don't think that showing mercy will leave a way out for the future. By then, others will see you as weak and easily bullied, and instead will intensify their actions." He swept a glance at everyone, majestic without anger, "Beat them until it hurts, beat them until they are afraid, and they will scram on their own."

Immediately, it was decided to split into two groups. The left route, with Huang Family Stockade militia as the main force, carrying two crouching tiger cannons removed from the city wall, and many rockets and gunpowder jars, totaling three hundred people, would be led by Huang Shoutong personally to attack Bairen Beach directly; the right route would be led by Fu BoWen, also with more than three hundred people, but most were temporarily conscripted common people acting as strong laborers, carrying many flags, horns, gongs, and drums, used to create momentum and feign an attack on Bopu camp as a diversion. To prevent pirates from having spies outside the city, the two groups of troops set off together, making a show of advancing towards Bopu, and halfway the left route army would turn back to raid Bairen Beach.

The two groups of troops agreed to use fire as a signal. The right route army would attack Bopu first, and then the main force would launch an attack. Regardless of which route had to withdraw from battle, wolf smoke would be used as a signal.

Besides the yamen runners, there were two hundred people left to guard the city. Because the county's archers and strong laborers had been owed grain and pay for too long, Wu Mingjin was afraid that if they were left to guard the city, once there was a failure, they would take the opportunity to riot and rob in the city and the four countrysides. He didn't dare to fully trust the militia coming from various villages either, so he used the method of mixing sand, organizing strong laborers, militia, archers, and guard station soldiers in mixed groups to guard the city. Those strong laborers who didn't want to fight could only bribe the jail warden; those who had no money and were driven to fight all harbored complaints.

On the sixteenth of the ninth lunar month, all preparations were complete. The county set up pots on the streets to cook. Many people ate dry rice for the first time this year, all squeezing in front of the pots, looking and smelling with mouths watering.

"Heavens, finally ate a full meal."

"Originally, to eat dry rice one had to wait for the busy farming season. These two years, even during busy farming seasons, we couldn't eat it."

"The sky is also strange; it actually frosts in this place of Lingao!"

"Just afraid this meal is the decapitation meal."

"Don't say depressing words, it's unlucky."

County Deputy Magistrate Wu Ya brought people to send a few hundred strings of cash, saying it was the departure reward money, and also took twenty sets of newly sewn cotton armor—although materials for this kind of armor were easy to obtain, it was inevitably too hot to wear in the South Sea land, so few people wore or used it. This was rushed out temporarily. Huang Shoutong knew that the magistrate relied on him as the Great Wall, was very moved, and thanked him repeatedly. He resolved to fight with all his might.

He called his second son over. Huang Shoutong's second son, Huang Bingkun, was studying in the county school and was a Licentiate. Seeing that his third brother had just died a few days ago, and his father was preparing soldiers and horses, looking like he was going to fight to the death, he felt very uneasy in his heart.

"Bingkun, father is going to suppress bandits today," he stroked his knees, "The pirates are formidable, there is no complete assurance for this trip..."

"Father—"

"Don't speak," Huang Shoutong said in a deep voice, "Father is already over fifty. Even if there is an accident, you and your eldest brother don't need to be too sad. Although your eldest brother is brave, he doesn't love studying and isn't as intelligent as you. Therefore, I only entrust you: In these ten years or so, signs of chaos in the world have gradually appeared. Fortunately, we are a remote small county here, but once the world is in great chaos, it is inevitable that petty people will take the opportunity to rebel. First, you must lead the children to hold weapons to defend the hometown; second is to conform to the Mandate of Heaven!" He stared into his son's eyes, "Do not just because you read a few more books, read yourself into foolish loyalty and foolish filial piety, do you understand?!"

"Yes! Son understands." Huang Bingkun was both clear and confused in his heart, but dared not ask more.

"Later you will go out of the city with me, and return to Huang Family Stockade on the way."

"Son wishes to go with father to kill!"

"Silly boy..." Huang Shoutong sighed long, "You are a Xiucai (Licentiate). Weapons are dangerous; the Huang family cannot be without you!"

"There is still Eldest Brother—"

"Your eldest brother is a commoner," Old Master Huang put on cotton armor with the help of family servants, "Grand Master Wu will always be transferred away. Will the new Grand Master in the future remember the blood and sweat credit of us father and sons? With a Xiucai, words spoken will be louder."

Hearing this, he deeply realized his father's painstaking efforts, only feeling faintly unwilling in his heart.

Huang Shoutong instructed his son, then led the large troop out of the city. On the way, he was moved by Magistrate Wu's trust this time on one hand, and on the other hand, he couldn't get rid of a bad premonition in his heart: This group of pirates riding huge iron ships and driving machinery that human power cannot resist are not the bandits and robbers he has been dealing with. Their arrival might mean that many things will change completely. He looked up at the sky; there were only faint floating clouds in the sky, but it made him feel the sun was dim and lightless. Is this world of Great Ming really going to have a great change?

Splitting troops on the road, he first led the team to a place two li away from Bairen Beach, waiting for the feigned attack on Bopu to start while listening to the spy's report back. He made up his mind that if Bairen Beach was unprepared at this moment, even if Fu BoWen hadn't started there, he would attack in advance.

Not long after, the spy reported back that the pirates at Bairen Beach had all shrunk back to various camps, and no one was walking outside anymore. Huang Shoutong nodded; this did not surprise him. The opponent's spies probably had already detected their movements.

Waiting for another moment, suddenly saw smoke and fire signals in the direction of Bopu, knowing that Fu BoWen had already started attacking. He spurred his horse up a mound.

"Fellow elders, we are about to attack the enemy formation. You and I are all local natives, living here for generations. Here are our fields and houses, ancestors' graves and ancestral halls..." Speaking of this, he felt his tears coming out, "Today is the day we protect our hometown and serve the imperial court. Everyone follow me!"

After finishing speaking, he knocked the stirrups of his horse, leading his mounted family servants as the vanguard, galloping towards the direction of Bairen Beach. The militia divided into two groups, rushing closely following these ten-plus riders. The gunners were in groups of ten or so, pulling in front and pushing behind, pushing the two crouching tiger cannons to the front with their lives.

He Ming had already seen their assembly with binoculars on the guard tower in the Administrative Zone. Seeing smoke and dust covering the sky and hearing the sound of drums coming in bursts at this moment, he knew the attack had begun and hurriedly picked up the walkie-talkie to warn. Almost simultaneously, sharp alarm sounds resounded through the sky on Bairen Beach. Everyone shivered—the attack began!

"Group Leader He... Group Leader..." The person coming was from the Communications Team, speaking unclearly at this moment, "Emergency at Bopu! The enemy is besieging Bopu!"

He Ming frowned. From the tracking reports of the observation post all the way, he knew the enemy split into two routes. Obviously, one route must be a feint. But the numbers of both routes were about the same, both carrying many handcarts, and now launched attacks almost simultaneously...

"Let Bopu hold on!" Bopu was much more perfect in defense than Bairen Beach. Now with more than one hundred people including ten Military Team members guarding, he felt holding it wouldn't be a big problem.

On the contrary, this central place, because construction was spread out, had many places to defend. The residential area needed defense, the place stacking equipment and vehicles needed defense, the hydropower station needed defense, and the newly built Administrative Zone also had to be defended. Most places only had two lines of barbed wire and an earthen rampart. How much combat power these urban otakus who hadn't fired a few bullets had was still an unknown.

Huang Shoutong's men rushed to the edge of the trench, threw the prepared earth bags and firewood bundles in, and instantly paved a road. At this time, gunshots rang out. Ten or so people around him fell immediately. The pirates' firearms were so sharp! He lowered his body, galloped fast. Gunshots were continuous, people around kept falling. He turned the horse head, deciding not to attack the bandits' old camp in depth, but to concentrate forces to attack the nearest camp. He pointed with the big saber in his hand:
"Brothers, charge and kill over there!"

The camp he selected happened to be the Administrative Zone. Because it was recently completed not long ago, even the barbed wire was just set up yesterday. It was guarded by fifty people, ten of whom were members of the Military Team.

"Meng Xian! You are responsible for suppressing the top!" He Ming roared in the walkie-talkie, "Hit those riding horses."

Before the voice fell, a militia waving a saber and leaping on a horse fell to the ground with a gunshot.

"Damn, good shot!" He couldn't help but praise aloud. This finance and accounting major student who had practiced moving targets in sports school for a few years really had good marksmanship.

At this time, the militia had surged over like a tide. Gunshots became a mess. Seeing these people screaming with bared teeth and waving all kinds of weapons charging over, the people behind the barbed wire, most of whom were good citizens in the past, let alone shooting to kill, hadn't even seen gang fights a few times. Where had they seen such a scene? Each was flustered and dumbfounded. After firing a shot, they were all dumbfounded, only a few messy shots rang out.

"Shoot! You bunch of idiots!" He Ming suddenly snatched up an SKS rifle, flicked the bayonet out with force, quickly rushed to the front, kicking and beating them.

Finally, volley fire rang out. The charging gray tide stagnated for a moment, then surged over again. At this time, messy gunshots also rang out from other camps to support them. Most transmigrators were unfamiliar with shooting. Many forgot to adjust the sight and fired. Some people pulled the trigger and fired randomly continuously. Soon the bullets were finished.
