# Chapter 871 - Three Mountains Street

The grandeur of Nanjing in this time-space also left a deep impression on Zhou Dongtian. Lingao, a small county town, went without saying, but even Guangzhou, where he had once gone for an "internship," and Hangzhou, which he had visited—two first-class great cities of the time—could not compare in terms of city walls.

In the old time-space, Zhou Dongtian had visited many cities, and Nanjing was among them. Even then, though the Nanjing city walls were already ruined and crumbling, they left him marveling at the Ming Taizu's determination to defend his capital and his willingness to spare no expense.

Nanjing's city walls were built entirely according to the local terrain. Not only did they incorporate Yuan Dynasty walls of the Yingtian Prefecture, but they also extensively utilized the various hills around Nanjing as part of the defensive system. In some sections, the mountain itself was directly used as the wall's foundation. Consequently, the walls were irregular in shape. Connected to Zhong Mountain on the east, anchored on Stone Mountain to the west, backed by Xuanwu Lake to the north, and threaded by the Qinhuai River to the south—following mountains and embracing water, the presence was extraordinary. The wall foundations extravagantly used granite or limestone blocks, with the outer faces laid in large bricks. The mortar between bricks was mixed with lime, glutinous rice paste, or sorghum paste blended with tung oil, making them exceptionally solid.

At this moment, although many years had passed without war, Nanjing's city walls and defensive facilities inevitably showed signs of deterioration. But the walls remained in good condition. Zhou Dongtian, though not a soldier, knew that the Army's current artillery absolutely could not destroy Nanjing's city walls—Japanese artillery in the 1930s hadn't been able to destroy them either, let alone the Fubo Army's smoothbore cannons, which were far more primitive than Japanese artillery.

"If only the Southern Ming court had resisted resolutely, the Qing army could never have taken this city," Zhou Dongtian sighed. When the Xiang Army besieged Tianjing, the twenty thousand exhausted Taiping soldiers inside could rely on the walls to resist for a long time. The Southern Ming's conditions were surely better than the Taiping's. What a pity that the imperial court, exhausted by factional struggle, lost trust within and without, and ultimately surrendered without a fight.

Mei Lin, however, was thinking about the Qinhuai River. His idea of meeting the Eight Beauties of Qinhuai had been temporarily dismissed. Before departure, Zhao Yingong had given him a historical primer: one of the Eight Beauties had already passed away, and of the remaining seven, except for Liu Rushi, born in 1618 and having just turned 14, the others were genuine little girls.

"Could you bring yourself to do it?" Zhao Yingong had asked. "Even Liu Rushi is too young."

Mei Lin was a modern person after all, and there were some limits. But since the Eight Beauties couldn't be enjoyed for now, he still wanted to visit the Qinhuai River—this famous Ming Dynasty pleasure quarter, said to be a gathering place of beauties. What was it really like? Mei Lin wanted to experience it. He also wanted to verify whether the ancients' aesthetic tastes were really as peculiar as rumored.

The prosperity of the streets made it hard to believe this was the last days of the Great Ming, on the verge of collapse. Although the activities of the "Jianlu" [Later Jin] and "roving bandits" were appearing more and more frequently in people's conversations, and disasters struck various regions year after year—news of "lamenting geese everywhere" and "starving corpses lining the roads" constantly circulated. Even the terrifying reports of people "exchanging children to eat," previously rarely heard, were now common... Everywhere was news of famine, military defeats, additional levies, and popular uprisings. The country's situation grew more chaotic by the day. Even in Jiangnan, which had always been quite affluent, rice prices had risen to three taels of silver per *shi*—never in the history of the Great Ming since its founding had Jiangnan rice prices been so high. Yet none of this seemed to cast even the slightest shadow over this Jiangnan metropolis.

However, many unsettling shadows could also be found here. Those speaking in accents from north and south included not only officials, gentry, and great households, but also many refugees and beggars—their numbers on the streets had clearly increased and continued to grow. In winter, the *zipù* [ward patrols] inside the city collected far more "road death" corpses than in previous years. Refugees fleeing famine from various regions, especially from Jiangbei and Anhui, were so numerous that the human markets outside the city were packed with people selling themselves into slavery. As a result, the price of human beings had plummeted.

The senior clerk from Qiwei's Nanjing branch, Cai Yibang, who had been accompanying the sedan the whole way, now called a halt. Slightly lifting the sedan curtain, he said to Zhou Dongtian: "Master! Up ahead is Three Mountains Street. Please instruct which bookshop you wish to visit?"

Zhou Dongtian didn't know how to answer for a moment. His purpose was to survey the local book-carving industry. He had long heard that Three Mountains Street in the Ming Dynasty was the publishing center of Jiangnan, which was why he had come. But specifically which establishment to visit, he didn't know.

After pondering briefly, he said: "Let's get out here and walk around the street to have a look. Tell the sedan bearers to wait here."

"Yes." Cai Yibang replied. Under his commands in Nanjing Mandarin, the sedan turned sideways. Zhou Dongtian emerged from the sedan and stretched his body—sedan bearers certainly had it hard, but sitting in a sedan for long periods wasn't pleasant either. The interior wasn't a sofa chair; it wasn't even a rattan chair. It was a standard hardwood straight-backed chair. The sedan rider could only sit upright, body unable to move freely. To outsiders it looked both dignified and comfortable; in reality, sitting for long periods left legs and back equally numb.

Getting out of the sedan, Zhou Dongtian surveyed the street. Three Mountains Street was much quieter than the busy market they had just passed through. The narrow flagstone road had few pedestrians, and most were clearly "people of rank," mostly wearing long robes. The few in short working clothes were servants sent by their masters to buy books.

As soon as the two men alighted, they attracted the attention of passersby. Compared to those around them, they were indeed quite distinctive: robust build, dark complexion, and taller than average.

Mei Lin felt somewhat uncomfortable—he hadn't received specialized training from the Intelligence Bureau, having only spent a week in a crash course before departure. The long robe always felt ill-fitting, and the hair knot and headcloth constantly felt like they would fall off. His hands and feet seemed to have nowhere to go.

Zhou Dongtian was comparatively better off. After all, he served in the intelligence community. According to Joint Security Council decisions, intelligence personnel were required to undergo a certain amount of cross-training, so he had studied in the "Farm" system.

"Let's go," Zhou Dongtian said to Cai Yibang. "Lead the way. We'll just browse around here."

"Yes, Master."

The air was suffused with a faint fragrance of ink—the genuine fragrance of ink, carrying the scent of pine soot. Zhou Dongtian had once caught this same fragrance in the rare book vault of a library—the scent of fine Song Dynasty block-printed books. Even more intense than here.

On both sides of Three Mountains Street were almost entirely bookshops, large and small. The largest had five *jian* [bays] of storefront; the smallest had only one. But regardless of size, the eaves of the shops were all very high. Looking in from the street, one could see row upon row of tall bookshelves against the walls, filled with various books.

Each bookshop had its own shop name and signboard. Most of the bookshops here were "comprehensive bookstores," selling all types of books. Some specialized in certain categories—Buddhist sutras, Daoist texts, and other religious books. Others specialized in *weimo*—the eight-legged essays, examination poems, and policy essays from successful candidates at the imperial examinations. In old time-space terms, they specialized in "supplementary examination materials." Although people of the time looked down on *weimo*, the demand created by the imperial examination system was substantial. In both Ming and Qing dynasties, book publishing was very slow—from manuscript completion to carving and printing, at least three or four years. Only the imperial examination essays were selected, compiled, and carved immediately after the exams ended. This showed how strong the demand was.

Zhou Dongtian knew from Grand Library lectures that these specialized *weimo* bookshops were basically all run by Jiangxi natives. Besides selecting, compiling, and carving *weimo*, their other main business was facilitating examination fraud—acting as go-betweens for chief examiners and examinees. Except for less important routine examinations and children's tests, they could arrange connections at practically every level of the imperial examination system. By the Qing Dynasty, this became their main business.

Apart from some bookshops that only sold books, almost every larger bookshop had its own carving and printing workshop, storing large quantities of printing blocks. Such bookshops almost invariably followed a "shop in front, workshop in back" model. Standing outside the shop, one could hear the sounds of printing workers in the back courtyard—rubbing, inking, brushing. Sometimes, when the doors between front and back were open, one could even directly see the carving and printing workers busily at work.

Zhou Dongtian strolled along with interest, observing the various bookshops. This place somewhat resembled the book markets in old time-space cultural markets, but without that clamorous energy. The quiet atmosphere mingled with the faint fragrance of ink and paper, giving him a sense of pleasure.

But this pleasant mood would not shake his determination to personally destroy Three Mountains Street's printing industry. As long as books were published and printed by traditional methods, they would forever remain cultural luxuries accessible only to a tiny minority. The Elder Council had to completely smash this system. Making knowledge cheap and universal was a necessary condition.

With such thoughts, he strolled into a bookshop. Mei Lin and Cai Yibang followed him in.

This bookshop wasn't the largest business on Three Mountains Street, but its storefront was spacious—three *jian* wide, tall and bright. Inside, the book collection was abundant. On the tall bookshelves covering three walls were books of every kind: classics, histories, philosophers, collected works, examination essays, model essays, plays, novels, medical texts, painting albums, wine records, tea classics—truly comprehensive.

The bearing and attire of Zhou Dongtian and Mei Lin were unlike ordinary people. The shopkeeper was very attentive, immediately approaching to invite them to sit. He instructed the clerk to brew tea and set out a fruit plate, then asked their names and native places.

"My surname is Zhou, from Guangdong," said Zhou Dongtian. "Traveling here for study."

"By the look of you, Master Zhou must surely have examination credentials?" The shopkeeper's deferential face revealed a hint of pride. "My humble shop doesn't dare claim to have every book, but on this street, our selection is considered quite complete."

*"Zìpù" [字铺]: At the time, residents in the five districts of Nanjing were organized into groups of 100 households under the baojia system, numbered using the Thousand Character Classic. The Military-Civil Mounted Patrol selected chief constables and fire wardens for each ward patrol, responsible for local fire prevention and public order.*
