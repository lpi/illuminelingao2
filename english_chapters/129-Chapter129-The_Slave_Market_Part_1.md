# Chapter 129: The Slave Market (Part 1)

Among them, besides Xiao Zishan, none had engaged in time-travel commerce. Seeing this so-called "Crystal Dawn Jade mirror"—obviously just a plastic-framed Wenzhou egg mirror sold in heaps in wholesale markets, with the best quality perhaps costing ten yuan apiece—selling for 150 *liang* here was shocking!

Guo Yi and the others, seeing so much silver spent on a glass mirror for the first time, were shocked speechless, shaking their heads and momentarily unable to process it. Xiao Zishan said quietly, "How about it? More confident now? Guangzhou isn't like other regions—it's this timeline's wealthiest city in all of East Asia."

Yan Maoda nodded, sighing endlessly. "I never imagined Guangzhou would be so prosperous in this era. I'm confident about opening a jewelry company here now."

A clerk came over to solicit business. Yan Maoda, wanting to gauge the market, asked to see pearls—the transmigrators had brought large quantities of freshwater cultured pearls from the other timeline. The clerk retrieved several trays from the cabinet. The largest were nearly an inch in diameter, while the smallest were the size of pomegranate seeds. Most were quite round, and some were elongated ovals. Even in the limited indoor light, the pearl luster was impressive.

The small ones were 10–20 *liang* each. The largest had an asking price of 4,000 *liang*. Yan Maoda, having studied pearl history in the jewelry trade, knew historical dynasties highly valued pearls. These were natural pearls and very precious. But one large pearl selling for 4,000 *liang*—he was still astonished.

Most remarkable was a tray of slightly elongated purple pearls. Yan Maoda examined them closely. The clerk said these were of Western origin and a rare color, and that this size cost 200 *liang* each.

Exiting, they walked into a nearby alley where there were fewer people. Yan Maoda said, "Just selling our 100 kg of freshwater pearls would yield enormous profits."

"But they don't look as nice," Lu Rong said.

Yan Maoda said, "Pearl color indeed isn't as good. But that's not a big deal. The problem is that tray of purple pearls. These are Australian seawater pearls. I never expected Guangzhou would have them."

"They were probably harvested from there? Sailing from Southeast Asia to Australia isn't too difficult."

"Probably. This means someone has been to Australia—at least its offshore islands."

"Developing Australia might actually be nice..."

Chatting and laughing, they sightseen along the way. Lu Rong was interested in street food but feared getting sick, so he resisted, his mouth watering. Ahead, the street scenes grew desolate—there was occasional wasteland, yet still voices. Liu Gang halted. "Ahead is a slave market. There is nothing worth seeing—just scenes of families being torn apart. Very tragic. Gentlemen, let's walk elsewhere."

Xiao Zishan hesitated. Before leaving for Guangzhou, the Committee had privately discussed purchasing people. Lingao's local labor was limited, and they needed some external migration. But the current issue wasn't labor—rather, it was many transmigrators' gradually emerging "physiological needs."

These physiological needs—food and sex—were human nature. For a long time after D-Day, everyone worked exhausting hours, nervously guarding against possible attacks, leaving them physically and mentally drained. Naturally, no one raised this issue. Recently, situations had stabilized. Leisure time increased, but entertainment was lacking. Five hundred-plus people—mostly young men in their prime—inevitably had sexual thoughts. The problem was that only a dozen had wives or girlfriends. Most relied on watching adult videos for relief—which added fuel to the fire rather than providing relief. So, despite overall positive developments, some disharmonious incidents occurred: voyeurism during women's bathing, secret upskirt photos—repeatedly. Most seriously, someone attempted the nighttime rape of Salina—though they'd badly underestimated this big ATF agent's capabilities. Salina was only slightly shaken and unharmed, but of the three would-be attackers, she sent one to the hospital.

Ran Yao quickly identified the perpetrators. For stability's sake, the matter was suppressed. The three offenders were dispatched far away to the Bopu Camp to avoid Salina encounters causing conflicts.

The incident was resolved, but the Committee saw dangerous signs. The camp had multiple women, but very few were single. In other words, the transmigrator group couldn't internally solve its needs for male-female interaction. If future rape incidents occurred, or adultery problems arose, the Committee would face not just a crying woman but also a raging cuckolded husband. How would they handle it? What would be the consequences? It was unimaginable.

If the perpetrators had slightly more awareness—like those three at least knowing their comrades' wives were off-limits—and shifted to raping village women instead, what would happen? Rape was what commoners hated most. From the Red Army through the PLA eras, rapists were executed. Would they also execute rapists? That seemed to violate the Committee's principle that "all people are equal, but some are more equal than others."

Even without rape—what about visiting prostitutes? Never mind whether Lingao had brothels; contracting STDs would be troublesome. The 17th and 18th centuries were exactly when syphilis massively entered coastal China. If unlucky enough to be "hit," the Medical Group would waste precious penicillin on treatment.

In short, not solving physiological problems meant major hidden dangers!

Some had proposed solutions. Xiao Zishan suggested prioritizing recreational facilities—nightly movies, sports competitions, etc. But this was palliative and had limited effect. Then someone proposed bolder ideas: establish a brothel with strict hygiene measures preventing STD transmission. The Committee would issue monthly "pleasure vouchers," and beyond that, it would be self-funded.

This proposal was the most efficient, but most Committee members couldn't accept it, as brothels were backward, cruel institutions. How could 21st-century civilized people establish one! As for distributing prostitution vouchers, it was unthinkable. *(Note: Apparently several German cities have issued free prostitution vouchers recently. Very awkward. German citizens are quite fortunate.)*

After secret deliberations and consultations, the Committee decided: act quickly and purchase women from the mainland. Under the "female servant" designation, assign them to single men. Nominally, they were for housework; practically, they could do whatever they wanted.

But this proposal also faced opposition. Xiao Zishan opposed it too, based on simple logic: he managed internal affairs. If pseudo-wife distribution was adopted, the current collective dormitory system would collapse—men with "servants" definitely wouldn't share rooms anymore. This meant expanding housing construction.

After multiple nights of discussion, debate, and hearings, the "female servant" plan was finally approved. Thus, Xiao Zishan's Guangzhou trip gained another task: buying women.

It sounded titillating—but it wasn't easy. Human trafficking required professional slave dealers. But their merchandise was expensive. He'd asked Gao Ju, and learned that an ordinary-looking twelve or thirteen-year-old girl cost seven to eight *liang* minimum. Pretty and clever ones cost at least twenty *liang*. Higher quality ones—like Yangzhou's "thin horses"—had no limit; 70–80 *liang* was the minimum, and sometimes they cost hundreds.

Moreover, slave dealers controlled the "supply." Famine refugees or destitute girls selling themselves—nine out of ten fell into their hands. Outsiders couldn't easily intervene—unless massive famine drove refugee floods.

Now, hearing Liu Gang mention a slave market ahead, he thought it was worth checking. Even if there were no suitable women, buying children would help. Wu Nanhai had specifically mentioned that cultivating the transmigrators' own talent must start with children. Only thorough worldview reformation—instilling entirely new knowledge and concepts—would work.

"Let's look. I want to buy some household servants," Xiao Zishan said, walking forward.

Of course, this wasn't a professional market—just a wasteland cluttered with refugees from various places. There was a ruined temple and even some overgrown graves. Makeshift shelters were scattered everywhere. Refugees from Guangdong, Guangxi, Jiangxi, and Fujian sat or lay about, looking ghostly and blank-faced. Some could still shuffle with begging sticks. Some cooked salvaged food scraps, emitting the stench of rotten soup. The air was smoky and fetid—strange odors neither moldy nor burnt. Against the collapsed temple wall lay a row of rigid corpses covered with tattered mats—only pairs of cracked dry feet protruded. The ashes of paper money remained... Three to four months ago, this scene would have shocked them. Now they'd grown accustomed to this timeline's everyday death.

The grounds had local militia maintaining order, as well as a gruel-dispensing shelter—some evidence of local government relief. However, well-dressed figures came and went—all here to buy people.
