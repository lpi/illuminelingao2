# Chapter 1387 - Zhongyuan Festival Plan

As the laughter subsided, Gou Chengxuan said: "Mr. Hao lives too bitterly here; it's dirty and smelly. It's not easy for us to come here to discuss matters. How about I speak to Master and settle a house outside to invite you to live in..."

Hao Yuan shook his head: "Don't despise the dirt and smell here; human hearts are much cleaner than elsewhere. Here I am like a fish in water, stable as Mount Tai."

"Mr. Hao lives here, don't the pa-cchia and yamen runners come to make noise?"

"Hehe, no hindrance. No one is so blind. The mother of the Baozheng here was sick and dying; it was I who helped invite a doctor and grab medicine to keep her life. He wanted to kowtow and become sworn brothers with me. As for pa-cchia, they're too lazy to come to this stinking mud pond to find trouble. Those 'doing official business' in the yamen dare not come here even more—the dead body pit in the chaotic graveyard behind, the Qiantang River in front; knock someone down and throw them in, even Bao Qinglian reborn couldn't find them. Besides, what oil can be squeezed out by coming here?"

"Mr. Hao is indeed a great hermit hiding in the city." Gou Chengxuan flattered him somewhat inappropriately.

"What hermit am I? Just an ordinary weaver. Happened to know a few characters, not biologically blind, read a few books, can understand reasoning." Hao Yuan smiled faintly, "I just can't stand this Master Zhao treating poor people like dirt, manipulating people with a flip of his hand. Must teach them a lesson."

Gou Chengxuan and Cao Guangjiu laughed dryly, not daring to continue the topic. This Hao Yuan seemed to naturally have a demeanor of a strong person, making these two "scoundrels" feel awe.

"The Master wants to know: When does Mr. Hao plan to give Master Zhao a hard time?" Gou Chengxuan asked.

"Now let's smudge Master Zhao's reputation first." Hao Yuan's smile vanished in an instant, tapping his finger on the table sayings, "In less than half a month it will be the Zhongyuan Festival on the 15th of the 7th month. The 15th of the 7th month is the Ghost Festival, for worshipping ancestors and also offering sacrifices to wandering souls and wild ghosts—there have been disasters these years, and there are too many wandering souls and wild ghosts in hell. Just right to let Master Zhao bleed a little to appease the anger of those resentful souls."

Hao Yuan continued: "The 15th of the 7th month is an interesting day. Zhongyuan Ghost Festival. Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva manifests spirits, the gates of hell open, wandering souls and wild ghosts are all released. Releasing river lanterns, performing Yankou. Let's also seek justice for the wandering souls and wild ghosts! Since we are releasing river lanterns, let's release a big one, make a hundred thousand river lanterns, float them directly to the pier of Phoenix Mountain Villa. Then set up a rite at the Villa gate, perform a huge Yankou. Living people and dead people, those with grievances report grievances, those with hatred report hatred."

"A rite? Who is willing to perform this rite—this is the main gate of Phoenix Mountain Villa. He is now a remarkably famous gentry in the provincial capital; ordinary monks probably wouldn't dare."

"As long as money is spent, still fear not finding monks willing to do it? At worst find a wild monk to do it!" Gou Chengxuan slapped his thigh.

"Hehe, ordinary monks dare not, naturally there are extraordinary monks." Hao Yuan was confident, "Why need to find wild monks? If we find one, we must find a famous high monk of great virtue, to show Master Zhao's incurrence of divine and human wrath—Is Master Zhao not very happy licking the Cross Religion's groove? Still remember last year's religious case?"

Gou Chengxuan and Cao Guangjiu nodded simultaneously. This Hao Yuan thought really deep! Although that religious case had calmed down, the parties involved's hatred of the Cross Religion hadn't dissolved. And although Zhao Yingong didn't publicly follow the religion, his frequent visits to churches and close association with gentry holding the Cross Religion were seen by everyone. With proper guidance, monks' hatred of the Cross Religion could easily be transferred to Zhao Yingong's head.

"Mr. Hao, your calculations really miss nothing..." Cao Guangjiu complimented from the heart.

"The enemy of an enemy is a friend." Hao Yuan said, "If they are willing to take the lead, wouldn't it be the best of both worlds? Zhang Guangtian might even be grateful to us."

He added that in the placards, special mention should be made of Zhao Yingong's collusion with Cross Religion foreign monks, hinting that someone in Phoenix Mountain Villa practiced "Western evil arts."

"Must specifically mention his collusion with foreign monks, playing with Western evil magic—that's why there are so many fresh gadgets. Don't forget many things he sells are Australian goods! Who can explain clearly the origin of Australian goods? Give the scholars and people of this whole city a reminder too."

"High, really high!" Gou Chengxuan originally harbored hatred towards bandits; hearing him mention this fit his intention exactly, "Not that brother is blabbing, I see this Master Zhao is a genuine bandit replacement!"

"Hehe, whether he is a bandit or not is irrelevant." Hao Yuan smiled faintly, "Just smear the reputation of the so-called Australians. In the future, it won't be so easy for them to deceive the common people using tricks of playing ghost and doctor simultaneously. Must let the common people see clearly their true face! Otherwise, driving away one Zhao Yingong, there will be Liu Yingong, Wang Yingong."

Gou Chengxuan and Cao Guangjiu understood but not fully, but they didn't ask much. One was originally full of hatred for bandits, the other took money to do things and was uninterested in other matters.

Hao Yuan added: "However, don't drag gentry following the religion into the placards. We are dealing with Zhao Yingong; don't increase enemies casually."

"Good, let's do it this way!" Gou Chengxuan slapped the table shouting brave, "After I go back and report to Master, I'll send people to handle it!"

Cao Guangjiu also expressed he would prepare enough manpower, ready to distribute placards, spread rumors, and then incite common people to cause trouble.

"What about Wanbi Bookshop?" Gou Chengxuan suddenly remembered.

"Wanbi Bookshop is in the city. Let alone gathering a few thousand people, even two or three hundred people walking in a group on the street, the yamen will be nervous, and immediately someone will come out to suppress the scene," Cao Guangjiu was experienced in doing such things, knowing deeply the difference between inside and outside the city. Outside the city, thousands or hundred of people fighting with weapons, local officials would wait until fighting finished to come out and handle.

Hao Yuan said: "Old Cao is right. In doing this, we can't make the government lose face too much. Making too big a commotion in the city won't do. outside the city gate it's nothing. Besides, of Zhao Yingong's two major strongholds in Hangzhou, Phoenix Mountain Villa is the most core. disabling this place, he won't be able to recover breath for at least half a year or a year. With this gap period, we can then slowly deal with him."

They discussed some specific arrangement details. Since it was now only the sixth month of the lunar calendar, there was still a month...

Cao Guangjiu and Gou Chengxuan quietly left under escort only when night reached the third watch—there was no place to stay here, even if there were they wouldn't stay.

Seeing off these two, Hao Yuan stretched his waist and sat on the bed. He didn't want to sleep at all, eyes bright and piercing, seeming to be thinking about something.

Just then, the door curtain woven of rice straw was carefully lifted at a corner, revealing a child with a clean-shaven head, about eleven or twelve years old, holding a big chipped bowl with a few pieces of steaming coarse grain cake inside.

"Uncle Hao, you're busy until midnight again. Mother steamed this, said to bring it to you for a late-night snack."

"Your family isn't well-off either. This cake is dry food for when your father goes out to do business tomorrow, right? If I eat it, what will your father eat tomorrow? Take it back—I'm not hungry."

"There's still cake, it's not some rare thing—there isn't much stuff intended for humans inside." The child laughed, having a bit of bright eyes and graceful glances, plus a slender face and pointed chin—turned out to be a girl. She was quite good-looking, just face color green-grey, cheeks sunken.

"Not stuff intended for humans, yet can't even eat full on it." Hao Yuan smiled faintly, "Uncle Hao can eat full himself, and doesn't need to work tomorrow. You'd better take it back. Grain is so expensive now, your parents' health isn't good, eating one more mouthful is good."

"Father's life and mine were saved by you—if not for you, I would have been sold to someone as a slave girl. You refusing even one piece of coarse grain cake is forcing us to feel uneasy for a lifetime." The girl said.

"I didn't save people expecting return." Hao Yuan smiled.

"I know, you are accumulating virtue by doing good deeds." The girl said, "If you expected return, would you come to our place?" As she spoke she stuffed the coarse grain cake into Hao Yuan's hand, "Eat, eat. Eating it down, our hearts will also be at peace. Our family only has this bit of heart—wanting to cook a bowl of lotus root starch dumplings for you is impossible." saying so she sighed.

Hao Yuan had no choice but to take a bite. The coarse grain cake was black and distinct; called mixed grain, it was mainly rice bran mixed with some bean dregs and miscellaneous grains. In the mouth, not only was it coarse and hard to chew and swallow, but there was also an indescribable musty and sour taste.

But even this thing, not every household in Nanxiawa could use to fill their stomachs. The little girl's father did small business, specializing in selling snacks like lotus root starch dumplings and red bean paste, considered barely able to scrape a living.

The little girl clapped hands laughing: "Uncle Hao, sure enough you are not from a poor family. If we ate this stuff, it would go down the stomach in two or three bites."

Hao Yuan patted her bald head: "If I were a rich man would I live here?"

"maybe your family was rich before."

Hao Yuan laughed: "Before ah..." His smile became profound and bewildered.

"I guessed right." The girl clapped hands. Actually that "Mr. Hao" might be a child of a rich family who fell and drifted here was the "consensus" of Nanxiawa residents, but no one ever said so to his face—everyone felt this was "Mr. Hao's" sad matter.

"Before I wasn't from a rich family either." Hao Yuan came back to his senses with a concealing smile, "You, a girl, staying at my place late at night for too long isn't good. Hurry back."

"What kind of person am I ranked as?" The little girl laughed, "Anyone here cares about this? Maybe which day I'll be taken out and sold. Last time if not for Uncle Hao's help, don't know in which house I'd be suffering now! Maybe already beaten to death alive."

Hao Yuan took another bite of coarse grain cake, saying: "Nothing to say about that. Happened to have a few coins. Without those few coins, what use is my good heart?"

"So it's my luck that's good—Uncle Hao is my lucky star, no, you are Nanxiawa's lucky star..."
