# Chapter 1295 Catching Them All in One Net

On January 11, 1633 AD, the 2nd day of the 12th lunar month in the Gui-Si year, the day after the "population for grain" transaction between the rebels in Dengzhou and Qimu Island ended, the Second Fleet and the Northbound Detachment suddenly launched an amphibious attack on the Miaodao Archipelago, capturing the Greater and Lesser Changshan Islands in one fell swoop, killing and capturing more than 500 rebels including the Changdao defender Wang Bingzhong, controlling the maritime gateway of Dengzhou. The Second Fleet immediately patrolled the Dengzhou waters, completely cutting off contact between Dengzhou and the various islands in Bohai Bay.

Li Jiucheng and Kong Youde, who were holding fast in the city, were greatly shocked after hearing the news. Kong Youde came to negotiate in person. Lu Wenyuan immediately proposed conditions: They must give up Dengzhou immediately and hand it over to the Qimu Island side. In exchange, the Qimu Island side allowed them to take all soldiers, weapons and baggage to board ships and leave.

On the beacon tower on Dazhushan Island, the cold wind was piercing. Lu Wenyuan wore a thick cotton robe and a cotton hat, looking just like an old country bumpkin, but compared to Kong Youde beside him who was fully armored and wearing a large cloak, he appeared much more leisurely and at ease.

Kong Youde roughly agreed to the request to abandon the city, but repeatedly proposed that since it was winter and navigation was difficult, they should at least be allowed to stay in Dengzhou until spring. But Manor Lord Lu just refused to relent, and stated that if they refused this suggestion, he would cooperate with the government army to besiege Dengzhou.

"...General naturally understands that the government troops are currently staying in Laizhou because of lack of grain, not lack of soldiers. Even if the General can cut the grain route again... Since I can supply General Kong with hundreds of thousands of catties of foreign potatoes, can't I provide them to the government troops?" Lu Wenyuan said slowly, "Zhu Dadian and Sun Yuanhua are both anxious for the General's head to explain to the Emperor."

"Doesn't the Manor Lord want the heads of Commander Li and myself to curry favor with Lords Zhu and Sun?" Kong Youde stared with bloodshot eyes and said in a deep voice.

"If I wanted the General's head, why wait until today?" Lu Wenyuan smiled slightly, pulled out a handkerchief from his sleeve, and waved it in the air.

The 130mm main guns on the four 901 gunboats of the Second Fleet anchored on the sea roared simultaneously. Shells flew over the vast sea surface and shot into Dengzhou City. Four huge explosions immediately sounded in the city, with black smoke rolling, and rumbling sounds coming from afar.

Kong Youde turned pale—this was the first time he had seen the true power of the 901 with his own eyes.

"General doesn't think my words are false now, right?" Lu Wenyuan was all smiles.

Kong Youde was silent for a long time, and finally asked the question he had always wanted to ask: "Who are you?! What exactly do you want to do?!"

Li Jiucheng and others finally succumbed and agreed to surrender the city that very day. Since the ships controlled by the rebels were limited, less than 20,000 people could board. However, Manor Lord Lu showed great mercy and expressed willingness to lend them several ships to carry the rest of the people. As for the destination of the sea transport, it was set as Guanglu Island.

Guanglu Island was Chen Youshi's station. After Chen Youshi led his army to join the Dengzhou rebels, this island remained under the control of his subordinates. Borrowing this place temporarily, they could barely pass the winter—thanks to the population for grain exchange, they had enough potatoes for the winter. Guanglu Island was close to Lushun. Li Jiucheng and Kong Youde discussed that taking advantage of having grain in winter, they would attack Lushun from Guanglu, drive away or kill Dongjiang Commander-in-Chief Huang Long, reoccupy the old Dongjiang territory, and integrate the various Dongjiang units. In this way, whether dealing with the Imperial Court or the Eastern Barbarians (Manchus), they could advance or retreat with a base.

On the 10th day of the 12th lunar month in the Gui-Si year, the rebel fleet sailed out of Dengzhou Water City. The Northbound Detachment immediately entered Dengzhou City. Beating gongs and drums, they posted and loudly read the notice to reassure the people issued by Sun Yuanhua. Thousands of commoners and soldiers who were left in the city and failed to board the ships, or were unwilling to follow the thieves and hid, came out from their hiding places to surrender one after another. Zhu Mingxia ordered to take them all in and send them to Zhaoyuan for settlement and screening.

The remaining materials in the city were also cleaned up. The cannons and military equipment that failed to be taken away were all collected, except for gunpowder which was discarded. Needless to say about grain, fodder, gold and silver.

The sea was boundless. More than a hundred ships carrying rebel soldiers looked after each other from head to tail, stretching for several li. Kong Youde, Li Jiucheng, Geng Zhongming and other main generals took separate ships, each commanding a part of the ships.

Sailing in winter, although there was a danger of straying into floating ice, the wind and waves on the sea surface were much smaller, and the sailing felt very smooth. It was just that the sea breeze was exceptionally piercing, blowing on the face like a knife cut.

Kong Youde looked back at Dengzhou City getting farther and farther away, feeling only blankness in his heart—since raising the army in Wuqiao, more than a year bad passed. He had fought victorious battles and suffered defeats, living a "most satisfying" life he had never lived before, but this kind of life always gave him a feeling of blankness—the future was misty, and he was at a loss.

Of the various strategies discussed with Li Jiucheng and others at the beginning, in the end only thousands of li of scorched earth and hundreds of thousands of corpses remained. Where the road ahead for himself and his nearly 20,000 subordinates should go, he couldn't see clearly.

Towards the Great Ming, he had no feelings to speak of. Although his official title and status were given by the Great Ming, this was also what he, his father, brothers and fellow villagers earned from the pile of dead bodies with knives and spears while enduring hunger; towards the Eastern Barbarians, they were enemies with deep-seated hatred.

However, the efforts of him, and also Li Jiucheng and other Dongjiang soldiers to seek a piece of territory for themselves had completely failed. Now, they had drawn a circle and returned to the starting point—the islands along the coast of Liaodong where Commander Mao took them to flee back then.

These islands were very barren, and grain and pay had no way to be replenished. what should be done in the future? Ask for amnesty from the Great Ming, or secretly communicate with the Eastern Barbarians?

He was thinking when suddenly someone reported:

"Vice Marshal! There are a large number of ships on the sea surface! They are closing in on us!"

Kong Youde went out of the cabin to look, and saw four plumes of black smoke rushing straight into the sky at the horizon. He couldn't help being stunned: These are Manor Lord Lu's ships!

Looking at the ships approaching on the sea surface, in an instant he understood everything—Manor Lord Lu had deceived them!

No, saying deceived was not accurate. To be precise, Manor Lord Lu had set up a situation at every step that they had to walk like this. Perhaps, they had no choice from the very beginning!

Kong Youde's hands tightly gripped the railing, almost digging his fingertips into the wood.

The Second Fleet had long been ambushing near the Changshan Archipelago. As soon as they saw the rebels go out to sea, and the wind direction was suitable, the Second Fleet immediately dispatched all members and began the encirclement and arrest operation from both wings simultaneously.

Chen Youshi's subordinates on Guanglu Island, who had received news in advance, never waited for the rebel fleet from Dengzhou—the rebel fleet was held hostage by the Second Fleet. After burning a ship that attempted to escape with rockets, the fleet sailed towards Jeju Island under the "escort" of the Second Fleet.

At the Chaotianpu Wharf, the garrison, having received news that the prisoners were about to arrive, had fully mobilized—after all, these were 20,000 soldiers, all carrying weapons. The number of regular troops on Jeju Island was limited, so effectively disarming 20,000 people was still quite challenging.

Most of the armed forces on Jeju Island had been concentrated near the wharf specially built for prisoners to land: two infantry companies of the Northbound Detachment Jeju Island Detachment; two companies of the Security Army Sword Drawing Unit; two companies of the Security Army White Horse Unit. There were also three thousand militia selected from Shandong immigrants—all of whom had blood feuds with the rebels. The Navy sent several sailor companies and a "Typewriter" (machine gun) squad as support.

Fences and passages allowing only one person to pass had been formed with barbed wire on the wharf. Around the passages, bayonets and spears were like a forest, cannon muzzles flashed, and on the watchtowers around stood marksmen carrying sniper rifles... Everything was quiet, just waiting for the first batch of rebel transport ships to enter the port.

Feng Zongze brought his own team to personally sit in command at Chaotianpu. He brought not only infantry and the Security Army, but also artillery and the Teaching Cavalry Squad. The cannons of the former were all loaded with double canister shots—if the situation became uncontrollable by infantry, he was prepared to follow Napoleon's old trick, directly bombarding the rioters with cannons, and then letting the Teaching Cavalry Squad charge over to kill. Of course, this possibility was extremely small. Before his cannons could "speak", the Typewriters would probably be enough to suppress these people.

"Chief, the fleet is here." Park Chang-fan said respectfully.

"I see it." Feng Zongze raised his telescope and squinted for a while, "Order: All units enter alert state!"

At this time, the rebel fleet appeared on the horizon, one after another, approaching the coast under the "escort" of the Second Fleet. The gunners on the patrol boats and batteries watched these tattered ships vigilantly—they were crowded with soldiers wearing dirty and tattered cotton armor and rough iron armor. Each of them had wavering eyes and dim faces.

The first batch of ships docked at the trestle, and the loudspeakers installed on the wharf began to broadcast on a loop—the broadcaster was a former Dongjiang soldier:

"...Dongjiang and Shandong soldiers! You have arrived at Jeju Prefecture of the Great Song. As long as you obey commands and act according to our instructions, the Great Song guarantees your personal safety. Get off the ship one by one, line up and walk forward. Put down your weapons and take off your armor at the designated place. Do not make mistakes..."

The soldiers on the ship hesitated for a moment and then began to disembark, walking in teams towards the passages enclosed by barbed wire fences. Along the way, under the direction of the loudspeakers, they put down the weapons they carried, took off their armor, and entered the purification camp to wait for purification. Those who looked like officers were taken away locally.

The entire disarmament operation was quiet and rapid. occasionally there would be some noise somewhere, followed by a gunshot declaring silence again—any such behavior would be ended directly by a bullet from the watchtower.

Those killed were dragged into the open space under the barbed wire by hook poles as a silent warning. After disarmament, each person received a vegetable and potato pancake and a cup of hot tea brewed with herbs that had a calming effect. The potato pancake was made by steaming a mixture of cabbage and mashed potatoes. For the soldiers who were starving and rarely had a proper meal, it was no less than a delicious delicacy. As for the herbal tea with calming effect, it was nothing more than to make them listless.
