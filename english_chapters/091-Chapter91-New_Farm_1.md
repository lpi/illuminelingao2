# Chapter 91 - New Farm (1)

The transmigrators' meals from D-Day onwards were rice + seafood. After eating all kinds of seafood in various ways for a month continuously, few people were still interested in these things. Even the seafood rice originated by Wu De, he himself began to feel extremely bored after eating for two weeks. Although later under his auspices, some improvements were made in meals, such as making smoked fish, fish sauce, and fish cake, some of these things took a long time to mature, and some lacked necessary seasonings—everyone thought of bringing enough salt, but removed soy sauce, sugar, vinegar, cooking wine, and spices from the reserve. In the view of many people, these were products with no technical difficulty, and they could completely set up factories to produce, plant, or buy them after transmigration—they forgot that these things could not be available immediately, but they had to eat every day.

The result was that whether it was smoked fish or fish cake, the taste was weird, making it hard for people to raise interest. Sometimes the Food Office also improved the meals, using various canned foods in the reserve, but the quantity was really a bit small relative to the population base—a can of luncheon meat for two people would definitely be greasy, but a can of luncheon meat for ten people was almost equivalent to no one eating it.

One day, Wu Nanhai sneakily sent a smoked sausage to Wu De. This thing he wouldn't even want to look at in another space-time made him feel extremely delicious—although there was not even pepper inside, just some garlic. Wu Nanhai also repeatedly asked him to keep it secret, especially in front of that Nick—this was smoked horse meat sausage made from his "Blue Lightning". The remains of this Australian racehorse were secretly corrupted as the private goods of the Agricultural Committee. And the grave of the racehorse where Nick would go to mourn when free was empty, even the bones were secretly collected—Wu Nanhai planned to use it to make bone meal fertilizer.

Beating back the "First Encirclement and Suppression"—after the issuance of "Lingao Express", everyone called that counterattack so—the few dead horses dragged back afterwards became their first real improvement of meals in more than a month. And the six pigs sent by local gentry this time became a rare delicacy in the cafeteria.

However, for Wu Nanhai and the others, there was still a slight disappointment. These pigs were far worse than what they saw in another space-time. They were small and thin, with hard bristles, looking a bit like wild boars.

"Don't look down on them," Xiong Buyou, who drove the pigs over with people, swallowed saliva while looking at a few piglets, "This is Lingao pig, a famous local specialty, always exported to Hong Kong. Know Lingao suckling pig? It's this kind of pig, thin skin and small bones, tender meat, and has a special aroma—"

He looked around at the few piglets with greedy eyes like a big gray wolf: "These few are all thirteen or fourteen jin, just right. Roasted, they must be fat and tender."

"Don't get any funny ideas. I intended to raise the piglets as breeding pigs. Since you say this pig breed is so good, then we must keep them even more."

"Are all the big pigs slaughtered?"

"Correct, let everyone have a feast. I asked the Executive Committee for instructions," Wu Nanhai looked at the few pigs still rooting for food unaware that their lives were about to end, "Originally wanted to kill two, but the Executive Committee said if killing, might as well slaughter all six big pigs. Instead of letting people only eat a small slice of meat, it's better for everyone to eat happily, considered as a reward."

Wu Nanhai had already calculated the plan for those gifts sent: two hundred jin of wine was low-degree rice wine, which could be used as cooking wine or vinegar; the soup deer was already a slaughtered carcass, so make jerky. This food is easy to make. Although there are no spices, the taste is okay after boiling thoroughly with salt water and air-drying. It is easy to carry and can be preserved for a long time. Pity the deer was sent after being killed; deer skin and deer guts were gone. One cow was a female yellow cow, not strong enough to be a draft animal in the southern paddy fields, but could be a local maternal line for future beef cattle and dairy cows. Six big pigs were finished meat pigs, couldn't be breeding pigs. Although there was still room for fattening, lacking feed right now, keeping them would only lose fat in vain, so simply slaughter and eat.

As for how to utilize these few pigs, everyone had listed many plans: pork belly and rib meat were all made into red braised pork; pig head meat made into pot-stewed meat—but temporarily no spices to use, store in the refrigerator first with high-grade goods like pork chops and tenderloin—removed from the kitchen of Fengcheng ship. Pig trotters and small ribs could be used to make soup; leg meat and picnic shoulder meat used to make minced meat; all fat meat rendered into lard, oil residue used for stir-frying vegetables, pig bones used to boil soup. Brains and spinal cords were all knocked out separately for use. Pig blood and internal organs guts were all delicious. Inedible guts: pig pancreas, bladder, gall, and spleen etc. all had other uses, also frozen first. Finally, even pig skin was prepared to be fried into puffed pig skin for cooking—Wu Nanhai really wanted the complaints about meals to stop for a few days. Finally, things really inedible were given to Wu Nanhai to dry and make feed powder.

Such a comprehensive utilization plan encountered a big problem—no one knew how to kill pigs. For these transmigrators, pigs were fresh red meat on the cutting board in the vegetable market or in the supermarket freezer. How to turn live pigs into pork became a difficult mystery to solve.

Wu Nanhai found Yang Baogui. Because he had successfully helped the Food Office dissect and divide several dead horses, everyone naturally thought the task of killing pigs could also be given to him. However, Veterinarian Yang shook his head repeatedly, saying taking the life of a pig is easy, but killing a pig is a technical job. If not done well, pork would be wasted in vain. He also cited the example of the European Union. Because of implementing animal humanitarianism, the EU insisted on changing the pig killing method continued for thousands of years to the electric shock method conforming to animal humanitarianism. As a result, EU pork is now super terrible to eat.

Finally, the veterans of the Military Team solved this problem: which company doesn't raise pigs? When improving meals during the New Year, the cooking squad organized pig killing themselves. Some people even helped in the cooking squad. Several veterans rolled up their sleeves, boiled a large pot of water, and slaughtered the pigs at once.

A quarantine team formed by Yang Baogui and Shi Niaoren conducted relevant quarantine on the spot and considered these pigs relatively healthy. No serious parasitic infection, but still instructed that all meat must be cooked thoroughly.

That evening, several large pots of red braised pork were cooked in the cafeteria. Red braised pork seasoned only with salt, soy sauce—still very poor solid soy sauce—and cooking wine won unanimous praise from everyone. Even girls who were always afraid of gaining weight and didn't like eating meat joined the chorus of fighting for more and complaining about less. Wu Nanhai saw someone actually eating until tears flowed out.

"Meat is still the most delicious." This was the conclusion reached unanimously by many transmigrators who had eaten seafood for nearly 2 months.

But these few pots of red braised pork also used up the last bit of soy sauce they found from the ship's kitchen. Wu Nanhai planned to find a place to buy some things like soy sauce and seasonings—he had brought strains for fermentation. But there were too many things for the Agricultural Committee right now.

With the entire industrial center shifting to Bairen Beach, various supporting buildings were completed one after another. various belongings of the Agricultural Committee also had to be transferred to Bairen City. Wu Nanhai went back and forth between the two places every day, cleaning and transporting items. Although he was one of the executive committee members, he rarely called Beijing 212 according to rank, but always tried to take agricultural vehicles between the two places. After moving, what remained of the Agricultural Committee in Bopu was only the Bopu cafeteria guarded by a Food Office staff and the Fishery Production Group managed by Chen Haiyang, a former navy and current fisherman. Chen Haiyang submitted a report to the Executive Committee: requesting to establish a navy with the existing ships and personnel of the Fishery Group as the core, concurrently engaging in fishing industry. Bopu camp area could be managed by the navy. As for future maritime trade, shipbuilding, etc., they could also be managed by the navy.

Navy! Wu Nanhai thought, even the problem of eating hasn't been settled yet, someone already wants to build a navy. Seeing the tent where he lived for more than a month had been demolished, he couldn't help feeling a bit sad. He threw the few bundles of nylon nets Wu De gave him onto the agricultural vehicle. Wu De, this fisherman, was now happily acting as his labor reform captain, tossing those natives every day, working and brainwashing. If he continued in the Fishery Group, how could Chen Haiyang suddenly pop up to build some navy.

Behind this agricultural vehicle was a long string of two-wheeled carts left by militia in the counterattack, on which various belongings of the Agriculture Group were tied messily: small farm tools, irrigation and drainage equipment, sprayers, a full set of agricultural technology experimental equipment, veterinary instruments, seeds, and many cages containing livestock and poultry like chickens, ducks, and rabbits... The agricultural vehicle had already degenerated into the trend of a train here. Although he didn't understand cars very well, he thought this definitely wouldn't work. Just make do in difficult times. Hope this vehicle can hold up before all items are transported.

Yang Baogui waved a self-made whip, commanding the six dogs under his command by the roadside to run back and forth driving the newly formed marching formation: several pigs, a pair of donkeys, and three horses. These large animals couldn't enjoy the treatment of riding cars and would go to their new home by marching on foot. These breeding stocks were very precious. The Military Team sent seven or eight people to escort them.

"Old Yang, hard work." Wu Nanhai walked to his side, "Let's walk together." Livestock breeding was not his major. He wanted to take this opportunity to chat well with the veterinarian.

"Very far, have to walk ten or so kilometers. Can your body stand it?" Yang Baogui looked at his slightly plump body.

"What are you saying, I am younger than you." This dark-skinned man with a pair of black-framed resin glasses on his nose looked at least thirty-seven or thirty-eight.

"I am a vet, and a rural vet. Walking ten or so kilometers a day is a piece of cake. Although now every village has roads, cars, well, there is always only one. And it's always driven by people who don't go out for consultation." Yang Baogui shook his flat-top parted hair. Wu Nanhai found that he, like himself, tied the two legs of his glasses with a rope and hung them around his neck. This common point greatly increased his favorability.
