# Chapter 17 - Old Worker

Chapter 17 Old Worker

At the modern training base, besides young and strong Transmigrators, there was also a special group - the "Old Workers".

Most of them were the parents or elders of the Transmigrators. They were originally going to enjoy their retirement life, but were pulled into this crazy plan by their children.

"Dad, Mom, come with us. The air there is good, the food is safe, and you can live a few more years." The children persuaded like this.

For the sake of family affection, or curiosity about the new world, these old people resolutely embarked on the journey of time travel.

Among them was an old man named "Mo Xiaobai". He was the father of a member of the industrial group.

Old Mo was a retired senior fitter in a state-owned factory. He had dealt with machines all his life and had excellent skills. He could process high-precision parts with a file.

In the eyes of young people, these traditional skills were already outdated, replaced by CNC machine tools and 3D printing.

However, in the conditions of time travel, these "outdated" skills became invaluable treasures.

When the industrial group was discussing the equipment list, Old Mo sat in the corner and listened silently.

"We need 5-axis CNC machine tools!" A young engineer shouted, "Only then can we manufacture high-end equipment!"

"Naive." Old Mo snorted coldly, "Do you have electricity? Do you have a control system? Do you have maintenance capabilities? Once a 5-axis machine tool breaks down in the Ming Dynasty, it's a pile of scrap iron."

"Then what should we do?" The young engineer asked unconvinced.

"Bring ordinary machine tools." Old Mo said slowly, "Lathes, milling machines, planers, drilling machines... The simpler the structure, the better. Pure mechanical transmission is best. Don't engage in those electronic controls. They are not reliable."

"Also," Old Mo continued, "Bring more files, scrapers, hand drills and other hand tools. When there is no electricity or machines break down, these are the guys you rely on for survival."

The young people looked at each other, feeling that what the old man said made sense.

So, the equipment list was revised substantially. A large number of high-end equipment was removed and replaced by sturdy and durable traditional general-purpose machine tools and hand tools.

Old Mo not only gave advice but also personally participated in the procurement and maintenance of equipment.

He took a group of young people to the second-hand equipment market to pick and choose.

"This lathe has a hard bed, good precision, want it."
"That milling machine has worn gears, don't want it."

Under Old Mo's fiery eyes, they bought a batch of high-quality and cheap second-hand equipment.

After buying them back, Old Mo led everyone to disassemble, clean, repair and refit these equipment.

"Look carefully." Old Mo held a wrench and demonstrated while explaining, "The clearance of this bearing should be adjusted just right. Too tight will heat up, too loose will vibrate..."

The young engineers who were used to operating computers were stunned by the old man's skills. They realized that the gap between theory and practice was so big.

"Master Mo, you are amazing!" They praised sincerely.

Old Mo smiled, full of wrinkles on his face: "I'm old and useless. I can only help you tighten a few screws. The future world depends on you young people."

Besides Old Mo, there were many "Old Workers" with unique skills.

There were old farmers who knew how to raise pigs and grow vegetables;
There were old Chinese medicine doctors who knew how to recognize herbs and acupuncture;
There were old tailors who knew how to cut and sew;
There were old cooks who knew how to pickle vegetables and make sauce...

They might not understand high technology or modern management, but they possessed the traditional wisdom and survival skills most needed in the agricultural society.

In the preparations for time travel, they played an irreplaceable role.

They taught young people how to identify grains, how to make soy sauce, how to make clothes, how to treat minor illnesses...

These skills, seemingly inconspicuous in modern society, were the foundation for the Transmigrators to settle down in the Ming Dynasty.

"Treasure these old people." Wen Desi said with emotion at a meeting, "They are our precious wealth. Their experience is the bridge connecting the new and old worlds."

With the participation of the Old Workers, the preparation work of the Transmigrators became more solid and comprehensive. They were not only prepared materially but also inherited skills.

When the horn of crossing sounded, Old Mo and other old people, supporting each other, followed the children's footsteps and stepped into the wormhole firmly.

They knew that there would be hardships and dangers ahead, but as long as the family was together, there was nothing to fear.

They would use their remaining heat to contribute the last strength to building a new home in a foreign land.
