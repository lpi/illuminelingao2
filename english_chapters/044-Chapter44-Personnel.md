# Chapter 44: Personnel

"All settled. Put them in Room 106 of Building 7." Xiao Zishan held up his folder, making a show of consulting it. Actually, he remembered without looking—this was just a leftover habit from years of white-collar meetings.

"Meng Xian, twenty-five years old, has been abroad, proficient in English, studied finance and accounting.

"Pan Feng, twenty-eight, unemployed. Claims to have worked as a fast-moving consumer goods representative. Single.

"Zha Wuchu, twenty-four, pharmaceutical technician. Single.

"Tian Jiujiu, twenty-seven, Water Conservancy Design Institute of *X* Province *Y* City, technician, water supply and drainage specialty. Single."

"Great—except for one useless one, they're all useful professionals." Wei Aiwen slapped the table happily, deliberately glancing at Xiao Zishan.

Xiao Zishan naturally knew what he meant. In his heart, he despised this loudmouth. But he never let the contempt show on his face, nor did he argue openly. He knew clearly: even for a card game, he didn't belong in this room.

The others just nodded silently. Xiao Zishan continued his report:

"Chatted casually with all of them. Everyone's very enthusiastic about crossing over; attitudes seem quite firm."

The so-called "chat" was the Executive Committee's first screening of newcomers. Through welcoming conversation, they roughly assessed each person's background and personality—whether they had sufficient teamwork spirit and emotional intelligence to join this unprecedented adventure.

"Meng Xian, extremely fond of light weapons. Trained in moving-target shooting at sports school for several years. Talked about enjoying firearms.

"Pan Feng, spoke little during the process. Rather introverted. Hobbies include gardening and history. Knows the fast-moving consumer goods industry well. Has an accountant's license.

"Tian Jiujiu, ..."

After briefly introducing his impressions and views on these newcomers, Xiao Zishan also provided the Committee with an inventory of their declared personal belongings.

"I've written a basic summary. I'll submit it along with the registration forms to the Internal Affairs Group tonight. They'll conduct the next round of evaluation and screening. Someone has already been assigned to room with them."

"Who was assigned?" Wen Desi asked.

"That I don't know—Internal Affairs handles the rest from here." Xiao Zishan spread his hands. "Shall I ask?"

"No need." Wen Desi, Ma Qianzhu, and Xiao Zishan's glances briefly intersected.

"So, as of now, 476 people have effectively reported in."

Personnel concentration had begun about six months ago, with people arriving almost weekly. They'd all gone through the same process as Meng Xian's group.

Of the 2,106 people who had enthusiastically discussed and replied to posts about crossing the wormhole, fewer than 800 joined the subsequent Skype chat group. Those who actually came here and stayed numbered under 500.

"Many dropped out?"

"About 50 or so in total. The 476 are those currently committed to crossing." Xiao Zishan checked the list. "Over the next two weeks, about 50 more should arrive. These should all come."

"'A Thousand Talents' is becoming 'Five Hundred Talents Hall.'" Wei Aiwen sighed. "Too few people. Everyone talks big, but when it comes to actually doing something, they're all damn cowards!"

The others said nothing. Whether more or fewer people was better—that was a paradox. For these people occupying Executive Committee positions, fewer might actually be advantageous. More people meant more opinions. After all, though all planning was handled by the Executive Committee, there'd been no input from the masses. The masses currently followed the Committee's arrangements only because of the docility that comes with arriving somewhere unfamiliar. Once everyone got to know each other, who knew what trouble might arise.

"Better to keep the team lean." Ma Qianzhu laughed it off.

"On the bright side, we do have talent in all areas—nothing we lack." Xiao Zishan said with some satisfaction. "Just fewer women. Most are accompanying husbands or boyfriends; not many singles."

"Naturally—mostly bachelors coming." Wen Desi tilted his head back. "Anyone with a family wouldn't run off to do this..."

Wei Aiwen said: "Women are just trouble, whining and moaning all day."

"Then don't ask the organization for a wife later. We don't handle that."

"Who needs it? Ancient little lolis—I'll have as many as I want. One to massage my back, one to rub my waist, and one to..."

Xi Yazhou interrupted impatiently: "'I' this and 'I' that—you're just a kid, always saying 'I' like you're big stuff. With that attitude, no woman would want you!"

"No problem, Little Wei—the Ming has a thriving 'Brokeback Mountain' scene, and only high-quality talents indulge..."

"Bullshit! *You're* Brokeback Mountain! Your whole family's Brokeback Mountain!" The young man flared up—teasing him had become a habit here.

"Actually, I have a question for the Committee," Xiao Zishan said. "About foreigners."

"Foreigners? No! Too much trouble later!"

"I'm against foreigners too. Those not of our race must have different hearts!"

"This case is special." Xiao Zishan continued.

"Don't tell me it's a military medic who served in Iraq. If so, we might consider."

"No... it's a registrant's girlfriend." Xiao Zishan pulled out a sheet from his folder and read: "Ding Ding, male, 32, Han ethnicity, reporter for a major media group. The foreign woman is called... Panpan? Apparently American."

"Whoa, a Western mare!" Wei Aiwen leaned in eagerly. "Any photos? Any photos?"

"She's someone else's girlfriend. What are you getting excited about? Go sit down."

"She needs to be investigated! Might be an American spy." Wei Aiwen gesticulated wildly. "Definitely sent by the FBI to infiltrate us—to stop us from rewriting history!"

"Little Wei, do you know what the FBI does?" The know-it-all Luo Duo came to correct his technical error.

"Anyway, it's some American spy organization. Also protects the president!"

"Want to be the one to investigate her?"

"I'll definitely complete the task assigned by the organization!" The young man assured them with sincere earnestness. Zhong Lishi, who'd been teasing him, felt embarrassed to continue seeing his serious expression.

Wen Desi nodded: "Personally, I agree. Since she's family to one of our people, let her come along. Even if she wanted to serve America, there'd be nowhere to serve.

"Alright. I'll confirm with him. Come to think of it, we don't have anyone in media and publicity. Could be useful in the future."

"We need professionals in every field—and ordinary people too." Wen Desi emphasized. "When receiving new arrivals, be careful not to be warmer to those with expertise and colder to those without. That's not good."

"I understand. Unity matters."

Meng Xian lay on the iron bunk bed in the dorm, staring at his large duffel bag on the upper bunk. Outside was utterly quiet; he could clearly hear sounds from a porn video someone was watching upstairs.

All the enthusiasm of the journey here—once things went quiet—was replaced by an irrepressible unease.

*What's wrong with me... Have I gone crazy? Good job in America, and I leave it to come to some village in Guangdong. What exactly am I trying to do?*

*Change fate? Remake history?*

Meng Xian usually enjoyed alternate-history novels and had fantasized about crossing into another era to rebuild China, establish great achievements, and acquire three or four wives. But he knew it was just fiction.

Once through the wormhole, he would vanish from this world—as good as dead.

Parents, relatives, friends, and a future wife... Of course, he didn't even have a girlfriend now, let alone a wife. But! If he hadn't come here, a decent wife was still a possibility...

At this thought, Meng Xian almost felt the impulse to withdraw. He sat up abruptly. He saw Ye Yuming on the next bed also spacing out. Ye had moved into the dorm before them.

"What—can't sleep?" Seeing him sit up, Ye Yuming tossed him a cigarette.

"I don't smoke..."

"Never mind then. I'll quit too. What's up—not going to play online?"

"Don't feel like it." Meng Xian sighed. "No idea when we'll actually leave." The words were somewhat insincere, yet not entirely untrue—once they actually crossed, he'd be resigned to it. This limbo was the hardest.

"You really look forward to D-Day that much?"

"Don't you?"

"Hard to say... Feels unreliable." Ye Yuming sniffed his cigarette. "If Director Wen and Mr. Ma weren't people I trust, plus..." he paused, "I'd almost worry it's a scam."

"Surely not." Meng Xian's confidence wavered slightly.

"Yeah, I think not either. That's why I came. But what happens over there—really hard to say."

"Hasn't Director Wen already taken people over many times?"

"But with so many people, and so much stuff... What if the energy explodes? Or something goes wrong after crossing..." Ye Yuming's expression turned grave. "If you die, there's no LOAD game."

"Maybe you respawn in the original timeline?" Pan Feng, who'd been reading on the side, suddenly interjected.

"Haha, you're something else." Ye Yuming and Meng Xian both laughed.

Pan Feng put down his book and sat up: "According to typical transmigration tropes, isn't it always struck by lightning, hit by a car, drowned? So if you die in the other timespace, you should respawn in this one."

"If there's a Time-Space Administration, apply for resurrection right after you die." Meng Xian laughed for a while, feeling slightly lighter. "Xiao Pan, you said you were in sales—selling what?"

"Me? Don't laugh—my longest sales gig was selling sanitary napkins."

Everyone in the dorm burst out laughing. Zha Wuchu slapped the bed frame, laughing: "You're making that up! You sell sanitary napkins? What girl would buy from you..."

Pan Feng picked up the cigarette Meng Xian had set aside: "Mind if I have one?"

"Go ahead, go ahead." Ye Yuming even lit it for him, then took one himself.

Pan Feng took a drag: "I was in channel sales—selling directly to wholesalers. Nothing to do with girls... The FMCG business gets harder every year. More competitors, pickier customers, higher company demands—only the salary stays the same forever..."

"You think this is legit?" Ye Yuming pressed.

Pan Feng glanced at him, a smile playing at the corner of his mouth.

"Why wouldn't it be? Unless Director Wen's gone mental, why would he do all this? To scam money? At this scale, he'd be losing his own shirt."

"So you really want to cross?" Ye Yuming followed up immediately.

"Cross. Why not?" Pan Feng flicked his ash. "I'm the working poor. Went to college, work diligently enough. All these years of effort, only earn a bit of cash, gotta save for emergencies, get married, buy a house, become a mortgage slave. Complain a little and someone tells you to go swim the Pacific for a few cents. I'm too timid—been a good citizen all my life. In this timeline, I don't dare do anything illegal. But living's depressing, so I came to take a risk."

The dorm fell silent. These words had touched something in everyone's heart. Ye Yuming smiled faintly, lay down, and began mentally drafting his report for the Internal Affairs Group.
