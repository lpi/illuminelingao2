"Comrades, our goal is to build a modern country." At the inauguration ceremony, Wen Desi said impassionedly, "This requires the joint efforts of each of us."

"We must give full play to our professional expertise and turn knowledge into productivity."

"We must unite as one and overcome all difficulties."

"For the new world! For the future!"

The Ministry of Industry began to build factories. Steel plants, cement plants, machinery plants... chimneys rose from the ground.
The Ministry of Agriculture began to reclaim wasteland. Tractors roared in the fields, turning patches of wasteland into fertile fields.
The Ministry of Military Affairs began to recruit soldiers. A recruitment notice was posted at the gate of the county seat: "Recruiting soldiers, monthly payment 2 taels of silver, three meals a day with meat!"
The Ministry of Education began to run schools. "Lingao Elementary School" opened, enrolling children of Transmigrators and locals for free.
