# Chapter 348 - Energy Usage

The coking plant of the metallurgical department itself also produced coal gas, but this gas was basically all used in metallurgy and metal processing, with no spare capacity to supply other departments. Moreover, the distance was excessive. To lay gas pipelines with good sealing for long-distance gas transmission and manufacture gas tanks for gas storage... Transmigrators hadn't reached this industrial level yet. Therefore, Wang Luobin designed the industrial and agricultural coal gas furnace with the starting point of being able to utilize coal gas locally.

Wang Luobin had a lot of coal gas furnace materials on hand, especially indigenous method coal gas furnace materials, which could be called colorful and full of whimsical ideas. But he didn't trust these materials. Indigenous method coal gas furnaces blossomed everywhere during the Great Leap Forward era, touted extravagantly, but left no trace once the movement passed. Obviously, there were problems in terms of economy, safety, or practicality. He used to live in the countryside and experienced countless similar "technology promotions", such as biogas digesters, indigenous solar cookers... In the end, they all vanished or became half-dead for various reasons.

It could be seen that the promotion of a new technology had to take into account many factors, and the most important were practicality and economy. Neither could be dispensed with.

Therefore, in the selection and structural design of the coal gas generator, he discarded all contents that were too "indigenous" and made it as "modern" as possible within the scope permitted by the transmigrators' industrial capability to ensure its effective application.

He chose a flat-suction circular furnace for the food processing factory, with a diameter of 1.5 meters and a height of 3.5 meters. Using a blower for air supply, this furnace had a large hearth, uniform distribution of air and fuel, high gasification intensity, and could gasify 60 kilograms of coal per hour. Required materials: refractory bricks, red bricks, cement, and cast iron, all of which could be provided by the industrial department. The sealing method adopted a water seal, simple and safe. The hardest thing to make was nothing more than the check valve—this was a cast iron piece, with almost no difficulty.

After coal gas was produced, it first passed through a brick-built cyclone dust collector for dust removal, then washed with water to remove tar and dust. The clean coal gas generated after cooling was supplied to the diesel engine for use. The wastewater used for washing, containing a large amount of tar, was recovered and treated by the chemical department.

A high-power steam generator was also installed inside the furnace, utilizing the heat of the gasifier to generate steam during fuel gasification, thus also solving part of the food processing factory's demand for steam.

To facilitate ventilation and avoid carbon monoxide poisoning, the coal gas furnace was built under an open shed. The coal gas generator, blower, and diesel engine were integrated into a power workshop. The gas-driven diesel engine drove a belt to rotate a horizontal shaft for transmission. Various machinery and equipment could be driven as long as the belts on their flywheels were connected to the horizontal shaft. This 22-horsepower Changchai engine was enough to meet all the power needs of the food processing factory—including the demand of the blower maintaining the coal gas furnace operation.

The furnace was successfully ignited at once after construction, using coal from Leizhou. After winning the sugar war, the Leizhou Sugar Industry Company made persistent efforts and took the opportunity of Master Zhu's whole family being killed to directly swallow Master Zhu's shipping firm. Besides transporting sugar to Guangzhou and Lingao, a dozen large ships also took care of transporting coal—all purchased by Chang Shide's men from the local area and nearby Gaozhou and Lianzhou. This coal was relatively low quality, just suitable for gasification.

Another advantage of the coal gas furnace was that requirements for the stoker were not high; there was no technology to speak of, just act strictly according to regulations. Feeding material wasn't heavy work either, unlike burning boilers which required adding coal constantly. Wu Nanhai selected an old man in his fifties from the semi-labor force of Bairen Commune to manage this matter. Although he looked very old, he still had strength, sharp ears and eyes, and wasn't muddled.

At the moment of igniting the coal gas furnace, Wang Luobin personally used the hand crank to start the diesel engine. After the diesel engine crackled a few times, it ran "chug-chug", feeling no different from using diesel.

Wang Luobin took the coal gas furnace of the food processing factory as a demonstration sample for coal gas furnaces.

Huang Dashan appreciated the coal gas furnace project very much—coal gas had high calorific value and stable heat generation, very favorable for controlling temperature. Engaging in fermentation and enzyme decomposition required quite harsh temperature requirements.

The coal gas furnace of the food processing factory greatly alleviated the consumption of biogas manufactured by the farm. Originally, this place was a big consumer of farm biogas. Biogas production from biogas digesters was very unstable. One of Wu Nanhai's biggest headaches was that although many biogas digesters were built, no matter how well designed or how large the capacity, problems of reduced gas supply would occur from time to time, sometimes simply stopping gas suddenly. Fuel had to be urgently called in to supplement.

Wang Luobin personally watched the furnace by its side for half a day, observing the combustion situation. After feeling everything was normal, he instructed Mo Xiaoan, "Hang bird cages in this shed and nearby workshops, raise a few birds."

"Raise birds for what?"

"As alarms, to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning." Birds had much lower tolerance for carbon monoxide than humans and could warn of carbon monoxide leaks.

"No need. The smell of coal gas leak is so strong; impossible not to smell it..."

Wang Luobin glanced at this Minister of Light Industry. "Carbon monoxide is colorless and odorless. That smell is added."

"Understood, understood." Mo Xiaoan sweated profusely—wasn't this making a fool of himself on the spot. "I'll arrange it right away."

Wang Luobin walked around the food factory again—he now had an important task to estimate the energy usage of the transmigrators, so as to coordinate various prime movers and energy currently in use to improve their utilization efficiency.

Among the prime movers currently used by the Transmigration Group, electric motors were the largest category, relying on two power stations and scattered wind turbines for power supply.

Electric energy was clean and convenient to use, and electric motors worked stably, naturally being the best choice for prime movers. However, in an internal assessment, the Industrial and Energy Committee believed that self-production of electric motors and various power-related equipment, including generators, transformers, converters, cables... had great difficulty—this difficulty was mainly reflected in materials. Especially the silicon steel sheets used by electric motors, far from being manufacturable by general indigenous methods. In terms of the Transmigration Group's industrial capability, manufacturing equipment wasn't difficult; the difficulty lay in that raw materials could only rely on brought reserves, with no replenishment once used up. Considering the need to supplement damaged equipment and repair equipment, these materials and parts must have a certain retention amount. Before overcoming these problems, electricity was obviously not the main development direction.

Besides electric motors, there were steam engines. Since the machinery factory mass-produced the 50-horsepower Mozi Type II, this kind of machine had gradually been promoted in various places. Steam engines had the worst efficiency but won in low technical content. Burning boilers could use various fuels. It was the main power source for transmigrators in the near stage.

As for diesel engines, gasoline engines, etc., they relied on reserved petroleum fuel. Now after gradually realizing their "gasification", they would have broad application prospects. Although the internal combustion engines they possessed had relatively small output power, they had advantages of small volume, light weight, and convenient mobility, much more convenient in application than the heavy power combination of Steam Engine + Boiler. Coal gas generators could be large or small, flexibly configured, and didn't have high demands for fuel.

Promoting coal gas generators was just one link in this plan. Wang Luobin also planned to improve fuel usage efficiency through deep processing of fuel and modification of combustion devices.

Transmigrators used a wide variety of fuels. Apart from brought fuel oil and biogas manufactured by biogas digesters, the largest category of fuel was coal. From steam engine boilers to canteen cooking fires, its figure was indispensable. Next were various wood scraps, sawdust, straw, etc. Various fuels had different calorific values, and usage was also very extensive. Wang Luobin proposed in the plan to change the past practice where fuel distribution was arbitrary and without standards, changing to setting up a Fuel Factory. Except for biogas, various fuels would be uniformly pre-processed and then collected by various departments for use.

This Fuel Factory would temporarily set up a simple coal processing workshop, while receiving the original wood dry distillation kilns.

The coal processing workshop was responsible for washing coal transported from outside. Coal transported from Hong Gai and Guangdong was all mined by indigenous methods, mixed with a large amount of impurities. Moreover, coal quality varied; mixing coal with low intrinsic ash and high intrinsic ash together, and throwing them into boilers indiscriminately for combustion would cause great waste.

Through coal washing, impurities in raw coal were removed, then high-quality coal and low-quality coal were simply classified. Gangue was removed. Crushing coal according to usage could greatly improve coal usage efficiency.

Wood fuels, except for sawdust and materials that couldn't be dry distilled, would no longer be burned directly, but enter dry distillation kilns to be dry distilled into charcoal, improving combustion efficiency, reducing pollution, and simultaneously recovering wood tar. Waste heat from dry distillation kilns would simulate produce steam with evaporators to provide for factories in Bopu.

Besides coking coal, fuel coal and charcoal were uniformly converted into standard coal units for supply to various departments to accurately calculate the fuel usage situation of each department.

Straw and husk fuels were controlled and used by the Agricultural Committee themselves. Regarding husks, Wang Luobin suggested temporarily not using them as fuel—this thing contained a large amount of silicon dioxide, causing great pollution when burned. Utilizing it effectively as fuel required special devices.

For many stoves currently existing in canteens, factories, and even dormitories, except for biogas stoves, Wang Luobin decided to conduct a comprehensive investigation and registration, unify stove types, dismantle simple stoves with low utilization of fuel and heat energy, and simultaneously forcibly promote the use of honeycomb briquettes. The manufacturing technology of honeycomb briquettes was simple; utilizing the coal dust remaining at the bottom after screening coal in the fuel factory, grinding it once, mixing with yellow soil in proportion, they could be made with a simple hand-cranked briquette machine. Two or three workers could make several thousand a day, enough for these stoves to use.
