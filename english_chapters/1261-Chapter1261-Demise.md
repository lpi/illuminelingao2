# Chapter 1261 - Demise

On the small path at the foot of the hill, a 7.62mm bullet from a Mosin-Nagant rifle pierced Zheng Zhilong's chest. Before Tō Tarō and his group could react, two M77B1 rifles swept them with NATO rounds, instantly knocking down several Japanese mercenaries. Tō Tarō dodged the first burst because he had thrown himself to the ground in an attempt to support Zheng Zhilong.

Ignoring the bullets flying around him and his falling comrades, Tō Tarō reached under Zheng Zhilong's armpits and dragged him on his knees towards a large rock behind some nearby bushes. Once behind cover, he saw that not only had Zheng Zhilong been hit in the chest, but he had also taken a bullet in the leg. Blood gushed out, and bloody foam bubbled at the corner of his mouth; it was clear he wouldn't survive. Sorrow welled up in Tō Tarō's heart, and he couldn't help but shed tears.

Although Zheng Zhilong was mortally wounded, his mind remained clear. Knowing his end had come, he struggled to speak: "Life is like dew, destined to dissipate... You need not be too sorrowful... I started from storm and strife in my youth, and established this enterprise before I was thirty. It has not been a wasted journey..." Blood surged up his throat as he spoke, causing him to cough a few times, unable to continue. Tō Tarō hurriedly wiped it away. Zheng Zhilong rested for a moment, then forced himself to continue, "I just can't let go of Fusong..."

Holding back his tears, Tō Tarō said, "Your servant swears to follow the Young Master to the death and protect him!"

Zheng Zhilong nodded with difficulty. "I trust you. If things become impossible... try to take him back to Hirado, find..." He whispered a few words in a low voice.

"Your servant understands!"

"I am truly unwilling..." Zheng Zhilong withdrew his gaze, and before he could finish his sentence, he passed away.

Tears filled Tō Tarō's eyes, but there was no time for grief. The accompanying bodyguards and mercenaries were either dead or wounded. The ambushers would charge down at any moment. In this frantic situation, he could neither bury the body nor hide it. "The General's head must never be taken by the enemy"—this was the consistent creed of a samurai. He immediately drew his wakizashi, severed Zheng Zhilong's head, wrapped it in clothes, strapped it to his back, and fled into the tall grass.

By the time Qian Shuixie led his men to Observation Post 6, the gunfire had completely ceased. The team leader who had set up the ambush there gave him a brief report. Hearing that the sniper had hit a "young man who looked very much like the photo," Qian Shuixie's heart skipped a beat—was Zheng Zhilong really here?

He led his men scrambling down to the small path at the foot of the hill. Beside a large rock lay a dozen bodies. Judging by their weapons and equipment, they were clearly elite troops, especially since several were obviously Japanese. Japanese mercenaries were only found in Zheng Zhilong's personal guard; this group was undoubtedly his escort. The team members checked them; a few were still breathing but clearly wouldn't survive, and couldn't provide any information.

"Which one is the man who looked like Zheng Zhilong?" Qian Shuixie asked.

The problem was that none of the bodies on the ground matched Zheng Zhilong's photo. The sniper looked for a long time but couldn't recognize the person he had seen. The team members searched the area and went behind the large rock, discovering a headless corpse. Judging from the wounds on the chest and leg, it had indeed been hit by a Mosin-Nagant rifle.

Qian Shuixie went over and examined it carefully. Although the head was gone, and the body was wearing the homespun trousers and jacket common to Zheng's soldiers, the fact that the head had been taken was very telling—there was absolutely no practice of cutting off one's own fallen personnel's head without reason, unless this person was a VIP, and the other side, unable to bury the body in time and unwilling to let the General's head be taken by the enemy, resorted to such an extreme measure.

From this, it seemed very likely that this person was Zheng Zhilong! Qian Shuixie carefully observed the surroundings and found drag marks on the ground. Clearly, this person had been dragged behind the large rock after being hit. With so many people left unassisted, the fact that only this person was helped indicated his status was higher than the others...

If not him, this person was likely a key figure in the Zheng group, possibly one of the Eighteen Chi.

"Search these bodies."

Almost everyone carried some gold and silver valuables, but there was nothing to prove their identity. The body without the head was clean, carrying nothing, which aroused suspicion. However, the search revealed a second piece of evidence suggesting this person might be Zheng Zhilong or another VIP: under the rough outer clothes, he wore undergarments made of fine silk—very inconsistent with the rough homespun exterior.

Qian Shuixie took out his Casio card camera and photographed the entire scene. He then ordered the headless corpse to be buried separately by the large rock and marked. Since the head had been taken, eliminating the possibility of verifying identity, there was no need to transport it back.

Although he subsequently reported "suspected killing of Zheng Zhilong" to the *Lichun*, he continued to enforce the blockade in the direction of Wulao Mountain to prevent any other slip-throughs.

Mateus's team, chased all the way by Shi Zhiqi, finally collapsed completely. Mateus and a portion of his men managed to flee to the dock, seized two boats, and escaped. The rest were either killed or captured. Those lucky enough to escape lost their organization and scattered into the forests.

Subsequent fleets arrived one after another. Heavy artillery units, the Army, and logistics columns landed in succession. Although there were no targets left on the island worth attacking, many stragglers of the Zheng army remained scattered across Xiamen Island. Several Zheng family fortresses had not yet been occupied. The arrival of the follow-up troops was just in time to carry out the subsequent security operations.

Gulangyu fell later that day. The First Expeditionary Force waited until the follow-up troops landed before beginning the crossing. They occupied Gulangyu without meeting resistance; the garrison on this small island had already fled in panic.

As an intelligence officer, Xu Ke was the first to step onto Gulangyu after the battle ended. This "Piano Island" was currently just a desolate small island, lacking any artistic atmosphere aside from a few fishing villages.

This small island southwest of Xiamen Island was almost entirely formed of rock, with an area of only four square kilometers. Xu Ke climbed the island's highest point, Sunlight Rock.

The surface of the rock was dyed a pale gold color. Strangely, the sunlight shining on it didn't reflect, as if it were entirely absorbed.

"No wonder people call it Sunlight Rock!" Xu Ke said, looking up at the slightly angular giant rock on the hill. Not far from this rock, round boulders were densely packed together.

Looking down at the whole island from here, one could see that the Zheng family had invested significantly in this small island. Not only had they built fortresses, but they had also established large-scale weapons workshops and a shipyard. There was nothing much to say about the shipyard; it built large Fu ships and Guang ships using traditional Chinese shipbuilding methods. On the shipyard's beach lay several unfinished large Fu ships, appearing to displace over a thousand tons—it seemed Zheng Zhilong also knew that small-tonnage ships had no place on the seas these days.

"There's not much profit in the shipyard; those ships aren't finished. But the weapons workshop has plenty of fat," a naturalized worker from the Planning Agency's Special Search Team who was accompanying him said excitedly. "It's full of pig iron, copper, and lead—especially copper, estimated at over ten thousand catties! And many iron and bronze cannons..."

He assumed this Chief was also from the Planning Agency because Chief Xu had been inspecting the supply yards and warehouses ever since coming ashore.

Xu Ke smiled slightly. His concerns were different from the Planning Agency's: not how much wealth could be seized, but whether there were any traces in the spoils that threatened the Senate's rule.

Just now at the Zhongzuo Garrison, he had seen two Lingao-manufactured 24-pounder cannons. Although their carriages were damaged, they were so distinctive that the Marines recognized them at a glance as standard Navy naval guns upon occupying the fort.

Xu Ke subsequently checked the emblems and serial numbers on the cannons, confirming that these two guns were from the missing patrol boat *Hong Kong Customs 64*. He then ordered the soldiers to collect the shells and other accessories for these two cannons. They soon found the damaged carriages, some auxiliary items for the cannons, some unfired shells, and several time fuzes for shrapnel shells.

That these two cannons had fallen into Zheng Zhilong's hands clearly indicated that *Hong Kong Customs 64* had also fallen into their hands. This wasn't unexpected to Xu Ke—after all, there were few parties with the motive and guts to do this. But Xu Ke was more concerned with exactly what purpose the Zheng group had for acquiring this ship. Was it merely to get these two cannons? Since the cannons were here, where was the typewriter (machine gun)?

Xu Ke pondered and said, "Let's go look at the shipyard first."

The shipyard itself had nothing special, using traditional Chinese shipbuilding techniques for both equipment and materials. However, Xu Ke noticed some different clues while inspecting the unfinished large Fu ships.

First, the length-to-beam ratio of these two Fu ships approached 4, while traditional Fu ships generally did not exceed 3. Such ships had good stability at the cost of slow speed. The ribs were installed using a European design, and on one nearly completed Fu ship, he saw that half of the upper deck had already been laid.

Ordinary people naturally wouldn't notice these changes, but Xu Ke was a naval intelligence officer and was very sensitive to shipbuilding technology—he had once crammed on various 16th and 17th-century navigation and naval knowledge.

These improvements indicated that the Zheng group had begun attempting to introduce some European ship manufacturing technologies. Increasing the density and strength of the ribs and laying an upper deck seemed to be preparations for installing more cannons—traditional Chinese ship types like Fu and Guang ships could not mount large numbers of cannons due to structural issues.

However, these technologies were all mature things of the time and showed no traces of borrowing from *Hong Kong Customs 64*. And the whereabouts of that missing patrol boat remained unknown.
