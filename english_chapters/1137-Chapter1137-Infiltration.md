# Chapter 1137 - Infiltration

Originally, the Dutch trading post was located on Beixianwei Island, serving both defense and guarding the Taijiang Inner Sea. However, to facilitate trade with locals, several buildings were constructed on one side of the Lu'ermen Channel to serve as a trading station. They purchased deerskins and cane sugar, and sold general merchandise, ironware, and salt.

The trading station itself was a brick building; the second and third floors were warehouses for storing purchased goods. At the entrance, Han people and natives from Xingang and other places selling deerskins and local products were lining up below the steps. A large table sat on the steps, where deerskins were laid out for inspection and pricing by a low-level Dutch clerk—deerskins were Taiwan's most valuable local export besides sugar, and the Dutch valued them highly.

The May sunlight in Taiwan was already scorching. Except for the natives who customarily went bare-headed and bare-bodied, the Han people almost all wore the bamboo conical hats common in southern Fujian, their faces barely visible. Li Siya knew that as long as her face wasn't seen, there would be no problem. She carefully observed the situation in Tayouan from under her bamboo hat.

Although it was difficult to observe the progress of Fort Zeelandia closely from this location, she could vaguely see that more than half the work was done. Li Siya estimated it would be fully completed in less than half a year.

Even more indicative of the Dutch state of alert than Fort Zeelandia was their battery on Beixianwei Island. The battery had clearly been reinforced, and bamboo walls erected on the ramparts indicated newly strengthened Dutch defenses. She noticed the number of cannons on the Beixianwei Island battery had also increased. Patrol sentries on the island had increased as well.

Recalling Guo Huaiyi's mention that the Dutch were recently recruiting large numbers of laborers for construction sites, clearly they were anxious to complete Fort Zeelandia as a strongpoint against Australian attack.

This place was very close to the Japanese village. Li Siya soon noticed a Japanese notice posted on the board at the trading post entrance. She found an excuse to walk over and glance at it, discovering it was a Dutch recruitment order.

The Dutch were recruiting Japanese as soldiers—this new discovery confirmed her deduction. She knew the East India Company's stinginess well; they would never recruit mercenaries without cause.

Governor Putmans either had extreme wariness of the Australians or harbored ill intentions toward them.

However, based on current strength in Taiwan, the Dutch were far from a match for the Australians. Hans Putmans couldn't be crazy enough to initiate hostile action against the Australians. And he didn't have the authority.

After selling the deerskins, Li Siya came to Tayouan Street—a simple market had formed outside the Dutch purchasing station due to trade. At this time, there were only a few shops and stalls doing business with local natives and trading Han people. On the street and in shops, many coming and going were natives from the local Xiaolong, Madou, and Xingang tribes. Having been "civilized" by Dutch missionaries, they wore simple clothing. However, quite a few natives were dead drunk, staggering through the streets.

The Dutch shipped large quantities of arrack from Batavia and rum from Lingao specifically to exchange for furs with the natives.

Getting natives addicted to alcohol was a common tactic of many trading companies in the Age of Discovery. Less civilized natives generally didn't need many daily necessities; to force them to trade frequently, one had to use addictive luxury goods. Once natives became addicted to alcohol, they became pitiful creatures the Company could exploit. This scene played out everywhere from North and South America to the Bering Strait and Siberia.

Li Siya had done this business herself and thought nothing of it. She had Guo Huaiyi's men take her into a decent-looking tavern. Judging by people entering and leaving, it didn't serve natives; customers were Han people, with occasional Japanese, blacks, and East Indians.

The tavern was bustling with noise, windows wide open for ventilation. It was seventy or eighty percent full. Taverns always had much news, especially small ones like this. Judging by the clientele, there were not only Han traders but also various people serving under the Dutch. From their mouths, she should be able to learn much.

Li Siya could speak many languages common on the East Asian seas—even some native dialects. At her signal, the group found a table near some drinking Japanese, ordered wine and food, and quietly ate and drank.

The Japanese spoke Japanese—probably thinking no one here understood it, so they spoke without inhibition. Li Siya quickly gathered much information: including recently strengthened defenses; orders to increase rice and gunpowder reserves in the city and various forts; and new cannons and matchlocks arriving from Batavia.

Then Li Siya heard an important piece of news: a Very Important Person would arrive at Fort Zeelandia on a trade ship coming from Batavia with the southern monsoon.

---

Although the Japanese were of relatively low status and didn't know exactly who was coming, judging from their discussion of preparations to welcome this VIP, the arrival would be at least a senior East India Company official equivalent to a Batavia Council member, or perhaps some dignitary from the Netherlands itself.

This news immediately aroused Li Siya's great interest. This VIP's sudden arrival clearly had an important purpose. If she could find out who it was and their purpose, perhaps she could exploit it.

After leaving the tavern, Li Siya immediately decided to stay the night to investigate thoroughly.

There were crude inns in the market, but naturally Li Siya couldn't stay there. Fortunately, Guo Huaiyi had people locally responsible for gathering intelligence and receiving personnel, so she stayed at their home.

"Are there prostitutes active near Tayouan Street?" she asked her attendant immediately after settling in.

"Yes, there are quite a few on the street. Han and natives..."

"Whose business do they do?"

"Anyone's."

"Do any serve Redhairs?"

"Not on the street. But over at the Beixianwei Island dock, there's a tavern with salt-water girls—Han, black. Occasionally even ghost girls. They cater specifically to sailors from ships, and Redhairs from the city often go there too."

Li Siya knew "blacks" in Han parlance included slaves from Africa as well as East Indies natives. Africans were rare in East Asia, black women even more so; more likely they were East Indies female slaves brought by the Dutch from Batavia.

"As soon as it's dark, find a way to get me onto Beixianwei Island."

"Understood!" The attendant had been instructed to obey this woman's arrangements in everything.

"When I want to return, I'll hold up a light by the shore as a signal. Send a boat to pick me up."

"Easy," the attendant said. "The boat doesn't need to return. Lu'ermen side has many reefs and shallow water. The Redhair ghosts never patrol there. I'll hide the boat among the reefs. Just whistle by the shore and I'll come out to meet you."

After complete darkness fell, Li Siya and two attendants quietly came to the shore, where a small boat was ready. Wrapped in a black hooded cloak, Li Siya leaped lightly onto the boat.

"Let's go."

The small boat quietly rowed across the water—this was the Lu'ermen Channel, impassable for large ships, thus rarely visited. The boat soon crossed safely, docking among chaotic reefs by the shore.

"Wait for me here. If I'm not back before dawn, go back quickly and report to Chief Guo." Li Siya observed the shore situation and instructed.

"Understood."

Li Siya quietly climbed ashore. It wasn't far from the dock, which was dark, with only a few lights still burning. Having ascertained the tavern's location, she groped her way toward it.

She carefully avoided sentries near the dock and took off her cloak beside a cargo pile. She wore a European-style cotton dress, deliberately torn in places, her hair let down loosely. She tore off a strip of hem, exposing part of her calves. She quickly took rouge from her pocket, smearing it on her face and lips, then used charcoal to outline her eyebrows and eyes.
