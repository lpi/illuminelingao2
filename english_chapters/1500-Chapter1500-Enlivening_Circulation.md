# Chapter 1500 - Enlivening Circulation

Liu Deshan immediately bought several hundred *dan* of Fujian sugar goods. Both sides cleared money and goods turnover. Zheng family sent several people aboard again, asking Liu Deshan and Chen Huamin about what they saw and heard regarding Australians. Liu Deshan followed Australian instructions, except not mentioning his own inspection, said quite a lot of odds and ends. Intending to exaggerate Australian strength, unavoidably embellished, speaking until faces of several Zheng family men became increasingly grave.

Zheng family manager asked about *Dongshanju*'s background again. Hearing it was bought from Hong Kong shipyard, everyone became even more disheartened. Although *Dongshanju* had no artillery equipment, ship tonnage and wide double decks all indicated this ship had great combat potential. Placed with Zheng Zhifeng here, it would also be a first-class main warship—European style large ships being imitated and started on Kinmen Island, although size tonnage much larger than *Dongshanju*, even laymen could see *Dongshanju* hull form smooth, sailing swift.

Australians actually could export such large ships as merchant ships; visible to what extent their fleet expanded! Thinking of this, several people couldn't help feeling disheartened.

Finished loading sugar goods, *Dongshanju* weighed anchor sailing—Weitou Bay now was place of right and wrong [trouble], better stay less. *Dongshanju* went all the way west, sailing toward Taiwan.

Taiwan [Dayuan] as trade port between Dutch East India Company and Lingao, immediately shook off past half-dead state after signing trade contract between both sides. Compared to Zheng Zhilong group changing orders morning and evening, constantly raising conditions, Austrian "contract spirit" was very in place, not a hair off in executing contract—of course, they also consistently demanded strictness in contract execution from others. Hans Putmans originally lacked confidence in opening Taiwan situation: in his view Chinese merchants too cunning, consistently treacherous, hard to achieve big breakthrough without using force to escort trade. Unfortunatley Chinese coastal situation so chaotic, force Company disposable in East Asia too weak.

After signing trade agreement with Australians, Taiwan situation immediately changed. Australian ships entered Taiwan port continuously, bringing countless Chinese goods Company once dreamed of—among them large quantity of increasingly best-selling Australian goods. Hans Putmans' performance steamed up daily; Company praised him greatly, naturally his personal benefits also rolled in. Especially Australians not obsessed with silver like Chinese merchants, having excellent appetite for various goods. This greatly alleviated "silver famine" situation in trade with China for Dutch East India Company. Less than half year after signing agreement, Taiwan jumped from a trade post almost to be abandoned to become a "Pearl" of Dutch East India Company.

Since Kaohsiung opened port, Australian supply cycle reduced constantly—Hans Putmans soon discovered, Australians established transit warehouse in Kaohsiung, accumulating huge amount of commodities. He once also thought if able to seize Kaohsiung through raid, not only could acquire rich spoils, but add a brilliant pearl for Company: compared to Taiwan having only one castle and several forts, Kaohsiung looked more and more like a real city.

After he witnessed Lingao fleet stationed in Kaohsiung with own eyes, this arrogant idea disappeared immediately. When news of Zheng Zhilong destruction brought back to Taiwan by Merchant Traudenius stationed in Zhangzhou Bay, he immediately began considering how to keep Taiwan for Company—of course not through force.

Although Zeelandia Castle continued construction—after all Company already invested large sum for castle, impossible to give up midway, and presiding over construction project always was thing with grease [profit]—Your Excellency Governor already completely uninterested in strengthening Taiwan defense, roughly doing whatever Company instructed him. And natives who originally posed great threat to Taiwan, frequently "grassing out," "headhunting" outside city, after experiencing several conflicts with Australians, now also rarely appeared near Taiwan. Result was land route from Taiwan to Kaohsiung also became safe; Australians even started building a road between two places without caring.

At a wine party drinking too much Australian rum, he shouted at Taiwan Garrison Commander Captain Heinrich Weidenfeller: "You think Taiwan still in Company hands relying on those four hundred tubercular ghosts holding matchlocks under you? No, we can still stay here purely because of Australian benevolence!"

Indeed, judging from interactions of both sides, Australians had no malice toward Taiwan Dutch, and could be called full of goodwill: Dutch not only could go to Kaohsiung to procure various fresh food to supplement scarce supplies—could also buy various pastimes: cigars, alcohol and drinks. If willing to pay big price, could even buy ice blocks for relieving summer heat. So much that Batavia side thought no need to transport supplies to Taiwan anymore; except gunpowder and guns, Kaohsiung "everything available to buy." Vacated cargo space could transport more trade goods to trade.

Result was Dutch increasingly relied on Kaohsiung material supply; gradually Taiwan Dutch put on undershirts, shirts and trousers sewn with imported Dutch linen made by Kaohsiung Clothing Factory, wearing Lingao manufactured rattan sandals, wearing rattan woven cool helmets. These suited Formosa climate better than Dutch original cumbersome and stuffy clothes. Dutch also drank Lingao produced rum, salt soda water and kvass in large quantities.

Not only most supplies purchased from Kaohsiung, even repairing ships went to Kaohsiung shipyard—there had large dry dock, and heavy cranes. Repairing maintaining several Dutch round ships was piece of cake.

As for Taiwan sailors and soldiers, as long as they could follow rules could also enter Kaohsiung commercial district freely for pastime entertainment. Compared to commercial district under crude Zeelandia Castle, undoubtedly Kaohsiung commercial district had more choices. If they got sick, as long as willing, could also receive Chinese doctor treatment locally. Compared to German doctors stinking all over, Kaohsiung Chinese doctors' medicine and acupuncture therapy were more effective.

Even among workers building Zeelandia Castle and forts, many were Australian slaves—Hans Putmans couldn't describe those people transported by ship loads settled in huge bamboo shed camps with other words except this word. When Dutch suffered from too few workers slow progress, Australians immediately proposed able to provide labor contracting project.

Putmans had no choice. Result proved these Chinese slave laborers under Australian management worked diligently, labor efficiency extremely high. Under their participation in construction, castle could be called changing day by day.

Hans Putmans was a shrewd capable merchant. Under this excellent situation of "Au-Dutch Harmony," he also didn't believe Australians "loved peace." Their deeds in Weitou Bay fully explained they would be merciless when needing to move hands, even could be called cruel.

Obviously, Australians not touching Taiwan, nothing more than still needing to trade with Company. If one day this trade became insignificant to them, they would come to capture Taiwan, further occupying entire Formosa Island.

How to guarantee Company survival in Formosa? Governor Hans Putmans had been considering this question recently. For this he specially dispatched a batch of spies to Kaohsiung, inquiring Australian situation, especially types, quantities of ships entering/exiting port and trade goods.

*Dongshanju* sailed into Taijiang under such atmosphere.

This wasn't first time Chen Huamin and Liu Deshan came to Taiwan, but this time still surprised them a little: Taiwan was much more prosperous than past. Because trade volume with Australians rose significantly, Dutch East India Company dispatched several times more ships here than past. Bringing Taiwan market also prospered, facilities added accordingly.

Zeelandia Castle originally always building and stopping, never completing first level terrace, had risen from ground. Scaffolds forest on brick stone walls; a tower already stood up. Several others also completed half; could see able to finish in not long. On other side of harbor, east of Taijiang, original small and crude fortress, now already became a scale not big but very solid bastion fort. North Line Tail Island in harbor also building a new fortress. Ships transporting construction materials and workers flowed endlessly in harbor.

Besides Australian trade ships, after Zheng Zhilong destruction, Fujian to Taiwan trade monopoly thoroughly broken; Great Ming merchants coming to Taiwan to trade increased quite a few. Around wharf moored many ships of different sizes; except few Dutch ships mostly were Chinese ships like Guangzhou ships, Fujian ships. Therefore on wharf before Zeelandia Castle, built many new buildings again, built rows of new warehouses and yards; goods waiting for shipment piled like mountains.

"Unimaginable Taiwan business so prosperous!" Liu Deshan nodded, "I originally thought here would be very desolate."

"What are you saying Cousin? Taiwan business was monopolized by Zheng Zhilong; how ordinary merchants dare trade here? Now Zheng family defeated utterly, folks not fools, naturally all come here to make fortune."

Compared to past Zheng family command flag two thousand taels silver a year, now Class B license issued by Australians allowing coastal trade only one hundred taels a year. Many small and medium merchants only running coast also could afford. Merchant ships going to Taiwan also increased; traded goods no longer limited to past porcelain, silk products, sugar etc. foreign cargo. Trade activity rose significantly.

Purging coastal sea lords, not merely to monopolize trade—for Senate, only promoting commercial circulation could provide better foundation for next step social reform. Although Senate could very well monopolize trade with Dutch on Taiwan Island, yet didn't do so.
