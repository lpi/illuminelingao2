# Chapter 1077 - Suppression and Appeasement

By this time, he was increasingly anxious to get reinforcements—he sent people to all places where he could ask for help to mobilize reinforcements, and at the same time issued a call for Huang Long's subordinates in Dongjiang to come to Laizhou for reinforcement. He also asked Yu Dacheng to send reinforcements quickly; he estimated that Yu Dacheng would not refuse. Although Yu Dacheng also held an "appeasement" attitude initially, the top priority right now was to hold Laizhou and block the path of the rebels fleeing, so as not to poison the whole territory of Shandong—as long as Yu Dacheng understood this, he would not refuse his request.

Yu Dacheng was already anxious like an ant on a hot pan at this moment—news had come from his memorial-reading study in the capital that the wind direction in the court was very unfavorable to him, and he might very likely be dismissed and arrested for questioning. Recently, he received a Court Letter (*Tingji*) asking him to "effectively investigate" the whereabouts of Sun Yuanhua and others.

After Dengzhou fell, Yu Dacheng lost news of Sun Yuanhua. He, who had been chanting scriptures, suddenly received Sun Yuanhua's request for help and knew that Sun Yuanhua was not only safe and sound but also guarding Laizhou. He couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief—things would be much easier to handle with Sun Yuanhua accounted for.

In the letter, Sun Yuanhua briefly described his escape experience, which inevitably contained some "artistic processing"—of course, he couldn't say he was rescued by someone—Lu Wenyuan had specifically reminded him that he absolutely could not admit that he had once been captured. Sun Yuanhua himself also understood that this was a vital joint. Fortunately, now that the person was out, he could say whatever he wanted.

As for Dengzhou Intendant Song Guanglan, Surveillance Commissioner (*Jianjun Dao*) Wang Zheng, Governor's Command Brigade Commander Zhang Tao, and others captured at the same time, Sun Yuanhua followed the suggestions of Lu Yang and others, claiming that they had broken out separately when the city broke, and their life or death was unknown.

Because Sun Yuanhua had already been rescued, whether Song Guanglan, Wang Zheng, Zhang Tao, and others would be released by Kong Youde as in history became an unknown. So for the time being, it was better to say he didn't know—if they were killed, it would be simple; if Kong Youde still released them: then according to the plan, the Special Reconnaissance Team would intercept them at the first moment and make a disposition according to the situation at that time. Among these people, Wang Zheng had seen with his own eyes that Sun Yuanhua failed to commit suicide and was captured. Others probably also heard the news of Sun Yuanhua's capture, so they must be detained to prevent leaks. The identity and status of these people were different from ordinary soldiers and civilians. Once they said that Sun Yuanhua had been captured, it would be very difficult to wash it clean again.

Beyond asking for reinforcements, the policy of suppression versus appeasement was also discussed. What surprised Yu Dacheng relatively was that Sun Yuanhua changed his attitude, from fully wanting "appeasement" to "painful suppression"—one must know that when Kong Youde besieged Dengzhou, Sun Yuanhua had specifically sent him a letter asking him to speak to Xiong Mingyu on his behalf to find a way to appease Kong Youde's troops. For this purpose, he even gave him a box of gold, silver, and jewelry worth a considerable amount for lobbying use.

Yu Dacheng had no preconceived opinion on appeasement or suppression—he had no feelings for Kong Youde and others, nor did he intend to put them to death. For him, appeasement was just a lower-cost approach. The court was now in dire straits and needed troops everywhere. It was easy to say "suppress," but where would the soldiers and horses come from? Not to mention that the local area had to raise a large amount of grain and pay.

However, Yu Dacheng decided not to care about suppression or appeasement anymore—since Sun Yuanhua was not dead, then how to deal with the rebels was his burden to bear first; he could suppress or appease as he pleased. He immediately instructed the advisor to be invited over to consider how to dispatch reinforcements and a more urgent matter—how to write a memorial to the court.

But Yu Dacheng's fate could no longer be changed. Not long after his memorial was sent out, on the thirteenth day of the first lunar month, the rebels captured Huang County. Yu Dacheng was dismissed from office and subsequently arrested and punished. However, at this time, Sun Yuanhua had already gained a firm foothold in Laizhou. His memorial had also been officially presented to the court.

Sun Yuanhua had a good perception of being an official. After the fall of Dengzhou, Kong Youde, Li Jiucheng, and others attempted to pull him into their gang to be king and raise the flag of rebellion. After being "inspired" by Lu Wenyuan and others, he had realized that "appeasement" not only could not solve this rebellion but would instead create countless enemies for him in the court—especially officials of Shandong origin. If he continued to insist on the appeasement situation, he would inevitably be attacked intensively by them who originally held a neutral attitude.

Therefore, in his letters to Xu Guangqi, Zhou Yanru, Xiong Mingyu, and other people, after briefly reporting the process of his "breakout and escape," he changed his previous attitude regarding future countermeasures and proposed "painful suppression."

Not only should troops from Zhili and other places be used, but some elite troops should also be transferred back from Liaodong to participate in the battle.

Of course, this shift to "painful suppression" was not only out of consideration for maintaining his political future but also contained the component of hatred after he had consistently trusted Kong Youde and other Dongjiang veterans but was betrayed by them.

Lu Wenyuan and others watched the situation in Laizhou at all times. Because radio equipment was limited and valuable, Lu Wenyuan established a pigeon loft soon after arriving on Qimu Island and set up a carrier pigeon communication system. Sun Yuanhua's team carried a group of carrier pigeons specifically before accompanying Sun to Laizhou. Therefore, reports were delivered to Lu Wenyuan's desk every day.

"Old Sun is still quite capable; his skill in being an official is really not bad." Lu Wenyuan looked at the team's report, and combining it with the intelligence from Leng Ningyun's side, he could clearly see the changes in the situation in Shandong.

"He started from a mere *Juren* and was recommended as an aide. In ten years, he became the Governor of Dengzhou and Laizhou. How could he do without some skill in being an official?" Lu Yang sighed. "Old Sun is a capable person. If given enough time, maybe the Manchus really would have been wiped out by his New Army."

"Your words are too naive. In the situation of the late Ming, the Great Ming court has no solution. Unless there is a strong Emperor—not Zhu Babax (Zhu Yuanzhang), but at least a strongman like Yongle."

Sun Chengzong and Xiong Tingbi actually both had opportunities. Even Yuan Chonghuan, who had mixed reputation in the Senate, could also "Recover Liao." Given the comparison of strength between Great Ming and Later Jin—as long as a somewhat capable minister wanted to complete this strategic goal, it wouldn't be too difficult.

"Their teammates were too pitiful—not to mention pig-like teammates, they dig pits for you all day long. No matter how capable you are, without a strong emperor like Yongle or Zhu Baba covering you, no one can get things done." Lu Wenyuan said, "You just look at the surrendered officials and generals of Great Ming. Before surrendering, every one of them was fatuous and afraid of death; after surrendering, every one was decisive and good at fighting..." As he spoke, he paid attention to the latest situation evolution on the map. Huang County was captured by the rebels yesterday. It was estimated that within a day or two, the area around Huang County would fall into chaos—using 21st-century parlance, a "humanitarian disaster" was happening.

"Invite Chief Zhu." Lu Wenyuan instructed the secretary.

Zhu Mingxia had basically done only one thing these days: training troops.

In addition to the Northbound Detachment conducting daily training and targeted project training, he also organized and trained the Qimu Island Village Braves, an auxiliary armed force.

The Qimu Island Village Braves were expanded from Lu Wenyuan's village brave team, supplemented by many local refugees and refugees sent by Daoist Zhang from Yizhou. Since the opening of the Qimu Island refugee camp, refugees had come like a tide. It was quite difficult to select suitable soldiers from a large group of people with dark complexions and skinny bones, but fortunately, the population base was large enough, so he still selected eight hundred men as the local auxiliary force.

The refugees selected into the Qimu Island Village Braves were all young men between eighteen and twenty-two—according to the view of the French Army before World War I, men over twenty were not good soldier material. The best cannon fodder came from the 18-20 stage. The result was that before 1914 was over, France had lost a generation.

Zhu Mingxia thought the French view was still good. At least at a low technical level, young people serving as soldiers indeed had advantages: young people had spirit, were easily agitated, lacked understanding of death, and dared to fight and risk their lives in battle.

The selected soldiers messed separately and had their nutrition specially strengthened. Young people had strong vitality; good nutritional supplementation and moderate physical exercise could quickly restore physical fitness.

The Education Administration Department gave him a designation: "Peace Preservation Corps Provisional Shandong First Advance Column." It was organized according to the establishment of the Peace Preservation Corps, with all cold weapons for equipment.

The auxiliary force was very necessary for the Northbound Detachment—the number of people in the Northbound Detachment was limited, and some had to be divided to go to Jeju Island. Within the subsequent actions, dragging out troops in multiple locations to perform containment and defense tasks was required; without expanding the army locally, the task could not be completed.

Zhu Mingxia divided the auxiliary force into two parts. One part, those who performed best in training, was incorporated into the Northbound Detachment as auxiliary soldiers, which could be directly committed to battle depending on the situation. The other part was used as the garrison of the Qimu Island base.

"How is it? Is there action?" Zhu Mingxia asked as soon as he came in—he had also received the news of Huang County being captured.

Lu Wenyuan nodded: "That's right. Since Huang County has already fallen, our recovery team is about to move out."

In the last ten days or so, because rebels were frequently active in Huang County, in order to avoid direct armed conflict, Qimu Island had not sent out organized foot recovery teams except for scouts.

After Huang County was captured, the rebels were bound to carry out large-scale burning, killing, and looting inside and outside the city. The small stockades originally within the territory of Huang County couldn't withstand such an organized army, and there would inevitably be a large number of refugees flowing towards the safe direction of Qimu Island. This time was exactly the opportunity to dispatch the recovery team.

If they didn't go out to recover them, refugees fleeing on foot in the icy and snowy first lunar month would have little chance for the old, weak, women, and children to survive. Moreover, large groups of refugees were also prone to attracting rebel attacks.

Although Lu Wenyuan decided to send out the recovery team, he still had concerns in his heart: What if they encountered rebels? If the enemy number was small, it wouldn't be a big problem; they could disperse them with superior firepower. But if it was a large group of enemies and cavalry, Zhu Mingxia's recovery team might not be able to fight the rebels while covering a large group of refugees fleeing. The mobility and organization of refugees were the worst; once chaotic, they couldn't be controlled at all. He hoped they wouldn't end up like Liu Xuande (Liu Bei) being defeated at Changbanpo.
