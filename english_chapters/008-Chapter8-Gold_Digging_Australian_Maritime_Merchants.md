Chapter 8 Gold Digging - Australian Maritime Merchants

"Damn, it's really like riding a roller coaster." Xiao Zishan said in a low voice with lingering fear.

"Wealth and honor are sought in danger." Wang Luobin still kept his hand in his pocket. Xiao Zishan knew he had been holding that electric shock device from just now until now.

"What are you saying, calm down, calm down." Sweat also appeared on President Wen's nose.

The originally passable crossing plan had problems from the start. Just as Wen Desi put the wormhole exit into his bag, he heard the dogs barking wildly. The three people were so scared that their calves went soft, and they were in a frenzy. Fortunately, Wang Luobin kept the electric shock device in his hand. Hearing the wind behind him, he hurriedly pressed the button fiercely and swept back with his hand. Like a blind cat meeting a dead mouse, he shocked a vicious dog that was about to pounce and bite until its hair stood straight, foaming at the mouth, four legs facing the sky. Probably it also numbed the subsequent ones. The pack of dogs just barked wildly and didn't come up again. Before the three could think of what to do next, the courtyard door opened, and seven or eight servants in green clothes rushed in, fully equipped with knives, spears, and sticks. There was also a musketeer with a match cord wrapped around his arm. The black muzzle pointed straight at these three plane travelers who had a head full of dreams of getting rich.

The first batch of people from a different space-time encountered in the space-time journey were obviously not very friendly. Not only unfriendly, even their lives were in danger for a moment. Having a black fowling piece pointed at themselves, such an experience was the first time in their lives for these few otaku.

Usually when they discussed ancient firearms, they were very disdainful of the fowling pieces of the Ming Dynasty, feeling that they were crudely made and their range and power were negligible. However, at this moment, with the distance between the two sides only more than twenty steps, and the black muzzle pointed at themselves, presumably even the worst fowling piece could smash their faces. They were so panicked that they didn't know what to do. The opening speech Wen Desi had thought of was scared back into his stomach.

Fortunately, seeing the fate of the dogs, the servants flinched a bit. The two sides confronted each other for a moment. Wen Desi thought that although it would not be difficult to escape if he threw a smoke grenade at this time, wouldn't the career of space-time hustlers end right here? How could they talk about the great cause of unifying the world and rebuilding China in the future! Thinking of this, heroism rose from his gall. He raised his hands high, speaking and gesturing in Cantonese, and threw over a powder box with a mirror to show that he had no malicious intent.

Unexpectedly, the effect of the powder box was so great. Before long, the three changed from being faced with knives and guns to being guests of honor.

"Old Wang, do you think it's a trap? Tricking us here to arrest us?" Xiao Zishan peeked around secretly. This was a real Ming Dynasty building. What they were sitting on was also real Ming Dynasty furniture. Any piece taken to their own time could sell for a good price, but at this moment no one was in the mood to appreciate it.

"If they wanted to make a move, they could have done it in the backyard..."

"Just be careful. By the way, don't drink the tea." Wen Desi whispered, "Look at the servants of this family, I estimate the owner is also engaged in smuggling. Such people are mostly black-hearted and cruel. Be careful if the other party has evil thoughts."

"Hmm, understood."

"Zishan, later if I throw a smoke grenade, you hurry up and help me take out the wormhole. We will flee immediately."

"Understood."

While discussing in low voices, they saw seven or eight servants surrounding a middle-aged man in luxurious clothes coming in. Xiao Zishan and the others were flustered just now, and had just calmed down a bit. At this moment, their curiosity rose greatly - this was a real person of the Great Ming! Three pairs of eyes stared straight at this fair and clean middle-aged man who maintained himself well.

Master Gao was greatly startled when he opened the box just now. He had been selling foreign goods for more than twenty years and was well-informed. Not to mention that this powder box was neither porcelain nor jade and was very rare, what was inlaid inside was a priceless crystal mirror. In these years, he had only seen it a few times. Although the size was much larger than this one, in terms of crystal clarity and brightness, they were not as good as it. He heard from Portuguese maritime merchants that this crystal mirror was only produced in one city in the West. The workshop was built on an island, heavily guarded all around, and had always been a secret manufacture. It was rare to see even in the country of the Portuguese, let alone in this Guangzhou city.

These three Japanese, what a big hand! Master Gao speculated in his heart, could they be envoys of some famous lord in Japan? On second thought, the Japanese themselves did not have enough for daily use, and ninety percent of general goods had to be transported by Tang ships. How could they have such rare treasures?

Since the other party could show goodwill with this regardless of the heavy cost, he had to meet them no matter what. Master Gao had already smelled the scent of silver. For prudence, he still took his best skilled guard servant with him.

Meeting face to face, Master Gao was stunned again. This group of people were not Japanese!

Guangzhou was a place where people from all directions mixed. He had seen many Japanese. Although these three did not grow hair, they did not have the common shaved hair of Japanese. One of them had extremely short hair, like an ascetic monk, and the other two were slightly longer. Their clothes were quite strange, buttoned-down shirts, short not reaching the knees... This outfit, Japanese didn't have, nor did Portuguese.

Moreover, the stature of these three people was tall, not short like Japanese at all. Everyone was above five feet five inches, and one of them actually had a body of six feet.

Looking at their appearance: fair skin, hands and feet not rough and large, obviously people who lived like princes usually. Observing their expressions, although somewhat anxious, there was absolutely no sense of humbleness or lowliness. There was a special confidence in their gestures.

Master Gao had been maneuvering in the business world for many years and was considered a person with sharp eyes. Looking at these three people, he couldn't make out their background.

While puzzled, seeing the three staring straight at him with extremely strange eyes, his heart felt hairy for a while. He couldn't help but take a step back, thinking could these few have the passion of Longyang? Why did they look at a man like him so creepily?

On this side, Xiao Zishan and the others saw the middle-aged man's face changing indefinitely, and also had some doubts. This man looked about fifty years old, wearing a square flat hat and a round-collared silk robe. His features were regular, with a faint wisp of beard, and his fair face was slightly fat. He formed a sharp contrast with the dark and skinny servants around him.

Master Gao arched his hands at Wen Desi and asked, "I don't know how to address the heroes?"

Because Wen Desi's windbreaker had a longer hem and the texture looked similar to silk, distinct from the coarse cloth clothes of the two short-clothed helpers, he was recognized by Master Gao as the leader.

As soon as this was said, Wen Desi immediately heard that this was not Cantonese, but had some accent of modern Nanjing dialect. So he spoke in Mandarin: "We came from overseas, couldn't distinguish the road at night, and accidentally entered your noble house. May I ask what place is this?"

Although Master Gao didn't understand very well, by intuition, these people had no malice towards him. After all, he was used to traveling in the chaotic world. He asked slowly: "Where do you heroes come from?"

Since they could communicate verbally, both sides exchanged names by speaking and writing. Wen Desi then spoke out the routine they had discussed long ago.

"Our ancestors were all people of China. After Yashan, they fled overseas. They once established a family business in Borneo. However, the king there saw that the Han people were powerful and repeatedly could not tolerate us, so we had to go to sea again and go south, until we reached Australia ten thousand miles away overseas. It has been more than two hundred years now."

Master Gao pondered for a moment and said, "So you are not Japanese?"

"We are people of Huaxia, how could we be Japanese?!" Wang Luobin interrupted dissatisfiedly.

Master Gao lifted his eyelids. These overseas people really didn't understand rules. A servant also interrupted casually.

"We are not Japanese." Wen Desi said. Seeing that this Ming Dynasty member master had no objection to this rhetoric, he became bolder. He said that Australia was originally a barbaric land with only a small number of natives. The ancestors cut through thorns and thistles there, and finally made it a happy land, living and working in peace and contentment. Ancestors of all generations missed the homeland, so they sent a few of them to carry goods and do business all the way to have a look.

Actually, there were many loopholes in these words. How they entered the city, where the ship was anchored, none were explained. But just as Wen Desi predicted: Sometimes you just need a statement and stick to it.

Master Gao nodded frequently. He knew the place Borneo. Every year several ocean ships (ocean ships in Ming Dynasty did not mean foreign ships, but ships of Ming merchants trading in the ocean) went there. He had never heard of this matter, but he was too lazy to be serious. Anyway, it was something hundreds of years ago, who could figure it out! Besides, he was not interested in either Borneo or Australia.

"...We didn't know the way and mistakenly entered your noble house, disturbing your precious place, forgive us, forgive us." Wen Desi said, performing a hand-arching salute by copying a cat to draw a tiger, "We came from overseas, may I ask what place is this?"

"Easy to say, easy to say," Master Gao said. These few people carried heavy treasures and could enter the city late at night, extremely not simple. Just listen to this rhetoric tentatively, "This is Nanhai County, Guangzhou Prefecture, Great Ming."

Wen Desi immediately followed up with a question: "I don't know what year, month and day is today?"

Master Gao was startled and answered: "February of the seventh year of Tianqi."
