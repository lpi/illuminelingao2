Chapter 32 Oriole Society

"The mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind."

The Transmigrators thought they were doing things secretly, but they didn't know that they had already been targeted by a mysterious organization.

This organization was called the "Oriole Society".

The Oriole Society was a secret intelligence organization in the Jiangnan area of the Ming Dynasty. Its members were all over the government and the public, covering officials, merchants, scholars, monks and Taoists...

Their aim was "to control the world's affairs and seek the world's profit". They collected intelligence, manipulated the situation, and sought benefits from it.

The actions of the Transmigrators in Guangzhou naturally could not escape the eyes and ears of the Oriole Society.

"Who are these people? Where do they come from? What do they want to do?"

In a secluded garden in Suzhou, the leader of the Oriole Society, "Mr. Oriole", was listening to the report of his subordinates.

"According to the investigation, they claim to be merchants from Australia." A subordinate in black reported, "They sell strange goods, have huge wealth, and their behavior is secretive."

"Australia?" Mr. Oriole frowned, "Never heard of it. Is it a barbarian land?"

"It doesn't look like it." The subordinate shook his head, "They speak Mandarin, know etiquette, and seem to be very familiar with court affairs."

"Oh?" Mr. Oriole became interested, "This is interesting. Continue to investigate. I want to know their true background."

"Yes."

The spies of the Oriole Society began to infiltrate the surroundings of the Transmigrators.

Some disguised as beggars and squatted near the stronghold of the Transmigrators.
Some pretended to be merchants and tried to do business with the Transmigrators.
Some even tried to bribe the servants of the Transmigrators.

However, they soon found that these "Australians" were not simple.

Their vigilance was very high, and their internal management was strict. It was difficult for outsiders to penetrate.

Especially that Zhao Manxiong, he seemed to have eyes on his back, able to see through the disguise of spies at a glance.

Several spies of the Oriole Society were caught by Zhao Manxiong just as they made a move.

"Say, who sent you?" In the gloomy interrogation room, Zhao Manxiong played with a scalpel in his hand and asked coldly.

The spy gritted his teeth and said nothing.

"Stubborn." Zhao Manxiong sneered, "I have plenty of ways to make you speak."

After a while, screams came from the interrogation room.

Through interrogation, the Transmigrators learned of the existence of the Oriole Society.

"Oriole Society?" Wen Desi frowned, "What kind of organization is this?"

"A troublesome organization." Lin Baiguang said, "They are ubiquitous and pervasive. Being targeted by them is not a good thing."

"Then what should we do? Eliminate them?" Xi Yazhou asked murderously.

"No." Wen Desi shook his head, "We don't know their details yet. Acting rashly will only alert the enemy."

"We can use them." Zhao Manxiong suddenly said.

"Use them?"

"Yes." Zhao Manxiong pushed his sunglasses, "Since they want intelligence, we'll give them intelligence. True and false, let them be confused."

"We can also use their network to spread some news beneficial to us."

"This is called 'borrowing a boat to go to sea'."

Everyone's eyes lit up. This was a good idea!

So, a contest between intelligence and counter-intelligence began quietly.

The Transmigrators deliberately released some false news, leading the Oriole Society by the nose.
At the same time, they also used the channel of the Oriole Society to spread the "magical deeds" of the Australians, creating public opinion for themselves.

Under the manipulation of the Transmigrators, the Oriole Society not only failed to find out their details, but became their free microphone.

Mr. Oriole sat in the garden in Suzhou, looking at the intelligence in his hand, falling into deep thought.

"These Australians... are unfathomable!"

He realized that he had encountered a powerful opponent.
