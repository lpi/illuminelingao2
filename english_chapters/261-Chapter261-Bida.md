# Chapter 261 Bida

That evening, the group pulled Li Benqing and his nephew over for dinner. Wang Aoya had sent a large amount of food and rice wine, which served perfectly for treating guests. Xiong Buyou probed for information about the situation within the stockade.

It turned out that after the previous chief of the Zhen Dui Stockade passed away, his son was still too young to rule, so the four *Oyas* of the stockade assisted in governance. All matters, big or small, were decided collectively by the *Oyas*. The leader was surnamed Wang—the eldest one who had come to invite them. Wang Aoya was also the chief's uncle, making them family. As for the young man who had been quite active outside the shed earlier, he was the son of another *Oya* named Zhen Huan. He was an excellent hunter and held significant prestige among the stockade's youth.

Gotten somewhat tipsy from the upland rice wine, Li Benqing revealed that the woman identified as the "Curse Mother" was none other than Zhen Huan's lover from the *Gui Long*, named Bida. During the ritual, Zhen Huan had turned hostile on the spot and nearly slaughtered the *Daogong*, but was suppressed by the united front of the other *Oyas*.

"Zhen Oya's days haven't been easy," Li Benqing said. "Everyone says his son instructed Bida to place a *Jin* on the Chief."

"Why?"

"The earliest chiefs of Zhen New Stockade were from the Zhen family." Li Benqing drank more rice wine. "The Zhen family has established the stockade here for ten generations—"

"That long?" Fang Jinghan was somewhat skeptical.

"Don't interrupt, let Li Baya finish," Mu Min said.

Li Benqing, hearing Mu Min address him as "Baya," beamed with smiles. This was a respectful term of endearment used by the Li people for their elders.

"About four or five generations ago, maybe?" Li Benqing wasn't clear on the specific years. "Wang Chief's ancestors moved their entire family to this stockade. Their family was originally Han; the genealogy says they came from very far north on the mainland and were some kind of Han general. At that time, our stockade was at war with the nearby Shuishen Stockade. The Zhen family suffered many casualties. The Wang family disciples all knew martial arts, and they led everyone to wipe out the Shuishen Stockade in one go. From then on, the Wang family became the chiefs."

"So the Wang family is actually Han?" Xiong Buyou asked. "But why would a general move his whole family to live in a Li stockade?"

Fang Jinghan, while taking notes, remarked, "As for 'general,' it's probably them raising their own status, right? It's not impossible that they were just fugitive military households from the local area."

Li Benqing continued: simple since then, two major factions formed in the stockade. One was the Wang family, and the other was the Zhen family. Although the Zhen family no longer held the position of chief, they were deeply rooted and influential in the stockade, so at least one of the four *Oyas* was always from their family.

Now, with the Wang family's chief being young and the Zhen family producing a charismatic descendant like Zhen Huan, the balance of power was clearly tipping towards the Zhen family.

"Zhen Huan not only has prestige among the youth but is also hugely popular in the *Gui Long*." Li Benqing rarely drank, but now that he had let loose, his nose had turned red. "At night, he just stands in front of any *Gui Long*, and the door opens. No need to talk, no need to sing. Tsk tsk. But Bida is his favorite."

"Sounds like a mountain stronghold version of a palace intrigue?" Mu Min said. "Could Zhen Oya's son be trying to seize the opportunity to rise to power? Is that why he obstructed us from treating the Chief? By the way—" she became excited, "maybe he was the one who put that bamboo splinter there!"

"You've read too many novels," Cui Yunhong disagreed. "Even if it's true, it's none of our business."

"Sigh." Mu Min sighed regretfully. In just those few minutes, her mind had already completed an outline for a palace intrigue novel that could totally be published on Jinjiang.[^1]

Over the next two days and nights, the young chief's high fever persisted. He Ping took his temperature every two hours, administered sulfonamides every six hours, and changed the dressing. By the morning of the third day, the boy's temperature dropped to a normal level. His consciousness cleared significantly, and he began to feel hungry. When He Ping changed the dressing, he found no new traces of pus or blood on the drainage strip—the wound could be bandaged up.

Now everyone knew the Chief was cured. Just as the exploration team was rejoicing that this matter had a good beginning and end, various illnesses sprang up like bamboo shoots after rain throughout the stockade. Fever, toothache, stomach ache, infected wounds—everything was represented. He Ping was, after all, only a half-trained health worker; faced with such a rich internship opportunity, he was immediately flustered. His medical kit didn't have many drugs available either.

He had no choice but to treat the diseases that were easy to cure and diagnose one by one. He performed seven or eight minor surgeries in a row; now He Ping wielded the scalpel with incomparable grace, even daring to operate on styes he previously felt helpless against. However, he was very careful not to give antibiotics indiscriminately, fearing he might mess up the local microbial environment. As for illnesses with difficult-to-judge causes like stomach aches, He Ping simply used rice flour mixed with honey provided by the stockade to make some pills and distributed them. Surprisingly, quite a few people claimed they were cured after eating them—the power of placebos was indeed strong.

Thus, the Shilu Iron Mine Exploration Team became "divine doctors." Everyday, items sent by various households in the Li stockade arrived endlessly. When everyone discovered that these "divine doctors" didn't eat much pork or beef but seemed to love chicken, not a single live chicken was left in the entire stockade. Cui Yunhong looked on in distress at the pile of gifts in the yard in front of Li Benqing's house: wild game, live chickens, rice wine, leather, kapok cloth, kudzu cloth, and various rattan wares... A dazzling array, clearly the best produce from the vicinity brought out. Cui Yunhong suddenly noticed people were constantly bringing cows and tying them in front of the door.

"What is this for?" Cui Yunhong asked Assistant Wang.

"This is payment for your medical services," Assistant Wang was also very happy to see these boat peddlers being so capable. A rising tide lifts all boats; in the past few days, he had privately accepted many invitations to eat, having wine and meat at every meal. "Li people don't have money; only mountain goods and cattle."

"This—" Cui Yunhong thought Wu Nanhai would certainly like local cattle, but the problem was how to drive them back to Changhua Fort? That was a technical job.

While he was hesitating, the *Oyas* sent someone to invite them to a banquet.

At the banquet, all four *Oyas* were present, taking turns to propose toasts to the exploration team members. The young chief, weak from his illness, couldn't eat or drink much and just sat at the head of the table accompanied by his mother, looking curiously at this group of strange merchants.

After several rounds of rice wine, Wang Aoya, the leader of the four, clapped his hands lightly. Immediately, someone brought out a tray. Cui Yunhong looked and saw it was filled with white and green bits—broken silver and copper coins of various sizes. It looked like a lot, but in reality, it was only about ten taels of silver and a thousand copper coins. The Li people did not place much importance on wealth and currency; trade was done by barter, and they did not hoard gold and silver. Being able to bring this out meant they had practically turned the stockade upside down.

"These are meager items," Wang Aoya said. "Additionally, we gift fifty head of cattle as a token of gratitude."

The Li people loved raising cattle, and the number of cattle was large. Li transactions often used cattle as payment.

This number startled them. Leaving aside other things, how could they drive so many cows back to Changhua Fort? Besides, Changhua Fort itself couldn't raise cattle; they would all have to be transported back to Lingao and handed over to the Agricultural Committee. The thought of feeding cattle and cleaning up cow dung for the next few weeks made everyone unanimously stare at the team leaders, demanding they refuse immediately.

Mu Min said to Cui Yunhong, "We can't accept this gift. So many cows are probably half the stockade's herd. If they give them all to us, how will they farm?"

Cui Yunhong wasn't thinking that nobly; he was afraid of becoming a cowboy. Although their starting points were different, their viewpoints were consistent, so he firmly declined, stating: they helped treat the Chief and the Li people only out of charity and could not accept such a heavy gift.

Seeing their sincere words, completely unlike the usual money-grubbing look of peddlers, the *Oyas* felt a few more degrees of respect in their hearts.

"You have shown such great kindness to my Li stockade, yet you refuse to accept gifts," Wang Aoya felt troubled. "How can we thank you?"

Mu Min felt the opportunity had come. The young girl accused of being a "Curse Mother" was still locked up in the stockade. Once the Chief fully recovered, she would be killed. So she proposed whether they could spare Bida. If they feared she would harm people, the team was willing to take her away from the stockade and never let her return.

Li Benqing, acting as the translator, looked troubled but reluctantly translated their meaning. This request made the sitting headmen look difficult. In their hearts, clearing a dangerous "Curse Mother" like Bida from their sight was naturally a good thing, but letting Han people take away a woman of their own tribe was unjustifiable in terms of face. Yet, these people had shown great kindness to the stockade; refusing seemed inhospitable.

After a long while, Wang Aoya said, "Bida is a 'Curse Mother.' If you take her and she brings the 'Curse' to you, how can we bear the responsibility? It is better to end it right here."

Mu Min requested again and again, but Wang Aoya just wouldn't agree. Suddenly, Zhen Oya spoke up: "She is a scourge. Even if we kill her here, she will harm people as a ghost. The *Bahas* have high magical power; if they take her, they might be able to suppress her."

The Chief, who had been silent, also nodded and said, "Let the *Bahas* take her. After all, the *Daogong* in the stockade can't suppress her either."

Wang Aoya looked displeased, but out of deference to the Chief's will, he didn't flare up. So the matter was settled. Wang Aoya insisted again on giving them gifts. After some polite declining, Cui Yunhong felt that refusing again would be too rude, and besides, the Agricultural Committee did need cattle. So he agreed to accept ten head. Wang Aoya was overjoyed and immediately ordered people to prepare ten robust cattle.

Cui Yunhong then remembered the soap bean forest outside the stockade and proposed to take back a few hundred catties.

"Good!" Zhen Oya didn't know why they were interested in those beans, but since they wanted them, he agreed readily and arranged for people to pick them. Both sides carved wood as a contract: the Transmigrators would come to the Li stockade at least once a year to treat illnesses, and whenever the Transmigrators came to the Li district for business, they could rest and stay in the stockade with this wooden tally. Meals and firewood would all be supplied by the Li stockade, and in case of need, they could also requisition porters and cattle to transport goods.

That night, guests and hosts enjoyed themselves thoroughly. Early the next morning, the exploration team set off back to Changhua Fort. having lived together with Li Benqing day and night for ten days, there was naturally a reluctant parting sentiment. Assistant Wang was very happy; bringing this group to the Li district this time, he not only received rare white sugar as payment but also got many gifts from the local Li people. He had made a small fortune.

The ten cows were all laden with baskets of soap beans and other local produce. Because there were simply too many gifts, Cui Yunhong could only take one or two useful items from each family's offering and returned the rest. This action touched the entire stockade deeply, earning them a reputation for benevolence and righteousness.

Assistant Wang drove the cattle in front, and the exploration team followed out of the stockade gate. The *Oyas* and many Li people lined the path at the gate to see them off, the atmosphere warm. Xiong Buyou said, "Now I know what it feels like to be the Eighth Route Army—"

Mu Min sighed with emotion, "This is the hearts of the people."

After walking three or four *li*, near a forest, Zhen Oya and a few Li men were waiting for them. A woman was tied to a tree with a rope, her hands bound.

"This is Bida," Zhen Oya ordered the rope untied and handed it to Mu Min. "She is yours. Take her as far away as possible. Never bring her back. It's best to change her name too."

"Understood, we will treat her well." Mu Min looked solemn.

A trace of gratitude appeared on Zhen Oya's consistently indifferent face: "Bida is a pitiful child. You are good people; take care of her."

After Zhen Oya finished speaking, he turned and left with his men directly. Everyone felt a sense of loss. Xiong Buyou spoke up:

"Why do I feel that this Zhen Oya doesn't really believe she's a 'Curse Mother'?"

"There are probably some hidden circumstances. We don't care about that. Just saving a life," Cui Yunhong said. "Let's go."

Mu Min walked up to the woman. Likely due to her imprisonment, the woman's hair was messy. She wore a low-collared short shirt on her upper body and a blue tube skirt embroidered with white flowers below. Her clothes were stained with dirt and torn in a few places, looking quite bedraggled.

She looked at this group of people in terror, shrinking back. Only then did everyone see that her face was not heavily tattooed like other Li women; there were only some fine, faint patterns along the edges of her forehead and cheeks. With curved eyebrows, looking about sixteen or seventeen years old, she had delicate features. Seeing such a young woman's face after seeing so many heavy tattoos gave everyone a feeling of brightness.

Mu Min was surprised and asked Assistant Wang, "Her face tattoos are very light?"

"This counts as tattooed," Assistant Wang said. Indeed, some women were unwilling to tattoo their faces and only did some symbolic tattoos—after all, the love of beauty is universal.

The group took this unexpected harvest and embarked on the return journey. Mu Min wanted to untie the rope binding her hands, but Cui Yunhong said they had promised to take the girl away. If they untied her and she ran back to the Li stockade, it would harm her and make them look untrustworthy.

Bida was very obedient; walking when told to walk, resting when told to rest. But no matter who asked her questions, she remained completely silent. Mu Min thought that at such a young age, being accused of a fabricated crime and following a group of strange foreigners to an unknown destination, the pain in her heart could be imagined. It was better not to say or ask too much.

After walking more than ten *li*, they suddenly heard a "swish" in the air, followed by a sharp whistling sound.

***
Note: The following explanation is outside the 4000-word count and is not charged.

Bida is a type of Li musical instrument. Using it as a woman's name is probably suitable. This instrument is actually a modern product; whether it existed in the Ming Dynasty is unknown. It looks similar to panpipes.
