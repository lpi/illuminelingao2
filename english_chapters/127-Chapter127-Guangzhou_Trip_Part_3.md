# Chapter 127: Guangzhou Trip (Part 3)

Xiao Zishan ordered Sun Chang to prepare mule carts and sedan chairs to fetch people from the dock. Others quickly cooked and cleaned. The empty mansion suddenly bustled. Sun Chang said mules and carts required no trouble—just contact Qiwei Escort Bureau. Escort bureaus, due to convoy needs, typically ran mule and horse cart services as side businesses. Everything was ready-made.

While arranging transportation, he also ordered sedan chairs to visit Gao Ju. En route, he asked Sun Chang about developments this past year. Sun Chang said since their departure, Gao Ju often sent people with gifts—asking about Australian merchant news. The neighborhood was peaceful—except for Liu Laoxiang's Pearl River estuary disturbances causing slight market jitters. Nothing major. He knew little about official circles—only that some palace bigwig in Beijing had fallen; Guangzhou's officialdom had some changes. Details were unclear.

Xiao Zishan knew this "palace bigwig" was Wei Zhongxian. History in this timespace hadn't altered its trajectory: the all-powerful "Nine Thousand Years" had committed suicide last year on November sixth (lunar) at an inn in Fucheng County, Hebei. From last December through this year's first half, the Chongzhen Emperor was vigorously pursuing Wei faction remnants. Official shakeups were unsurprising. Travellers should thank this situation: with everyone panicking, no one had attention for some pirate incursion on Hainan.

Xiao Zishan's sudden visit brought Gao Ju both surprise and joy. Regarding the Wei Zhongxian shrine construction matter—having no good options—he'd used the strategy Manager Wen had taught: "stall." That manager had clearly said "within the month, major changes." Indeed: Eunuch Yang had been stationed in Guangzhou, demanding daily progress. Gao Ju dared not delay too much—just prepared leisurely, dragged about twenty days. Then Little Eunuch Yang suddenly came to bid farewell—ordering shrine construction halted—hurriedly departing for Beijing with prepared Australian goods. Gao Ju was flabbergasted. Another ten days later, he received Beijing correspondence—only then learning: on May eighteenth, the Emperor had suddenly fallen seriously ill. This made Gao Ju not just amazed but literally chilled—goosebumps rising.

"May eighteenth, changes in Beijing. Matters can be delayed." These were Manager Wen's parting words. Comparing now—this already mysterious group of sea merchants seemed even more unfathomable. He urgently sent people to inquire: had anyone seen strange foreign mega-ships? No news. He resigned himself to waiting—they'd surely come find him; after all, 200,000 *liang* in payment remained here. Waiting over a year, still no word. Just when hope faded, this past month, he'd heard rumors: near Qiongzhou, an unprecedented giant ship had appeared. Crew all short-haired, short-clothed—extremely fierce. He secretly wondered: could this be the Australian merchants' ship? He was considering whether to send investigators.

Gao Ju ordered welcome banquet preparations while making pleasantries. He produced sales ledgers—currently 50,000 *liang* available; remaining amounts could be gathered in ten-plus days.

"Silver's not urgent—it can stay with Manager Gao for now." Transmigrators currently lacked silver less than materials. Xiao Zishan wasted no time—telling him this trip was for procurement. Given the diverse merchandise, he'd need Manager Gao's assistance. Gao Ju assumed the usual porcelain, spices, hardwoods—readily agreed. But opening the list, he was stunned. The items were completely unexpected: pig iron, graphite, fluorite, chalcanthite, alum, copperas, saltpeter, Glauber's salt, soda ash, sulfur, arsenic, realgar, orpiment, cinnabar, borite, gypite, tin, lead, copper, mercury...

Most of these Gao Ju didn't even recognize. Some he knew from workshop use; others were simply medicinals. Saltpeter and sulfur were government controlled. Pig iron—10,000 *shi* right off—was manageable; just required visiting more forges. But mercury—ten *shi*?! All Guangzhou's mercury combined might not make one *shi*. What did they want this for? Had some Australian emperor died, needing mercury for embalming?

Lost in speculation, Xiao Zishan noticed his shifting expressions: "Any difficulties?"

"All findable." Gao Ju set down the list. "Just—aren't these quantities excessive? Take chalcanthite, mercury—the entire city might have one *shi*. Where would this much come from?"

"Then please trouble Elder Brother Gao. Whatever amount available." Xiao Zishan didn't know what these were for—but specifically ordered items were surely essential.

"Little Brother entrusts Elder Brother—naturally I'll do my utmost." Gao Ju suddenly changed address, lowering his voice: "However, several are contraband. Elder Brother isn't incapable—but everything needs reasons, for proper handling."

Xiao Zishan was startled—he'd only known saltpeter and sulfur were possibly controlled. Others he hadn't considered: "Which are contraband?"

"Iron is export-prohibited. But that's manageable. Copper, arsenic, saltpeter, sulfur are the trouble—especially given the quantities you want—"

"These are raw materials for Australian goods." Xiao Zishan had learned from Sun Chang: Gao Ju had made a fortune on Australian goods—becoming Guangzhou's "wealth legend." Using "Australian goods raw materials" as an excuse, he'd exert full effort. Also true: Industrial Department urgently needed these for modern manufacturing.

Indeed, Gao Ju fell silent—seemingly weighing something. After a moment, as if resolved: "Since Little Brother wants them, Elder Brother will definitely help. Just—gathering takes time. How long can Little Brother wait?"

"Fifteen days."

"Somewhat tight. I'll have my managers split up to procure. Will arrange as best as possible! Where should goods be delivered? Still the same—"

"This requires Elder Brother's advice." Xiao Zishan's other objective was establishing Guangzhou–Hainan transport lines. Future large-scale Guangzhou procurement needed suitable transshipment points. Too many eyes in the city—bulk goods moving in and out was inconvenient. An external warehouse was needed.

He explained requirements to Gao Ju. Gao Ju said this was easy—he had his own warehouse dock on Youyu Islet in the Pearl River estuary. That was smuggler-fishermen's territory—half civilian, half bandit types. Urban officials dared not enter—practically a lawless zone. Travellers' ship could dock there. He'd allocate a separate warehouse for goods transshipment.

"That works well." Xiao Zishan was satisfied with this arrangement. He added: their purchasing was long-term—whatever amounts available, they'd buy all.

After settling matters, Gao Ju asked if they'd brought new Australian goods. Xiao Zishan just smiled faintly: "Those are just small trinkets. Give it a few months—Elder Brother will see."

This gave Gao Ju boundless imagination—but also some fear. Personally, he didn't fear this short-hair before him. But the shadowy, powerful force behind him made him uneasy. These Australian merchants were definitely not just merchants.

Xiao Zishan's next visit was Qiwei Escort Bureau's Manager Sun Kecheng. Escort bureaus had long-distance bulk transport capabilities—excellent partners for establishing overland transport lines.

En route, Sun Wei had already briefed him on the bureau's details. This was a family, clan, fellow-townsman, and martial-brotherhood network. From Chief Escort Sun Kecheng down to counter clerks and stable hands—all were relatives, townsmen, or martial brothers. They exclusively ran Guangzhou to Nanchang routes, plus provincial short hauls. Multiple branch offices along the way. Middle-sized by Guangdong standards—with connections everywhere. Xiao Zishan calculated: gaining control of this bureau would greatly benefit Guangdong trade and intelligence operations.

Chief Escort Sun was pleased by his visit—these Australian merchants truly valued relationships. Xiao Zishan presented gifts; conversation was pleasant. He then inquired about bureau business.

Sun Kecheng sighed repeatedly—expression darkening.

Escort work itself wasn't bad. But routes grew increasingly unsafe. Past bandits were at least "men of the trade"—following underworld rules. These past two years, roving bandits and marauders dominated—desperate peasants or unpaid deserting soldiers. Neither respected names or rules—seeing goods, they robbed; seeing people, they killed. Past bandits only wanted valuables. Current marauders took everything—goods, carts, all.

With bandits rampant, villages and towns everywhere built militias and established strongholds. Passing through meant constant questioning and wariness. Outsider bureaus like theirs—if not for most brothers being Jiangxi natives with local connections—couldn't even find food and lodging. Several forced convoys succeeded without losing cargo—but ten-plus brothers died or were wounded. Bureau staff felt their future uncertain.

When Xiao Zishan proposed investing as shareholders while opening new routes, Sun Kecheng's jaw dropped. Since escort businesses began, bureaus weren't money-making ventures. Brothers pooling resources was enough to open shop. Earnings came from physical labor and risking lives. Year-round, everyone maybe achieved modest comfort—significant dividends didn't exist. Nobody had ever invested money in bureaus.

"No dividends needed." Xiao Zishan then explained: "We're establishing businesses across the Ming. Shop operations and shipping inevitably arise. For land and water transport—nobody knows it better than you. This investment: first, we don't take bureau dividends; second, we don't interfere with internal affairs. Just—wherever our businesses expand, your routes follow!"
