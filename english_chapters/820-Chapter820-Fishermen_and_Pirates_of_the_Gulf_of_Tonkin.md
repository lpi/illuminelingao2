# Chapter 820 - Fishermen and Pirates of the Gulf of Tonkin

Soon, Bei Kai saw what was happening on the sea: a large trawl fishing boat was fleeing. Several ships were chasing it furiously, occasionally firing flaming rockets, shouting wildly, and beating gongs and drums. The fishing boat's sails were partly burned, one mast had fallen, and someone was sculling desperately.

"Robbing a fishing boat," Zhang Dabala said. "No worries! Just local half-fishermen half-bandits! They don't even have cannons. Won't hinder us."

Yan Maoda also came up to the poop deck to watch the show—he held a telescope. The fleeing ship had seemingly spotted them and turned to rush toward them, suddenly raising a flag on its mast.

Before Zhang Dabala could speak, Yan Maoda shouted:

"Bei Kai! Check if that fishing boat is flying a Lingao flag?!"

Bei Kai grabbed the telescope. Indeed, a triangular fishery flag rose on the trawler's mast—the navigation flag issued by the Navy to fishing boats registered in Lingao. Previously valid only around Lingao, it now extended to the whole Qiongzhou Strait. Fishing boats without this flag were targets for Coast Guard expulsion or capture.

"That's right!" Bei Kai got nervous. "They definitely saw the Lingao naval flag on our mast..."

Since Lingao hadn't designed a merchant flag yet, Dabo Shipping Company vessels also flew the Navy flag.

"Perfect timing!" Zhang Dabala, a former pirate, was naturally tempted by fighting scenes. Now possessing such a fine ship—"carrying a sharp weapon breeds killing intent"—he was eager to try.

But remembering his mission was to escort the Chiefs to Hongji, he looked at Yan Maoda.

"Chief, look—"

"Save them, of course!" Yan Maoda said righteously. "That ship paid taxes to us; it deserves protection."

"You got it!" Zhang Dabala rubbed his hands together. He didn't understand the principles, but he knew he had the green light to fight. He shouted loudly, "All hands prepare for battle!"

Marines stood ready with loaded guns, occupying high points on the gunwales and poop deck, watching the fishing boat fleeing toward them. Although they decided to rescue, the possibility of a trap wasn't ruled out. Pirates in the South China Sea often feigned distress to lure larger, faster ships into lowering their guard, launching surprise attacks when alongside.

The fishing boat didn't close directly but fled toward *Zhennan*'s rear quarter. Zhang Dabala roared "Left rudder 15," and *Zhennan* slowly turned, bringing its broadside to bear on the pursuers.

The chasing small boats saw a Cheng Yaojin rush out halfway [an unexpected disruptor]—a large ship suddenly blocking them from their prey. Their speed dropped immediately. It seemed the pirates hadn't expected a large ship to intervene. After a few minutes' hesitation, the small boats scattered, seeming ready to attack the large ship from multiple directions.

"Open fire!" At Zhang Dabala's command, the typewriter erupted with tremendous noise, filling the poop deck with smoke. Tongues of fire spat from the square directional frame, the typewriter's piercing roar drowning out everything. Wood chips mixed with flesh flew everywhere on the pirate ship.

"Change drum!" the gunner shouted. A scorching drum was pulled off and dropped into a sand-filled basket. Two sailors quickly lifted a second drum onto the mount, helping the gunner lock it—this behemoth wasn't light.

The typewriter on its gimbal mount swung around, pouring bullets onto a second pirate ship. In this first combat experience, the gunner controlled the rhythm poorly, emptying all bullets into one ship before stopping. Only after 8 drums were emptied did silence return. The heated barrel smoked with wisps of white smoke.

Four pirate boats that had been chasing the trawler lay paralyzed on the sea, silent. Zhang Dabala scrutinized the quiet pirate ships, and the sailors beside him peered out—it was their first time using a typewriter in combat; who knew what the situation was over there? Should they continue attacking?

Zhang Dabala looked at Yan Maoda. Yan Maoda observed the opposing ships with his telescope and ordered: "Organize a boarding party! The enemy is finished."

Seeing the large ship approach, people on the small boats began jumping into the sea.

"Don't let a single one escape!" Yan Maoda ordered.

The marines immediately began a target shooting competition, firing at the swimmers in the water, killing them one by one until no heads remained on the surface.

*Zhennan* carefully approached one pirate ship. These boats were small, the largest only 50-60 tons. From above, the deck was a mess of gore. Torsos, limbs, and shredded flesh were everywhere. The boarding party jumped onto the enemy ship, searched around, and found only a few terrified captives below deck. Two smaller sampans had no living souls left. Finally, they rounded up 5 captives, all collapsed on deck shivering. They wore the black trousers and jackets common to fishermen in this region, ragged and sun-darkened—nothing remarkable.

Zhang Dabala ordered sailors to throw the corpses overboard and wash the blood-soaked deck. One sampan, heavily damaged by strafing, was simply scuttled. Apart from the boats, there was no loot worth mentioning, just a dozen baskets of fish and shrimp. Weapons were mainly inferior cold steel; not even the matchlocks common in Southeast Asia were found. This confirmed Zhang Dabala's claim: these were likely amateur pirates, half-fishermen half-bandits. Perhaps they had just engaged in robbery on a whim.

"What about the captives?"

"Keep them. Wash them thoroughly and lock them below deck." Yan Maoda thought they could serve as the first batch of miners.

As they spoke, the trawl fishing boat approached.

"Where are you from? What happened?" Zhang Dabala leaned out and shouted.

"Chief—" The person on the trawler opened with a term that clearly showed they had been to Lingao.

"I'm not a Chief, call me Old Zhang!"

"This lowly one is a fisherman from Haikang! Came here to fish! Didn't expect to meet these pirates," the man shouted. "Manager Zhang's great kindness..."

"Cut the crap!" Zhang Dabala wasn't interested. "If you weren't flying the Lingao flag, I wouldn't have bothered saving you!"

"Yes, yes..."

Zhang Dabala waved his hand: "Show your plaque!" Boat owners applying for fishing permits in Lingao received, besides a flag, a special hardwood plaque with a specific serial number and anti-counterfeiting pattern for inspection.

The plaque was passed up—Yan Maoda glanced at it. Correct. This plaque was specially processed by the wood processing factory; the branded anti-counterfeiting mark and digital font weren't something native craftsmen could easily forge. He instructed Zhang Dabala to copy the number. Upon returning to Lingao, a report would be filed with the Coast Guard.

"Let them go. Don't they know to sail in groups when fishing here?" Yan Maoda said. "Security around here is terrible!"

"Master, they got separated this time," Zhang Dabala laughed. " If they were in a large group, who knows who'd be robbing whom."

"True." Yan Maoda nodded. Everything on this South China Sea was chaotic. "But since they paid taxes and flew our flag, we should stand up for them. Can't just take money and ignore their lives."

"The Chief is right," Zhang Dabala nodded. In his view, having power meant collecting money was right. As for whether collecting money meant protecting safety, he hadn't thought about it—he had no concept of "serving the taxpayer." Zhang Dabala couldn't quite understand the Chiefs' mindset, knowing only one thing: the Chiefs were smarter than him. He felt knowing that was enough.

From this incident, Yan Maoda had a new idea. Since fishermen from Hainan and Western Guangdong fished not only in the Qiongzhou Strait but also frequently in the Gulf of Tonkin—this revenue source shouldn't be abandoned. In the 21st century, the Gulf of Tonkin was a prime fishing ground. Fisheries were currently the Transmigration Group's main protein source. Besides the Navy's own fishing fleet, the "One-in-Five" fishery tax collected from fishermen was a major source of catch.

Current collection of the "One-in-Five" tax was limited to the Qiongzhou Strait. If they expanded the collection system to the entire Gulf of Tonkin, the revenue from fisheries would increase tenfold or a hundredfold. They could also organize fishery cooperatives, organizing Lingao fishing boats to fish in the Gulf of Tonkin in fleets. Not only would this create economies of scale, but the Navy could also organize escorts—or even without escorts, teaching them some old-timeline fishermen's tactics would beat the monkeys until they bled from seven orifices. There were no large pirate groups in the Gulf of Tonkin; it was basically a vacuum. It would be relatively easy for the Navy to extend its reach—if necessary, organized fishermen could serve as an auxiliary force. For the Transmigration Regime in dire need of Vietnamese rice, timber, and coal, controlling the sea in the Gulf of Tonkin was imperative.

Yan Maoda was lost in thought—he had to propose this to the Executive Committee upon return.

"Chief—" Zhang Dabala saw he was zoning out and prompted him.

"Hmm? What is it?"

"What about those boats?" After the pirates were eliminated, two serviceable sampans and a fishing boat remained.

"Take them. We'll need boats when we get to Hongji." Having boats and men delivered to their door before even landing counted as an auspicious start.

Zhang Dabala immediately ordered sailors to man the fishing boat and tow the sampans behind the big ship.
