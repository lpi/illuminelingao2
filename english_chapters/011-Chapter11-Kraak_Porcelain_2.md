Chapter 11 Kraak Porcelain (2)

After returning to the guest house of the municipal party committee - which was a hotel in the 1980s, the three people carefully unpacked the newly bought porcelain. In order to avoid damage, Master Gao had them pack it very carefully. It was not only tied tightly with straw ropes outside, but also padded with sawdust and rice straw inside. They were all taken out and placed on the beds and floor, filling the entire room.

Wen Desi was holding a digital camera to take pictures, while Xiao Zishan was making a registration form on the side.

"127 pieces in total," Xiao Zishan said, "The quality is uneven. Some are quite rough."

"This is private kiln goods for export, roughly made, so naturally it can't compare with the official kiln." Wen Desi put down the camera, "Okay, pack them all back."

"Take them back now?"

"Yes, take them back immediately." Wen Desi said, "Night is long and dreams are many. Although the law and order in this small county is okay, putting such precious things in the hotel is still worrying."

The wormhole was opened again. This time it was much easier. Because the energy was sufficient, the wormhole opening expanded to a diameter of 800mm, enough to push the baskets directly through.

After sending the things back, Wen Desi breathed a sigh of relief.

"These things, if realized, should be enough for our start-up capital."

"But, how to realize them is a problem." Xiao Zishan said worriedly, "If so many Ming Dynasty porcelains appear on the market at once, it will definitely arouse suspicion."

"Don't worry about this." Wen Desi said confidently, "I have my own way. I have a friend who is doing antique business in Hong Kong. He has wide connections and can help us deal with it. We just need to pay him a certain commission."

"Is it reliable?"

"Absolutely reliable. We have been friends for many years." Wen Desi said, "Besides, we don't have to sell them all at once. We can take our time, selling a few pieces at a time, like squeezing toothpaste."

"That's good." Xiao Zishan nodded, "Then what should we do next?"

"Purchase." Wen Desi waved his hand, "Purchase in large quantities! We need to buy all kinds of materials and equipment to prepare for the future collective time travel."

"But we only have this little money..."

"There will be money." Wen Desi smiled mysteriously, "Don't forget, we have a whole world as our backing."

The next day, Xiao Zishan and Wang Luobin went to the local bank to exchange the gold. Because the quantity was large, they ran to several banks separately to get it done. The 600 taels of gold were exchanged for nearly 1.5 million RMB.

With money, their waists were hardened immediately.

First, they bought a second-hand Jinbei van for transportation. Then they rented a warehouse in the suburbs as a transit station for materials.

Wen Desi was responsible for contacting his Hong Kong friend to deal with the porcelain. Xiao Zishan and Wang Luobin were responsible for purchasing various materials in the local area.

Their purchase list was very miscellaneous, ranging from daily necessities such as grain, oil, rice and noodles to industrial raw materials such as steel and cement. There were also various tools, medicines, seeds, books... almost everything.

In order not to attract attention, they adopted the strategy of purchasing in small quantities and multiple batches. They bought a little here today and a little there tomorrow. Moreover, they mostly chose those wholesale markets and small shops where management was not very strict.

A week later, the first batch of funds from selling porcelain arrived. A full 3 million!

Wen Desi's friend was indeed capable. He sold more than a dozen pieces of the best porcelain in a short time and sold them for a good price.

With this huge sum of money, their purchasing efforts were even greater.

They began to order some large equipment, such as diesel generators, small machine tools, agricultural machinery, etc. These things couldn't be bought in the small county, so they had to go to the nearby big cities to order.

Wang Luobin, as a mechanical enthusiast, played a huge role at this time. He was responsible for selecting equipment models and checking the quality. Xiao Zishan was responsible for bargaining and logistics transportation.

The two cooperated tacitly and purchased a large amount of materials in a short time.

The warehouse in the suburbs was quickly filled up.

Every night, Wen Desi would come to the warehouse, open the wormhole, and transport the materials to the Ming Dynasty.

Master Gao's newly bought house came in handy. This was a three-entry courtyard house, located in a remote alley in the west of the city. Usually few people came. The backyard was spacious enough to stack a lot of things.

Wen Desi arranged for two reliable transmigrators (who joined later) to guard here specifically responsible for receiving and storing materials.

In this way, like ants moving house, they transported modern industrial products to the Ming Dynasty bit by bit, and then transported the Ming Dynasty's precious specialties back to modern times to exchange for funds.

A trans-space-time trade chain was initially formed.

However, as the scale of trade expanded, problems followed.

First, the throughput of the wormhole was limited. The maximum diameter was only about one meter, and large equipment couldn't pass through at all. They had to disassemble the equipment into parts, transport them over, and then assemble them. This not only consumed time and energy but also required professional technicians.

Second, the energy consumption of the wormhole was increasing. Every time it opened and maintained, it consumed a lot of energy. Although they could use electricity to recharge in modern times, in the Ming Dynasty, there was no electricity. They could only rely on bringing fully charged batteries or generating electricity with diesel generators. This greatly limited the frequency and duration of use.

Third, the confidentiality issue. Buying materials and selling antiques in large quantities would attract the attention of interested people sooner or later. Moreover, their activities in the Ming Dynasty also began to attract the attention of local forces.

"We must speed up." At a regular meeting, Wen Desi said with a serious expression, "The existence of the wormhole is unstable. We don't know when it will disappear. We must accumulate enough materials and personnel before it disappears to establish a solid base in the Ming Dynasty."

"I suggest we expand the recruitment scale." Xiao Zishan proposed, "We need more people, especially professionals in various fields. Mechanics, doctors, agronomists, soldiers... We need them all."

"I agree." Wang Luobin nodded, "But the audit must be strict. We can't let unreliable people in."

"I have an idea." Wen Desi's eyes flashed, "We can recruit people in the name of a 'survival game' or 'outdoor adventure club'. First screen a batch of enthusiasts on the Internet, then organize some offline activities to observe their abilities and character, and finally select suitable candidates to absorb into the core team."

"This method is good!" Xiao Zishan clapped his hands in praise, "It can conceal people's eyes and ears and select talents."

"Then let's do it." Wen Desi made the final decision, "Zishan, you are responsible for posting recruitment posts on the forum. Luobin, you are responsible for formulating assessment standards. I will coordinate the funds and materials."

"Yes!"

A vigorous recruitment plan for transmigrators kicked off.
