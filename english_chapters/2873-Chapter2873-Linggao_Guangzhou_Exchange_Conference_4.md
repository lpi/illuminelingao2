# Chapter 2873: Lingao-Guangzhou Exchange Conference (4)

Seeing this rich young master push his luck, Qingruo felt anger rising in her heart too. In the private rooms daily, guests indulged in pleasure, and inevitably some got carried away and made suggestive remarks to the waitresses. She had seen it all. She was no "greenhorn" fresh off the boat and wouldn't easily take offense—she could handle it all. But even if guests were willful, they wouldn't be so forward as to get handsy right off the bat.

This Master Mi had been a patron of hers back in the pleasure house days. Back then, he wasn't a particularly objectionable customer. Who knew what had gotten into him today! But though she was angry inside, her face still wore a smile. She said with a gentle laugh: "This gentleman is truly amusing. I suppose he wants me to match couplets, with whoever fails having to drink a penalty. Then this humble servant shall match—'Wine in the cup, not drinking makes you a pup; A pair of oily hands, just like pig's trotter stumps.'"

As her words fell, all the gentry at the table—except for Fu Bu'er, who still sat there dazed—burst into laughter. Mi Yijing had rolled around in pleasure quarters for years; his face had long grown thicker than city walls. He said shamelessly: "Such literary talent, miss, such talent. I'll drink a cup myself." With that, he drained his cup.

Qingruo immediately smiled and curtsied: "Master is most magnanimous." With that, she made to withdraw.

"What? You won't even drink one cup with me?" Mi Yijing blocked her way.

"This servant is merely an attendant here. By the rules, I cannot accompany guests in drinking."

"Oh?" Mi Yijing tapped his fingertip on the table, looking at Qingruo from the corner of his eye, smiling as if it were the most natural thing in the world. "Oh my, my dear Miss Qing, how have you been?" He deliberately dragged out "Miss" extra long, his voice carrying that particular raspiness from the courtesan quarters. "After all these years apart, I've missed you so. What's this? Now you've changed your signboard and don't acknowledge old patrons? Don't forget, back when you were at Lotus Fragrance Court, I, Master Mi, supported you for a full three months!"

These few words were like lifting a curtain, scattering Qingruo's past all over the room. The gentry at the table exchanged glances, both curious and not daring to interject. In fact, several Guangzhou elite who frequently visited pleasure houses had already recognized Qingruo. But seeing her current appearance and occupation, they pretended not to know her. Who would have thought this rash fool would expose her in public?

Yet Qingruo didn't even flutter her eyelashes. She maintained that same mild smile. "Master Mi has quite a good memory." She curtsied, her voice neither too loud nor too soft. "This humble one remembers your patronage back in the day. Now, thanks to Senator Pei's favor, I manage the singing troupe at Ziming Tower—I sell art, not smiles. If you're feeling nostalgic, why not request a tune? This humble servant will make an exception and sing one for you as a way of returning the favor of those years."

One sentence drew the boundary crystal clear. How could Mi Yijing accept this soft rebuff? He casually toyed with the gold ingot used as a paperweight, tapping it on the table's edge with a clinking sound: "Cut the act! I know full well what the top girl at Lotus Fragrance Court cost! Back then, I paid ten taels for one song from you, and now you're changing your tune? Enough with the pretense. Name your price. How much for a night in the outer quarters? I'll pay it, plus double 'name-change money'!"

As he spoke, his left hand had already circled around Qingruo's waist, his fingertips hooked on her sash, and with a light tug, the bow loosened halfway with a soft rustle. Qingruo felt a chill on her back but didn't dodge. Instead, she spun with the momentum, letting the sash slip through Mi Yijing's fingers like an elusive silk fish that refused to be caught. Her voice remained soft, yet it carried a crispness from her old days of dealing with flighty customers:

"Your Lordship's favor is appreciated; this humble one is grateful. But Ziming Tower isn't Lotus Fragrance Court. The rules here aren't those of the Great Ming. Since Your Lordship comes here to enjoy yourself, you must follow Australian rules."

She smiled with every sentence, yet every sentence raised "rules" above all else. Mi Yijing was caught mid-air, his heart itching like cats' claws, yet he couldn't very well tear the pretense apart in public. So he simply leaned in closer, nearly brushing her ear, and said in a voice only the two of them could hear:

"Playing coy with me? Forgotten that night you begged me to ransom your freedom? 'If Master Mi can save me from this fire and water, Qingruo will serve at your side for life'—those were your own words. Now the water's receded and the fire's out, and you want to welch on the debt?"

His voice was low, but he deliberately breathed hot air into Qingruo's ear, reeking of wine and provocation. A flash of cold light finally passed through the corner of Qingruo's eyes, but it vanished in an instant. She tilted her head slightly, letting a strand of loose hair by her ear fall down, blocking Mi Yijing's breath. Her voice was soft as the strumming of a pipa's rolling notes in the old courtyard:

"Your Lordship has quite a memory, still recalling this humble one's foolish words from those days. But times have changed—"

Her fingertip traced a light line on the tabletop, leaving a trail of moisture, as if wiping away an old debt with one stroke. "If Your Lordship had rescued this humble servant from the life of wind and dust back then, naturally I would serve by Your Lordship's side. But it was the Australians who saved me. Now I eat Australian grain, and my contract is with Ziming Tower, not your Mi Residence. If you come to enjoy yourself according to the rules, this servant will pour your tea and serve you. If you don't follow the rules, I cannot oblige."

The words were soft as cotton, yet each one cut like a knife, pressing down on the words "Senator" with heavy weight. Mi Yijing was furious inside, but his face smiled even more brazenly. He suddenly stood up straight, grabbed two wine cups from the table, and thrust them at Qingruo:

He pressed his cup hard against Qingruo's lips. The rim had rouge on it, leaving a faint lip print. "Back then you fed me; now I feed you. One cup for one cup—call it interest!"

Qingruo lowered her eyes to look at that lip print. A flash of disgust finally crossed her gaze. Yet she still didn't take the cup, only raising her hand to push the wine away. Her voice was pressed very low, yet loud enough for those at the nearby tables to hear:

"At Lotus Fragrance Court, wine was for honoring guests; at Ziming Tower, wine is for honoring rules. If Your Lordship forces this drink, you're forcing this humble one to break rules. And when rules are broken here, there's no room for old feelings. Don't forget, Your Lordship, you are a guest of the Senate. Don't lose face for the Senators..."

Mi Yijing's heart jolted, but his grip only tightened. He simply blocked Qingruo with his whole body, blocking the others' view, and laughed softly:

"Using the Senators to pressure me? When you were singing tunes in my arms back then, you weren't this spirited."

His right hand secretly reached for Qingruo's waist to pinch her. If he pinched hard, Qingruo would surely cry out in pain, and then he could counterattack, claiming she was "putting on airs." Just as his fingertips touched her thin blouse, he grabbed at empty air—Qingruo's entire form had slipped under his arm using the motion of a curtsey, her steps so light she seemed to be treading on cotton. She stood steady at arm's length away, her voice still not loud, yet audible throughout the room:

"Your Lordship, please choose your words carefully. Lotus Fragrance Court is old scenery; Ziming Tower is a new chapter. No matter how beautiful the old scenery, it cannot cover the seal of the new chapter. If Your Lordship truly values old feelings, then please be gracious and don't make things difficult for this humble one—or embarrassing for yourself."

The word "embarrassing" was like a sleeve-wind slapped down in public, stinging Mi Yijing's ears. When he tried to pursue, he saw Qingruo had already retreated to the beaded curtain, curtsied deeply, her green dress flowing like water, and vanished in an instant. The curtain swayed a few times, then returned to stillness, leaving only a wisp of cold fragrance drifting among the cooking oil and wine fumes—like an old tune with new words, ending abruptly.

Mi Yijing stood frozen in place. After a long moment, he spat a "bah," raised his foot to kick over a stool, but then remembered he had come to Lingao bearing his whole family's fortunes, so he could only force down that surge of anger, burning his own ear tips red. The gentry throughout the room, seeing there was no more entertainment, each lowered their heads to pick at their food, yet couldn't help exchanging glances—Young Master Mi's "old flame" obviously hadn't been rekindled. Instead, she had used the word "rules" to peel off a layer of his face in public.

Mi Yijing was left standing there, his face flushed. Gao Ju had already risen first and reached over half the table to press down on his shoulder, the palm carrying the subtle force practiced in officialdom, though his tone was as mild as casual conversation:

"Master Mi! Today is a banquet courtesy of Chairman Wang, and also a welcome for our fellow countrymen from Guangzhou. If we cause any kind of scene, when the report goes up tomorrow, Chairman Wang won't look good. Your father just won that 'South Sea Fertilizer Powder' project in the city, and he's counting on the Senate's continued support. Ruining proper business over a woman isn't worth it."

A few words both beat and cajoled, bringing up Chairman Wang while also pointing out the Mi family's new venture. Mi Yijing's veins by his ear throbbed a few times, but he finally stopped struggling. Gao Ju smoothly called toward the door: "Someone come! Bring a hot towel for Master Mi, and steep a pot of strong Pu'er to sober him up. Bring two bottles of iced Kvass as well." Turning back, he smiled at everyone: "Please pour for yourselves, everyone. Let's use tea in place of wine and continue listening to the tunes."

The Licentiate Liu nearby was the most skilled at playing along and quickly chimed in: "Yes, yes, yes. The singing troupe has been waiting for half the day; their throats must be itching. Miss Qingruo went to urge the food and will be back shortly. Let's request a 'Full Bloom and Round Moon' first!"

Everyone echoed in agreement, as if trying to bury the earlier embarrassment under liveliness. Two attendants came in, one on each side, to help Mi Yijing sit down. A hot towel pressed against his face, the white steam obscuring those bloodshot eyes. Mi Yijing's chest heaved, but knowing that making more of a scene would only bring disaster to his family, he could only take advantage of the slope to get off the donkey. He sulkily drank a glass of iced Kvass, still muttering under his breath: "...Just you wait."

Fu Bu'er watched this grand show, feeling quite pleased. He held a handful of melon seeds, having not risen or spoken from beginning to end. Now he cracked one open with a "crack," the shell splitting into two pieces, and his thoughts also split into a few murmurs.

*A whore is a whore. Change the building and she's still got that foxy bone. Putting on airs of what? But... heh, she really did smooth out this provincial master. That timing, that sense of proportion—every retreat and advance calculated precisely. These musician household girls really aren't to be underestimated!*

He stole a glance at Gao Ju. Chairman Gao's face was stacked with layers of smile lines, like the drape before a shrine, covering everything up completely. You couldn't see a hint of human emotion. Fu Bu'er clicked his tongue inwardly: *Official types really do talk pretty—every sentence a soft knife, cutting people without a temper.* Then he turned to look at Mi Yijing—that face was steamed purple by the hot towel, looking like a pig's bladder inflated on a winter day, yet unable to get angry. Fu Bu'er suddenly found it funny. His mouth cracked open, nearly swallowing the shell of the melon seed. He hurriedly coughed twice to cover it up.

Someone came to pour tea for him. He waved his hand, his mind continuing to mutter:

*That Qingruo girl... bah, lowly class, but this move of 'soft knife cutting flesh' is even sharper than the sickle in my field.*

Thinking this, he actually felt a kind of schadenfreude, grabbed another handful of melon seeds, and cracked them noisily.
