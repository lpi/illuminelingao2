# Chapter 1631 - The Politics Lesson

If there was really a full Senate vote, whether the land reform proposal would win was hard to say. That was why land policy had become the G-spot of all Senators—no one dared to poke at it, so it kept being put off.

Now facing the pressing reality of "fighting back to the Mainland," it really couldn't be delayed any longer. Supervisor Ma expressing himself so obliquely was definitely not just this one instance in the special class; there might be new findings in the latest theoretical journals too.

His mind was spinning in circles, but his mouth was already tearing Latin America apart until there was barely anything left.

Latin Americanization was one of the main narrative contexts of the "China Collapse Theory." When Liu Xiang was playing "Keyboard Politburo" back in the day, he had put in quite a bit of effort on this, and now rattled off a large passage of lecturing without taking a breath.

Just as the rambling was going off into the ether, Qian Xuanhuang came to report that Master and Madam had called saying they wouldn't come back today and had to "hold a temporary enlarged meeting."

Both Liu Xiang and Qian Shuixie were startled. Although there had been some political turmoil recently due to the martial arts drama, the surrounding environment was excessively quiet. There was no major action in any direction. Apart from a few departments, various agencies rarely worked through the night. Could something have happened?

"In that case, I'll take my leave first. I'll come to pay my respects to Speaker Qian again tomorrow." Liu Xiang rose to say goodbye.

"I'm really sorry..." Qian Shuixie looked apologetic.

"It's fine, it's fine. It's rare leisure time for me too." Liu Xiang said, "I'll come again tomorrow when Speaker Qian has time."

"Good, good."

"Then we'll take our leave as well." The members of the Girls' Sailor Team also said their goodbyes.

*Speaking of which, what's the deal with this "temporary enlarged meeting"? Judging from the meeting format, it's probably not a small matter! What's the situation with Ai Beibei attending as well? The health department... is there an epidemic?*

As Liu Xiang stood on the deck watching the Girls' Sailor Team's carriage disappear into the night, he couldn't help muttering in his heart.

"Yunmi, the stuff Teacher Liu said today, didn't we also find some of it in the Grand Library? Why specifically ask about it?"

Little Lin and Little Zhang were whispering in the same carriage.

"Asking always yields something! At least didn't you get another writing direction on your side?" Zhang Yunmi didn't know what she was thinking, responding absent-mindedly.

"That's not right. After that attack, I felt like you became more withdrawn, not as cheerful as before. But today you were so proactive." Little Lin suddenly pulled Zhang Yunmi into her arms. "Didn't we promise to be together for life! Darling wife, don't abandon me! Whatever you do, don't look for a middle-aged man!"

"Not look for a middle-aged man, and wait for your little pet Zhuo Min to grow up instead!" Zhang Yunmi pushed Lin Ziqi away with a look of disgust.

"No, no, no! That's not the point! Wife, wife, are you really going to look for a middle-aged man? No way! You're the number one idol!" 

"Can I be an idol forever? Besides, doesn't being an idol attract those otaku middle-aged men anyway? This kind of thing is just for fun, how can you take it seriously? As for those monkeys in the Selection Group, whether you're an idol or not, there's always a bunch of 'ambitious' ones with bootlicking faces trying to get close." Zhang Yunmi had a troubled look. "I like dressing up nicely and singing and dancing, but I can't dedicate dance as a career like Teacher Liu [Wencai, not Liu Xiang]. Hobbies and work are two different things!"

"Hey, hey, hey, wife! Are! You! Really! Seriously! Considering! This!!!" Lin Ziqi was truly surprised this time, asking word by word.

"After the New Year is over, the First Five-Year Plan will be finished. We'll have voting rights at the Second Five-Year Plan Congress. You really don't understand what this means?" Zhang Yunmi sighed.

Little Lin's mouth was agape, not knowing what to say. Although her bestie had been withdrawn lately, she only thought Little Zhang was stimulated and needed time to recover. She didn't expect Little Zhang was thinking about these issues.

"But, but... these middle-aged men all have lifestyle secretaries already!" Lin Ziqi finally connected again, though it didn't follow Little Zhang's logic just now.

"Then what else? Live like Teacher Wu or Auntie Du? Or find a naturalized citizen? Setting aside whether he'd take a mistress—I doubt they'd dare—would there be any common language?" Little Zhang said, shaking her head. "When your little pet Zhuo Min is trained up, then it might be possible. Good luck, I have high hopes for you!"

"But, but, why Teacher Liu? Aren't there some like Manor Owner Lu who are closer in age?"

"Yeah, those guys have been trying to get us to call them 'Onii-chan' for years, and it had to be at sweetness level four-plus! Only now do I know what a bunch of lolicon perverts!" Zhang Yunmi vented viciously.

"Umm... but, why Teacher Liu..."

"From the moment we got on the carriage, when did I ever say it was him! Don't worry, he's not my type. I was just talking about our tragic fate as female Senators!" Not to be outdone, Zhang Yunmi pulled Lin Ziqi into her arms: "Keep talking nonsense, and you won't sleep tonight!" As she spoke, she grabbed Lin Ziqi's pair of buns from behind and kneaded them vigorously.

"Wife! Please spare me! Speaking of which, aren't you the one mooching a bed at my place tonight! How are you still so fierce! Don't, ah..." Lin Ziqi begged for mercy while squealing.

The atmosphere in the carriage was ambiguous. The coachman and the guards outside each had awkward expressions...

Poor Zhang Yunmi still had no idea what major event had happened today that required an enlarged meeting to be convened; even less did she know that the agenda of this enlarged meeting was closely related to her.

In the classroom of the Primus Class at the Academy, only a few people sat scattered about. The faces of the classmates were all very blurry, yet their names could be called out accurately. On the podium, a slightly plump figure was lecturing about something.

"...Right now, the syllabus for the 'Politics' course is still being compiled. What exactly to teach hasn't been completely decided. But some consensus has been reached, and these things that have reached consensus are what I am going to teach you...

"...Speaking from my experience, I can only say that the politics class in our schools back then was the one that told the most truth. The state is a violent machine for the ruling class to maintain its rule, the law is a tool for the ruling class to maintain its rule, there are individuals who betray their class but no class that betrays its interests...

"...No matter whether you have mathematical talent in the future or not, statistics must be studied well. This is the foundation of all social sciences. Without statistics, social science majors cannot be called 'science' at all. And correspondingly, if you learn statistics well, you will have mastered a modern art of governance! Today we will talk about the statistical concept we hear most often in our original spacetime, the so-called GDP..."

"...In this world, never inherit your past way of thinking again. You must establish the consciousness of the ruling class."

Such a powerful sentence made Lin Ziqi open her eyes.

She had fallen asleep again. She quickly raised her head—in any spacetime, she didn't like listening to politics class. She always felt it didn't have much to do with her.

Looking at Zhang Yunmi again, her eyes were bright and focused. Thinking about the whispered conversation between them in bed this morning: about the future, about "boyfriends," and some "unsuitable for minors"...

She was lost in thought when suddenly the door was knocked and opened. A naturalized citizen academic secretary entered, who was also Principal Zhang's lifestyle secretary. She said a few words in his ear. Zhang Zhixiang, who had been spitting rhetoric, immediately stopped the lesson and said, "Study by yourselves for now," then hurried out.

Fangcaodi [Fragrant Grass Field] was now completely different from the beginning—except for the statue at the entrance with its ambiguous meaning and its 80s-era style. Although the playground track was still made of cinders, the grass in the middle had changed from weeds to specially cultivated grass varieties; the teaching building had also been expanded with two wings. A new library had been specially built. The "practical training classroom," which had originally just been a reed mat shed, had also become a neat factory building. The school motto on the wall had been freshly repainted, and a newly designed Fangcaodi exclusive coat of arms had been added.

He ran into his former colleague Xiao Zhaochuan and, after greeting him, asked about Hu Qingbai's current teaching location. Today was Monday. After the flag-raising ceremony, he had gone to the lecture hall to give "Weekly Current Events" political education to the Selection Group students. Leaving behind Xiao Zhaochuan, whose pile of papers was already high enough to bury his eyes, Liu Xiang headed straight for the lecture hall.

The lecture hall had been built with great care back in the day. After all, amplification equipment couldn't be guaranteed long-term, so making full use of the building's internal structure was inevitable. At that time, the construction company was "full of talents" and "brimming with expertise," unlike now where most had changed careers, leaving only Mei Wan, Qi Feng, and a few others still holding down the fort. Back then, everyone had put all their effort into the lecture hall project, personally taking turns to supervise the work, then testing the sound effects, and finally making patches before finishing it. So now, even though Liu Xiang had just arrived at the door, he could clearly hear Hu Qingbai's voice. He reached out and tested—the door was unlocked as expected. Walking in quietly, Hu Qingbai saw Liu Xiang. After a moment, he remembered this former subordinate and didn't make a fuss, only slowing down his speech slightly. Opening the door naturally made a sound, but the students didn't stir. Only a few boys twisted their bodies wanting to turn around and look but controlled themselves.

"The discipline is not bad!" Liu Xiang found the nearest empty seat and sat down, sighing with emotion.

"...I think Chen Guangji's reflection from last time was the best written. It's not because the depth of his thinking was particularly profound, but because of his use of Mandarin, that breath of life in his writing—it's stronger than most people. When everyone writes articles, from time to time you use your hometown dialect. Some dialect characters have no corresponding Mandarin characters, and you still substitute a similar-sounding one." Hu Qingbai praised this Chen Guangji student well, then called on everyone to learn from him. Following the students' gazes, Liu Xiang found this slightly thin and slender student, his head slightly lowered, his face flushed red. Liu Xiang nodded slightly.
